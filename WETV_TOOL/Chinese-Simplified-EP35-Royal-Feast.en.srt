1
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,760
tastes good

2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
just too hot

3
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,160
His Majesty

4
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,680
I'd better go outside and watch.

5
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,760
Souji Zen

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,879
It's your cooking that's so delicate

7
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,680
You can't wait

8
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,559
I'm going out to ask for pancakes

9
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,960
good, delicious

10
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,839
I'm coming

11
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,039
Yin Sishan

12
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,399
Even if the order of serving can be changed

13
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,119
That always has to follow the change from salty to light

14
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,759
The principle of thinning from thick to thin

15
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,039
you are so stupid

16
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
not only spoil the appetite

17
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
also lose the taste of the food

18
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,199
what is this

19
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,240
how have i never seen

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,600
Your Highness

21
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
This is a bag of rice crackers

22
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,039
just sauerkraut and eggplant

23
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,240
The taste is very crisp and delicious

24
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,639
really tasty

25
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
Brother, try it too

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
I see you are hungry

27
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
Where is this dish?

28
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,600
His Majesty

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Rumor has it that the Yuan Army

30
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,279
After retreating from Jiangxi Nan'an Prefecture

31
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,160
Food in the city was looted

32
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,919
a clever woman

33
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,679
Remnants of broken rice found on the ground

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
collect it

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,839
Grind into rice milk

36
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,600
Steamed in a dustpan

37
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,119
Wrapped with various fillings

38
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,559
Brush with cooked tea oil

39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,960
It's a very delicious package of rice crackers

40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,839
really delicious

41
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,440
looks normal

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
It's very fragrant

43
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,359
Your Highness

44
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,839
No matter how hungry you are, don't be in a hurry

45
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,200
This soup dumpling doesn't seem to be hot

46
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:28,839
accidentally

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,679
can burn your heart

48
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,519
You are right

49
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,640
Rumors of the Three Kingdoms

50
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,399
Sun Quan married his sister to Liu Bei

51
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,519
Mrs. Sun loved to eat crabs since she was a child

52
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
away from homeland

53
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,799
I miss it even more

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,760
Later someone used crab roe as filling

55
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
to make soup dumplings

56
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
just in memory of her

57
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,320
It's hot

58
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
still have to eat it hot

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,839
It will have a crab smell when it cools down

60
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,200
Feichangfen with Juntun Guokui

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
This helmet

62
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,760
the Three Kingdoms period

63
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,480
General Jiang Wei

64
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,959
What about the military rations handed down?

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
You, you have a taste

66
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,359
forgot to remind you

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,799
There's pepper powder

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
You still have to try the fried cake first

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Or candy canes

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,559
You adult

71
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,119
how are you

72
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,519
Do you see me as alright?

73
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,359
adult forgiveness

74
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,279
Pepper powder that I grind by myself

75
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,279
the taste is heavier

76
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,160
You are afraid that you will put a pot of pepper powder

77
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,720
Send it all to me

78
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
Yunzhou often leaves the Beijing office for business trips

79
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,880
Food from all over the world

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,799
have tasted it

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,880
there are still

82
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,079
what you can't eat

83
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,200
The world's delicious clouds gather in China

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,720
Even three meals a day

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,320
Eat fresh food

86
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,600
People live to be a thousand years old

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,959
I'm afraid I won't be able to eat it

88
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
This is the sheep's head sign

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,119
Song Dynasty Prime Minister Wang Anshi

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
Seeing fame and wealth as floating clouds

91
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,880
Only when reading late at night

92
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,519
I love this sheep's head tag

93
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,920
To say that the palace does the sheep's head sign

94
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
the best person

95
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,920
Not a cook in the house

96
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,399
Not Mrs. Wang

97
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,679
but

98
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,279
who is it

99
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,519
This story has to be told slowly

100
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,160
Concubine Sun

101
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,399
I like Yin Sishan's story

102
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,640
Let her cook for me in the future

103
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
queen concubine

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,679
Su Sishan was taken by you personally

105
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,160
Now even Yin Sishan has to beg

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Then if I'm not used to eating

107
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,519
meals made by others

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
then what should we do

109
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:20,880
I will exchange with you

110
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,600
This

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm afraid it's not good

112
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,760
Since the queen likes

113
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,799
Then let Yin Sishan

114
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,679
Let's prepare meals for Kunning Palace in the future

115
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
thank you your majesty

116
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,279
slave servant

117
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,160
can't wait any longer

118
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,679
Now is the best time

119
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,440
slow

120
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,000
go down

121
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,279
They were prepared

122
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,480
withdraw

123
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,679
go

124
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,000
Eunuch Chen did not stay outside the house

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,880
serve your majesty

126
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,399
where did this go

127
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,000
Yin Sishan wants to prepare meals

128
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,719
The slaves go around

129
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,400
go around

130
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm going to change clothes, you don't have to be restrained

131
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,359
Forgiveness

132
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,840
I did not do it on purpose

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
with you brother

134
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
My hair should be more white

135
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,679
Slave to see if the soup is ready

136
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,320
I went to see Yin Sishan

137
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,400
how to cook

138
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Empress please

139
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,239
The concubine is really generous

140
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,880
Even the cook gave it away

141
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,599
as far as I know

142
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,280
Yin Sishan can't understand Chinese and Chinese

143
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,320
Even though two years of reading and literacy

144
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,280
Not to the food

145
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,840
It's so precious

146
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,080
you say

147
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:45,080
Who is this storyteller?

148
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,479
by grace

149
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,080
how dare you question me

150
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,919
Really presumptuous

151
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,239
Do you know Chen Wu's subordinates?

152
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,400
How many Dongchang Fanzi are there?

153
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,559
There are some things that he can't even break through

154
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,599
There is a natural reason behind

155
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,719
Only after today

156
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,559
The eunuchs and officials involved

157
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,599
hate you to the bone

158
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,000
You don't even want fame

159
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,200
And me

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,359
is short-sighted

161
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
Just look at the eyes

162
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,400
I can't control the future

163
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,440
nothing

164
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,200
His Majesty

165
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,840
Concubine only likes

166
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,159
Fill this pot with rice noodles

167
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,679
no one can control

168
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,159
I'm all right

169
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,239
who can take care of you

170
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,599
what happened

171
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,919
That's about it

172
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,479
queen mother

173
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,640
Rong slave maid one more mouth

174
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,559
Now this Concubine Sun

175
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,159
Relying on His Majesty's love for her

176
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,119
That is lawless

177
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,400
as usual

178
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,039
Should be the Queen of the Palace

179
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
Enjoy the golden book

180
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,080
Concubine only grants gold book

181
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,520
But His Majesty bestowed upon her the precious concubine gold

182
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,799
you said this

183
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,840
It never happened in all dynasties

184
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,679
And the world

185
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,760
one and only glory

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,559
also said

187
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,119
if you didn't stop

188
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,880
It was already a big mistake

189
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,559
so

190
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,840
still you wise

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,640
Found him at a glance

192
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,599
what soup

193
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,799
what soup

194
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,039
what kind of soup

195
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,159
emperor

196
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,840
Not insisting on giving it to the Sun

197
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,039
Is the imperial concubine Jinbao?

198
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,119
tell him

199
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,840
I promised

200
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,479
stop

201
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,320
I taught you when you first entered the palace

202
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:53,880
what kind of dishes to use in bowls

203
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,440
What kind of dishes to serve

204
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,679
No matter how good the food

205
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,960
Also use beauty to match

206
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,239
you don't have a brain

207
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,239
Still no ears

208
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,960
did something wrong

209
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,440
And crying face

210
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,960
kneeling

211
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
The concubine greets the empress

212
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,679
come and sit

213
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,880
The Queen does not know

214
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,640
Yin Sishan is a close friend of Concubine Sun

215
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,039
Never bring wolves into the house

216
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,200
I know

217
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,280
Now that the Queen Mother knows

218
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,679
Why do you still believe this man

219
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,520
Yin Sishan came to cook for me

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,039
in front of the emperor

221
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,960
crossed the road

222
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,520
say more

223
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,440
Meals delivered to Kunning Palace

224
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,159
must be carefully checked

225
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,479
i'm not afraid

226
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
what are you worried about

227
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,719
Concubine Sun Guifei has a bad heart

228
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,919
good at attracting people

229
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:46,760
queen concubine

230
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Don't be fooled by her

231
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,039
keep the calamity by your side

232
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,200
say more

233
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,960
How many cooks are there in the food bureau

234
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,640
Yin Sishan's cooking skills are not necessarily the same

235
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:56,200
Fragrant and crispy

236
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,840
taste it

237
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,719
Although Yin Sishan was born as a palace maid

238
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,159
But the story of food

239
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,039
Like a lot of treasures

240
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,280
That story was well told

241
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,479
Tomorrow the maid will also come to listen

242
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,520
adult

243
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,719
The emperor suddenly called to accompany him

244
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,960
You have to be careful

245
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,960
what to watch out for

246
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,440
What to watch out for

247
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,119
adult

248
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,039
After the emperor's mausoleum returned to the palace

249
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,440
Heavily punished all officials involved

250
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,119
Wucheng soldiers and horses and patrol city censors

251
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,159
were severely reprimanded

252
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,679
What if the emperor takes anger on you?

253
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,440
adult

254
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,039
You adult

255
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,000
lets go

256
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,359
Eunuch Chen

257
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,039
Where are we going?

258
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
I'll tell you on the way

259
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,239
let me drive

260
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,400
is this

261
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,119
for safety

262
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
Two people from each faction

263
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,839
track along the way

264
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,280
Report immediately if there is news

265
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,160
Yes

266
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,040
you come with me

267
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:52,760
Yes

268
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,640
Eunuch Chen

269
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:42,680
people from your east factory

270
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,760
It's getting more and more capable

271
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,040
What did you say?

272
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,199
Jinyi Guard escorts

273
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,000
But the sun rises too late

274
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,599
Isn't it a fan called Dongchang?

275
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,719
Is the design distracted?

276
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:54,719
Your Majesty does not want to make a move

277
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,400
Also please don't be surprised

278
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,719
what are you looking at

279
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:01,760
old man

280
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,520
Still going down at such a young age

281
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,000
you work so hard

282
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,280
At first glance you are

283
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,599
The boy from the city

284
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,280
idlers don't know anything

285
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,880
not working hard

286
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,640
Go hungry

287
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
It is said that spring cultivation and summer cultivation

288
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,839
autumn harvest

289
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,560
naturally busy

290
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,719
wait till winter

291
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,959
You can always rest

292
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,560
winter

293
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
Do you have to do corvée in winter?

294
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,719
If you don't do well

295
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,880
That's going to kill your head

296
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,479
can i try

297
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,479
you

298
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:42,640
when i was young

299
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,719
I also went down with my grandfather

300
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:44,479
learned some

301
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,959
ok you try

302
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,040
man, this is impossible

303
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,359
stand back and don't get in the way

304
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,920
old man

305
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,880
Since it is so hard

306
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,439
Why don't you do business

307
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,199
Buying and selling is what you want to do

308
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,239
ancestors of farmers

309
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,439
farming honestly

310
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,400
As long as there is no natural disaster

311
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
I can still have a meal

312
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,880
run out of business

313
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,199
what about the capital

314
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,439
Pick a load a day

315
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,680
run two or three hundred miles

316
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,280
make a penny or two

317
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,560
Bad luck

318
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,479
can't even make a living

319
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,119
Rather than farming

320
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,359
Go! Go! Go

321
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,119
Who are they?

322
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,640
ask questions

323
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,160
you come out come out

324
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,280
hurry up hurry up

325
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,400
His Majesty

326
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,119
This weed is called man-cutting vine

327
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:54,199
barbed spines on leaves

328
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,079
easy to cut hands

329
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,560
Please be careful, Your Majesty

330
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,719
Yun Zhou really knows everything.

331
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,800
Although Wei Chen has never landed

332
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,800
But the fields

333
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,760
There is always news

334
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,079
It is no surprise to know some

335
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,199
this world

336
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,520
the hardest

337
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
the people who farm

338
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,599
indeed so

339
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,040
People all over the world do all kinds of industries

340
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,359
when not suffering

341
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,640
Who is not suffering

342
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,760
imperial concubine

343
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,079
you've gone for nothing

344
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,280
Long live out of the palace

345
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,959
Your Majesty has left the palace

346
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,959
Where did he go?

347
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,640
empress

348
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
you asked

349
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,199
we are slaves

350
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,640
How dare you ask where the master is going?

351
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,040
All right

352
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,959
empress

353
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,359
what else do you order

354
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,280
Akin

355
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,280
go

356
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,119
Director Yuan

357
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,560
Will Concubine Sun know?

358
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,439
What you sent to Guangdong for procurement

359
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,160
Go! Go! Go

360
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,800
Long live my childhood

361
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:34,800
long live sex

362
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,920
I know more than her

363
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not afraid of what you are afraid of

364
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:38,760
what are you afraid of

365
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,920
But

366
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,719
what can

367
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,560
I tell you

368
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,599
In this palace

369
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,359
no evergreens

370
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,000
just her

371
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,439
Relying on one's own kind of pet

372
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't know how much weight I have

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
pressed my head

374
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,719
press my head

375
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,400
look at you

376
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,239
I just look at this noble concubine

377
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,160
how long

378
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,439
don't say it

379
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:01,680
I want to play too

380
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,760
wait for me

381
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,479
hurry up

382
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:06,000
play me a while

383
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,800
hurry up

384
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,319
run slowly

385
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,160
Wait for me

386
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,760
hurry up

387
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,239
Wait for me

388
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:16,719
Come

389
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:17,959
are you alright

390
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:18,920
fine

391
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,479

I'll give you a bowl of water to drink

412
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,880
no water

413
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,160
wait a minute

414
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,319

thank you

417
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,920
Emperor Taizu built a nursing home at the beginning of the year

418
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,439
I just want to let the lonely old

419
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,319
The disabled are fed

420
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,520
But

421
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,040
His Majesty

422
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,839
Beijing City Nursing Home

423
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,439
orphans

424
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,800
There are four thousand five hundred people

425
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,560
The court is also burdened

426
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,079
The greatness of the world always has omissions

427
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,680
why do you blame yourself

428
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:43,680
Do not

429
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,359
I'm not good enough

430
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,119
I asked yesterday

431
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,160
How many refugees come to Beijing?

432
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:54,560
One by one hesitantly

433
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,520
cover up

434
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,800
i feel sad

435
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,800
if everyone

436
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,680
can be like you

437
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,640
Dedicated to duty

438
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,280
the people of this world

439
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,520
Maybe a lot better

440
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,920
Ancestors and Emperor Examinations

441
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,760
ignore your talents

442
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,479
from now on

443
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,959
I will let you show off your strengths

444
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,719
do what you really should do

445
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,400
water is coming

446
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:33,760
Come

447
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,199
Drink a bowl of water first

448
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:35,719
thanks

449
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,160
Come

450
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,119
sit down

451
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,199
Let the patrol press the censor

452
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,280
Recheck all over the place

453
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,599
Anyone who can be admitted to a nursing home by law

454
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,760
If the official refuses to adopt

455
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,119
Always weigh sixty

456
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,280
Who dares to deduct from it?

457
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,160
Severely punished

458
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,640
Yes

459
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,000
His Majesty

460
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,560
Time to go back to the palace

461
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,560
Queen Empress Appetite

462
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,640
It's been good recently

463
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,800
But like to eat

464
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,119
It's all dessert soup

465
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,680
When can we eat properly

466
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,760
queen concubine

467
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,199
Yin Sishan daily unitary hour

468
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,199
Go to Yongning Palace

469
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,079
Stay for an hour before turning around

470
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,239
madam you are this

471
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,280
now

472
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,719
It's her turn to pity me

473
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,079
empress

474
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,560
His Majesty

475
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,920
how are you injured

476
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,160
nothing

477
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,239
what about the memorial

478
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,040
The memorial is on the case

479
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,400
but

480
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:02,719
How did you come

481
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,119
His Majesty

482
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,439
His Majesty leaves the palace in micro-clothing

483
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
came back late at night

484
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,640
If the queen mother knew

485
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,439
How worried are you?

486
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,520
how to do things

487
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
Your Majesty's forgiveness

488
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:39,439
don't hurry to change

489
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,719
Concubines come

490
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,839
let them come

491
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
for the sake of the people

492
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,439
What's the point of doing little things

493
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,560
don't quit

494
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,040
Are you waiting to be scolded?

495
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,239
I went to many places today

496
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,640
I saw an old man

497
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,719
her children

498
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,239
died on the battlefield

499
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,719
Eat a full meal in two days

500
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,000
In addition to wild vegetable roots in the pot

501
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,880
nothing else

502
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,520
I am ashamed

503
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,719
i saw

504
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:32,839
feeling terrible

505
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,119
His Majesty

506
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,079
I know

507
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,479

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,560

510
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,839
Didn't alert Shang Food Bureau

511
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,239
The noodles are made by the concubine herself

512
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,119
don't mind your majesty

513
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,959
you're quite comfortable

514
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,640
Next time I'm coming back late

515
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,040
don't wait

516
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,959
His Majesty came back late at night

517
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,160
see the concubine

518
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Are you happy?

519
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,719
happy

520
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,239
The concubine will wait

521
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,239
No matter when His Majesty comes back

522
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,400
The concubine is waiting here

523
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,599
If you are tired of waiting

524
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,560
Would you like to take a nap in His Majesty's couch?

525
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,160
Are you really not afraid of criticism from the harem?

526
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,560
The concubine can't wait.

527
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,079
eat more

528
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:46,719
Okay

531
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,560
It tastes good today

532
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,079
Yes

533
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,119

537
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,839

538
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,000

544
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,760
be careful

545
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,479
how delicious

546
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,479
have a taste

547
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,359
This pie is delicious

548
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,560
adult

549
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,640
have a pie

550
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,160
adult

551
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,359
adult

552
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,639
Wait a moment

553
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,399
Niang Niang has an appetite now

554
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,199
not all day

555
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,679
only eat snacks

556
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,520
The slaves have prepared a meal today

557
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:52,879
madam, try it

558
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,439
Yin Sishan

559
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:03,840
what is this

560
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,399
This is the morning of the slaves

561
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,719
specially picked lotus root

562
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,600
for the queen

563
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,000
cooked this fried lotus

564
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,560
Heard that Xi Shi loves to pick lotus for cooking

565
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,600
Nourishes extraordinary beauty

566
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,239
So the rumors

567
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,879
Lotus can clear the heart and cool the blood

568
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,600
Even more beauty

569
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,719
porridge

570
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,560
Serve with fried shredded fish

571
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,159
most fragrant

572
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,560
Didn't you say it was hot yesterday?

573
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,719
The slaves specially prepared Sushan today

574
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,159
It's just that the mother-in-law has just resumed eating not long ago

575
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,239
Do not use too much

576
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:34,919
I'm afraid of hurting my body

577
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,159
queen concubine

578
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,719
I don't know what the servant did wrong

579
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,239
Only to make the concubine unhappy

580
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,199
empress

581
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,159
Concubine Sun was summoned

582
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,239
waiting outside the hall

583
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:50,719
you let her in

584
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,560
Yes

585
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,120
The concubine greets the empress

586
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,719
Poor servants serving meals

587
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,120
please forgive me

588
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,760
no need

589
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:16,679
Concubine Sun

590
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,520
take her back

591
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,919
I don't want to see her again

592
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,239
queen concubine

593
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:24,919
Yin Sishan

594
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,639
I have something to say to the queen

595
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,719
you step back

596
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,159
the queen mother hates me

597
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,439
It's because of Hu Shangshi

598
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,639
Concubine Sun

599
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,919
I know your majesty loves you very much

600
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,520
But I am in the middle palace after all

601
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,320
You are going too far

602
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,520
not previously explained

603
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,560
because it is obvious

604
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,159
Yi Niang Niang's Wisdom

605
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,120
How could there be such a misunderstanding

606
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:15,800
unless

607
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,159
you will

608
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,600
Dissatisfaction and anger over the loss of a loved one

609
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,439
vented on me

610
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,399
Sister sincerely pray to God

611
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,879
May you live in peace and joy

612
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
This wish is enough

613
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
If you did not enter the palace

614
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,280
Without you in the world

615
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:41,719
queen concubine

616
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,120
you lost your sister

617
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,040
what about me

618
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,479
you took the back seat

619
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,719
There is no place in this world where I stand

620
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:51,919
this world

621
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,479
There is no one to protect me

622
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:55,520
my past situation

623
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,479
Have you ever thought about

624
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,719
Everything is ordained by God

625
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,439
people

626
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,239
Can you deny your fate?

627
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,080
you look at me

628
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,040
Is my life set in stone?

629
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,320
Life is full of twists and turns

630
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,040
Unpredictable

631
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,879
Why do you want to admit your fate

632
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:19,600
That half year

633
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
what are you thinking

634
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,000
water

635
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,360
Benefit all things without fighting

636
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,800
the most painful situation

637
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,600
I will tell myself

638
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,959
If there are rocks ahead

639
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
then take a detour

640
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:40,760
Can't get around that?

641
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,520
If you can't get around

642
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,879
There will always be a day when a drop of water wears a stone

643
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,080
The emperor goes on tour

644
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,320
Hai Shi only returned to the palace

645
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,600
It's been four watch since I finished approving the memorial

646
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Just because he wants to be a

647
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,320
King of the Holy Spirit

648
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,959
Somebody is deceiving

649
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:00,919
confusion

650
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,800
Then he can only see for himself

651
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,959
to listen to

652
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,800
Even the soles of the boots are torn

653
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,959
The emperor still has all kinds of unsatisfactory

654
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,679
What about ordinary people?

655
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,399
queen concubine

656
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,479
Please refresh your spirits

657
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,560
to live well

658
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:49,639
empress

659
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,959
The food is cold

660
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,600
I clearly ordered that there was no need to deliver meals anymore.

661
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,840
But when you turn your face, you change your mind

662
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,439
who are you

663
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,000
How to persuade the queen

664
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,159
hot weather

665
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,639
Your Majesty must be heartbroken

666
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,560
more irritable

667
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,879
Should be used more on weekdays

668
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,639
heat-clearing food

669
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,080
I read all the menus you sent me

670
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,719
Several dishes have scallion peppers in them

671
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,120
such dry food

672
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,159
It's all changed

673
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,000
why don't you speak

674
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,080
watch what i do

675
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,040
Yes

676
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,040
all changed

677
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,120
then i go back

678
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,239
Mingming is concerned about His Majesty's diet and daily life

679
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,280
so carefully

680
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,199
But others are still talking about you behind your back

681
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,439
say you are cunning

682
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,479
kindness

683
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:24,679
His Majesty

684
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,239
Playing in the palm of your hand

685
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,560
then you see

686
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:28,879
Your majesty is easy

687
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,280
Do you have a manly temperament?

688
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,800
you

689
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,159
Come in for lunch later

690
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,000
let them talk

691
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,320
gone

692
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,080
do you have a son

693
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,879
I asked if you have a son

694
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:08,600
The minister has two sons

695
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:10,760
have two sons

696
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,239
what about you

697
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,800
Don't send your son to study craftsmanship

698
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,679
Your Majesty I

699
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:15,280
Not enough craftsmen

700
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,679
Stop the useless project

701
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,000
Why would you want to go to Yingtianfu?

702
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,040
Choose 5,000 children to come to Beijing to learn art

703
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,520
You are also a father

704
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:26,080
I don't understand compassion and compassion

705
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,199
the hearts of other parents

706
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:28,439
His Majesty

707
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:29,439
This

708
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,959
This is the arrangement of the internal officials.

709
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,520
The minister is telling the truth

710
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:36,800
tell the truth

711
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,959
As Minister of Industry

712
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:42,040
Should you listen or not

713
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,080
should not play

714
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,320
roll

715
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,840
You are also in charge of the internal officials.

716
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,159
His Majesty

717
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:01,760
I have no idea

718
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,479
I really don't know, Your Majesty

719
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:04,800
it's not me

720
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,280
Your Majesty Your Majesty

721
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:07,000
wronged

722
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,639
wronged
