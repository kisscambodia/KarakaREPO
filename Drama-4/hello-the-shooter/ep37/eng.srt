00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,559
This is your mother's strong suit.

36
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,720
All talk and no action.

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,720
Sit.

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
Alright, all the dishes are served.

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,239
I'll make a toast?

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,879
Okay, come.

41
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,400
Okay.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,199
Shen,

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,239
you came to our house

44
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,080
for the first time,

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,760
so you need to do as I say.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You drink the white one,

47
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,760
and we drink red wine.

48
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,199
Come on, cheers.

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,319
Dad.

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,360
Shen Qingyuan is an athlete.

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
He cannot drink alcohol.

52
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,680
Look how worried she is.

53
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:05,919
I tell you what,

54
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,720
it's just water.

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,039
I know he's an athlete,

56
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,199
so the fish and the meat,

57
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:14,960
and all the other dishes

58
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,800
were selected
by the dietary standard

59
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,919
for athletes.

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,800
I spent

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,119
so much time at the market

62
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,360
selecting the ingredients.

63
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,360
I forgot the green cabbage.

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,000
Alright, alright.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
The kids are still growing.

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,240
Fish and meat are good enough.

67
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,759
Good enough?

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,559
Good enough.

69
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

70
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,759
Thank you, Mom.

71
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,160
Good.

72
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,000
- Very good, very good.
- Wait.

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,440
Why not Dad?

74
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,360
Thank you, Dad.

75
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,240
That's more like it.

76
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,800
Come on.

77
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Happy New Year!

78
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,600
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

79
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,000
She really doesn't need my help?

80
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,039
No.

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,119
You go talk to my dad.

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
But the guidebook
for meeting the parents says

83
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,839
that during the first visit,

84
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,160
the boy's supposed to help
with the household chores.

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,399
You clean the table

86
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,559
and mop the floor, then.

87
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,240
I'd like to do the chores with you.

88
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,880
Do you honestly think
I want to wash the dishes?

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,160
My mom just wants

90
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,039
to have a girl-to-girl talk with me.

91
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,039
Stay out of it.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,520
Mom.

93
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,720
Come on, let me help you.

94
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
No, no. Don't get your hands dirty.

95
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,119
It's dirty. It's dirty.

96
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,919
It's dirty. It's dirty.

97
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,559
I'm sure you're tired.

98
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,800
No, no. Honestly.

99
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,919
What about this?
You don't touch them.

100
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,240
Later,

101
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,279
your dad is going to wash them.

102
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,000
Qingyuan,

103
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,720
play game with me.

104
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,720
Fine.

105
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,559
But I'll clean up the table first.

106
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,479
Okay.

107
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,559
I wonder where Tang Xin

108
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,759
learned how to tame the boyfriend.

109
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,039
Amazing.

110
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,160
Left. Left.

111
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,759
Left, Qingyuan.

112
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,279
On the left.

113
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,919
You see that?

114
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,639
On the hill.

115
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,440
At the position of 345.

116
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,639
He's hiding in the bushes.

117
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,480
Right. Shoot him, shoot him.

118
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,839
Shoot him, shoot him. Quickly.

119
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,600
Run, run, run.

120
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,359
He's coming.

121
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,040
Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him.

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,799
I hit him.

123
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,040
Just give him a lethal shot.

124
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,640
A lethal shot. Yeah, yeah.

125
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,279
I'll bomb him.

126
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:31,839
Again.

127
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
Died again, Qingyuan.

128
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,760
Qingyuan, I died again.

129
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,559
You're on your own.

130
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,079
Qingyuan, I get it.

131
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,799
It's not that you have talent
in shooting.

132
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,480
You're just a fast learner.

133
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,320
I think

134
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,279
you can spend more time
on mobile games

135
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,600
when you're free.

136
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,200
They're great.

137
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,799
They help with stress and depression.

138
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,000
I won.

139
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,399
Awesome.

140
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,679
Five kills.

141
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,799
Nice work.

142
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,799
When you're back in Haiya,

143
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,799
we'll play the game together.

144
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,160
I'll carry you to the rank of Super Ace.

145
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,880
Scheduled.

146
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
No problem.

147
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,200
Shen.

148
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,559
Let's talk.

149
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,720
No, no. Don't get up.

150
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,799
You will be with your parents
on the Spring Festival's Eve?

151
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,279
They are abroad.

152
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,559
Then how about you and Tang Xin

153
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,200
celebrate it at home with us?

154
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,519
In the future,

155
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,359
whether it's a festival or not,

156
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,559
you're always welcome

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,079
to come.

158
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,679
Just treat us as your own family.

159
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,519
Okay.

160
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,600
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

161
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,839
Dad.

162
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,200
Thank you, Dad.

163
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,320
That's right.

164
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
My daughter,

165
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,440
I bet you've learned
everything about life

166
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,279
now that you're
having an independent life.

167
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,720
Look at you,

168
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,079
my poor girl.

169
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,679
Not everything.

170
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:02,200
Alright.

171
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,239
I haven't

172
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,640
taken a good look at you.

173
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,600
Let me check.

174
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,839
You've got a little bit chubbier.

175
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,920
Oh, I remember.

176
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,519
The last time we went
to shoe-shopping was a year ago.

177
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
You're wearing old shoes, right?

178
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,000
No.

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,760
Shen Qingyuan bought these for me.

180
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,480
They're really fit.

181
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,040
Look.

182
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,239
Really?

183
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
Is he nice to you?

184
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:28,959
Very nice.

185
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,920
Glad to know.

186
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,760
And listen.

187
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Are you living together?

188
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,279
Um…

189
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,040
Um what?

190
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,320
Still hiding from me?

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,799
I'm not an old-fashioned mother.

192
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,079
It's okay that you're living together.

193
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,720
But I tell you what.

194
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,760
You'd better keep an eye out.

195
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,920
You mustn't be careless.

196
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,880
Do you hear me?

197
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,040
And I know you're soft-hearted.

198
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,079
So you mustn't be obedient.

199
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't act like a good girl.

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,559
Because after you're married,

201
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,279
the husband

202
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,920
doesn't really care
about the wife anymore.

203
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,880
You hear me?

204
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,839
I got it, Mom.

205
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,519
But seriously.

206
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,359
I won't be staying at home

207
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,600
long this time.

208
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,239
We may

209
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,880
head back to Haiya tomorrow.

210
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,839
Unbelievable,

211
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,559
you just came home for one dinner?

212
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Listen, Mom.

213
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't feel bad.

214
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,720
When Shen Qingyuan and I

215
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,959
are settled in that city,

216
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,600
you're welcome to enjoy
your retirement over there.

217
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,079
Okay.

218
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,839
Remember.

219
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,720
Take good care of yourself out there.

220
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,559
Come on, let me hug you.

221
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,600
We haven't hugged for ages.

222
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,679
Won't you stay for a few more days?

223
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,079
You old fool,
our daughter is an adult now.

224
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,480
Dad, Mom,

225
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,760
we're off.

226
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,239
Come.

227
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,279
Take care.

228
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,640
Be safe.

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,760
Bye.

230
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,079
Bye, Mom.

231
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,679
Bye, Mr. Tang.

232
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,079
Bye.

233
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:16,880
Dad.

234
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,079
Attaboy.

235
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,519
Be safe, you two.

236
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,679
See you. Bye-bye.

237
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,839
Safe travels.

238
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,959
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

239
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,200
How do you feel?

240
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
Our mom and dad are nice.

241
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,679
Still Mom and Dad?

242
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,080
Yeah.

243
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,239
I'm a man

244
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,440
of consistency.

245
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,359
I deserve a reward, don't you think?

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
Why did you poke my face?

247
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,000
You've finished your mission.

248
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,479
Do you really need a stamp on the pork?

249
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,760
Of course, I do.

250
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,520
Wait, what pork?

251
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:04,880
Hello?

252
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,559
Pretty good.

253
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,479
She is with me.

254
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,039
Dad wants to talk to you.

255
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,200
We just left.

256
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,080
What's this phone call about?

257
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,840
Hello, Dad.

258
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm happy

259
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
that you call me this way.

260
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,479
Mr. Shen.

261
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,919
No need to change it.

262
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
That's pretty good.

263
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,880
Tang Xin,

264
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,960
I need to talk to you.

265
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,840
I will soon

266
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,919
have an emergency meeting,

267
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,239
and I can't really leave.

268
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,559
Qingyuan's mother

269
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,479
is up to her neck

270
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,559
as well.

271
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,719
You may need to take care of Qingyuan

272
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,960
for a bit longer.

273
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,559
You know

274
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,479
the foreign holidays

275
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,919
are different from ours.

276
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,280
Now is

277
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,440
the busiest season here.

278
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,799
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

279
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
I'll take good care of him.

280
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
Thank you.

281
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,599
That's it.

282
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,640
His mother and I will rush back home

283
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
as soon as the peak season is over.

284
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,640
By then,

285
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,280
the first thing is
that we meet each other, okay?

286
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,000
Sure, Mr. Shen.

287
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
Tang Xin,

288
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,520
you two be good.

289
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,000
Bye, Mr. Shen.

290
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,799
Bye.

291
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,559
How...

292
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,280
do you feel?

293
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,599
Dad is pretty nice.

294
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,239
Tang Xin,

295
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,559
I remember you told me

296
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,479
about the 99%

297
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,320
and 1%.

298
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,039
I used to think

299
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,239
that I could

300
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,280
deal with 99%

301
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,280
of the daily life

302
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,080
like I was solving problems,

303
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,080
or that I could deal
with them without care.

304
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,080
Maybe at the time,

305
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,919
I always tended

306
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,599
to place myself
at the center of a circle,

307
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,599
the 1% part,

308
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,200
to observe the world.

309
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,479
But after I came to Yongcheng with you,

310
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,200
I felt like

311
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,359
once I relieve myself of the stress,

312
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,200
and walk out of the center of the circle

313
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,039
to embrace life,

314
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,039
the 99%

315
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,479
can be dealt with in better ways,

316
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,960
and the small things in life

317
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,559
are worth being cherished.

318
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,719
The 99%

319
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,559
isn't the target

320
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,880
that needs to be dealt with,

321
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,960
but the motivation

322
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,280
for the 1%.

323
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,559
Are you ready

324
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,919
for the 1% now?

325
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,280
I am.

326
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,559
Let's go home.

327
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:30,400
Mr. Zhang.

328
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,640
Hello. Hi.

329
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,359
I'm Xu Dian.

330
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,200
Here's the thing.

331
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,200
Your winter training

332
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,280
will soon be over, right?

333
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,039
We're going to shoot the ending part.

334
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,119
It is a shame

336
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,039
that Shen Qingyuan isn't on the team.

337
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
But other shooters

338
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,960
also deserve the attention, right?

339
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,400
Okay, okay. Sure.

340
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,479
See you around.

341
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,599
Later.

342
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,120
(How Far Can Haiya Shooting Team Go
After Losing Shen Qingyuan?)

343
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,559
The holidays were so short.

344
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,799
They were over in the blink of an eye.

345
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,039
Tell me about it.

346
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,119
I wonder how Captain Shen is doing.

347
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,559
Without Captain Shen,

348
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,159
I always feel like
we're missing something.

349
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,599
Oh, right.

350
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,599
Xu Dian is coming again

351
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,039
to shoot the ending part
of the winter training.

352
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,599
Xu Dian is coming again?

353
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:26,679
Fine.

354
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
We'll sort him out

355
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,679
along with Zhou Yue.

356
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,159
We'll smack them in their faces
with our good scores.

357
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,359
They're here.

358
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:38,880
Zhou,

359
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,200
I was just about to interview you.

360
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,440
You go set the cameras.

361
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,719
You two, prepare the interview.

362
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,679
Zhou Yue.

363
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,440
Ever since Shen Qingyuan left

364
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,719
the winter training base,

365
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,719
you've been the first place.

366
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,719
So the voices online

367
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,840
regard you

368
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
as the most promising shooter.

369
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,960
How do you respond to that?

370
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,880
I'm overrated.

371
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,400
You know, I feel sorry

372
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,039
that Shen Qingyuan left.

373
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
But it can't be helped

374
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,280
because it's a psychological problem.

375
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,719
He just

376
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,679
cannot be a shooter anymore.

377
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,960
So I wish

378
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,080
him to do well

379
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,479
in other territories.

380
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,200
I, however, only wish to do well

381
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,599
in competitions.

382
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,880
Captain Shen!

383
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
- Captain!
- Captain Shen!

384
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,200
Captain Shen!

385
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,039
Make way.

386
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,840
Let me through.

387
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,479
- Captain.
- Captain Shen,

388
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,440
catching people off guard

389
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,559
is your thing, huh?

390
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,640
Why didn't you two

391
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,799
give us a notice about your return?

392
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,559
- Right.
- Yeah.

393
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,200
Shen Qingyuan,

394
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,400
you look good.

395
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,960
Captain Shen, you came back at last.

396
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,119
If you didn't,

397
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,479
I would get another partner.

398
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,599
Yeah, I'm back.

399
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,320
Captain,

400
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,479
lead us to the training.

401
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:50,640
Hai.

402
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,919
What are you talking about?

403
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,479
Yeah.

404
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,280
We need to hold some kind of a

405
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,200
welcome ceremony.

406
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,119
Right.

407
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,719
But we

408
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:56,840
didn't make any preparation.

409
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,559
Hey, that's not cool.

410
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,840
Wait, let me think.

411
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Acting too carefully

412
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
actually makes him stressed.

413
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,960
It's fine.

414
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,719
How about we…

415
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,320
It's only been a few days.

416
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,119
Have you forgotten

417
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:12,799
all about my temperament?

418
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,280
Captain,

419
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
what is your temperament?

420
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,880
Yeah.

421
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,280
You're so boring.

422
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:18,440
But Captain Shen,

423
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,599
you suddenly returned,

424
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,440
we're missing something.

425
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,200
What thing?

426
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,799
Your comeback gift.

427
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,840
I'll sort it out for you right away.

428
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,359
Way to go, Boss Du.

429
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,200
Cool.

430
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
No matter how many difficulties
I have to go through

431
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,799
or how many obstacles
I need to overcome,

432
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,880
I'll always aim for the Olympics.

433
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,039
Sorry

434
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,640
that I let you down.

435
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,480
(Armed Transport Keep Distance)

436
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,479
Be careful.

437
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,799
These are expensive.

438
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:18,640
Got it.

439
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,400
(Yang Xiaoling)

440
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,760
(Shen Qingyuan)

441
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
(Shen Qingyuan)

442
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,320
Don't worry, Coach.

443
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,400
Shen Qingyuan is fine.

444
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,760
If anything isn't fine,

445
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,000
it's his crappy gun.

446
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,520
Oh, right, Coach.

447
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
You know I'm going

448
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,760
to open a shooting club, right?

449
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,559
I purchased some new guns,

450
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,039
and I've also

451
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,400
got an upgrade for Captain Shen.

452
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,440
The gun was delivered this day.

453
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,400
(Shen Qingyuan)

454
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,960
Bro,

455
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,440
need any help?

456
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,320
No.

457
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,719
Only the staff can touch these.

458
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm Zhou Yue, Captain
of Southeast Team.

459
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,280
Look.

460
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,599
I know the warehouse manager here

461
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,000
is bad-tempered.

462
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,119
And he always yells at you, right?

463
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,520
You've been

464
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,640
moving the boxes for some time.

465
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,479
It's pretty tiring, right?

466
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,840
I'll give you a hand.

467
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,159
You take a break,

468
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,679
and you get to see
that stinker less, right?

469
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,880
Fine.

470
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,799
You need to be careful, though.

471
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,280
Those are Haiya guns.

472
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
If anything happens,

473
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,719
we'll be responsible.

474
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,880
Don't worry. I got it.

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,960
Okay. I appreciate it.

476
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,640
Thank you.

477
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Shen Qingyuan,

478
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,439
without your gun,

479
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,640
let's see how you'll do well.

480
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,800
What are you doing?

481
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,920
Shen Qingyuan, you're so dirty,

482
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,520
aren't you?

483
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:33,880
Coach,

484
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
they set up the snare

485
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
for me to step in.

486
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,520
I…

487
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,640
You what?

488
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
You've disappointed me!

489
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:41,959
Liu,

490
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,479
you do what you have to do.

491
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,800
Look what you've done.

492
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,079
Give me that.

493
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,920
Alright, alright.

494
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,439
Get on the bus. Get on the bus.

495
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,560
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

496
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,359
Give me the bag.

497
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,160
Will you?

498
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,400
You have three seconds.

499
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:15,880
Quickly.

500
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,520
- Let's go.
- Be quick.

501
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,119
Jiang Yitian.

502
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,520
You had it coming.

503
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,839
Attention. Attention.

504
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,800
Team leaders, coaches,

505
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,199
and athletes.

506
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,959
Here's an announcement.

507
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,520
Zhou Yue from Southeast Team

508
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,239
has been suspended for a year

509
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,479
due to his violation of the regulations.

510
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,520
- He's really suspended.
- I repeat.

511
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,000
Listen.

512
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,319
Zhou Yue from Southeast Team

513
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,760
has been suspended for a year

514
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,079
due to his violation of the regulations.

515
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,280
Get on the bus.

516
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,199
Wait, let me put it in there.

517
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,199
Put it in there.

518
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,119
So it's sorted just like that?

519
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,719
Yeah.

520
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,280
I've been investigating him
for a long time,

521
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,479
but I never got anything on him.

522
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,119
I had no choice

523
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,599
but to wait for him to expose himself.

524
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:06,959
Obviously,

525
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,640
he was driven mad by jealousy.

526
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,359
That's kind of

527
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,520
unethical, don't you think?

528
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,439
They're the indecent ones.

529
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,520
Even if we didn't do this,

530
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,599
they'd be caught sooner or later.

531
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,079
Got it?

532
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,680
And look,

533
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,280
even if he hadn't done this,

534
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,839
they'd be in other trouble.

535
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,520
Why?

536
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,959
Because they're dishonorable.

537
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,160
Karma will find them.

538
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,000
Right?

539
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:34,920
Nice job.

540
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,880
He has a vile heart.

541
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,000
His eyes are evasive.

542
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,319
You look at me, I look at you.

543
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,359
The formalities are excessive.

544
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,160
Don't be hasty or you'll fall.

545
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,239
You should watch over me.

546
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,640
We're back at last.

547
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,359
Help me get

548
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,359
that yellow luggage case.

549
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,239
Mine is the one inside.

550
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Come on. Gather around, everyone.

551
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,439
How do you feel to be back?

552
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,000
- Good.
- Great.

553
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,359
We'll keep training tomorrow.

554
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,959
Go home and get some rest.

555
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,199
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

556
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,920
- Bye, Coach.
- Bye, Coach.

557
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,479
I'll see her together with you.

558
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,520
Let's dine together.

559
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,680
Dine together?

560
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,520
Okay, okay.

561
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,599
- We'll join you.
- Us, too.

562
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,000
Let's go together.

563
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,520
Yeah, together.

564
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,760
Me too.

565
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,319
(No.2 Canteen)
I have to say

566
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,760
that our campus canteen makes

567
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,439
great food.

568
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,560
It still can't compete with
home cooking.

569
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,640
What?

570
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,719
Are you trying

571
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,719
to turn me and Xiaoci
against each other?

572
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,000
I warn you...

573
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,560
Enough.

574
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,719
Let's talk business.

575
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,079
As planned previously,

576
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,839
I should be processing

577
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,839
my quit from now on.

578
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,199
So please

579
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,040
cherish the final days with me.

580
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,560
When will you leave?

581
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,040
Normally, the process

582
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,479
takes about a week.

583
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
We'll miss you.

584
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,280
(All Photos)

585
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,479
I forgot about the short video.

586
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,239
I hope I can finish it in time.

587
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,680
Tang Xin,

588
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,199
if you have a minute,

589
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,079
please come to see me
in the Counseling Room.

590
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,079
Coach, Dr. Ding.

591
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,280
Hi, Tang Xin.

592
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,599
Sit.

593
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:21,839
Tang Xin,

594
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,839
although Shen Qingyuan has returned
to the team,

595
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,520
Coach Zhang

596
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,959
is still pretty concerned.

597
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,119
He didn't want to interfere
with his winter training,

598
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,920
so he never let it out.

599
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,839
Now that he's back in the university,

600
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,800
we'd like to learn

601
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,439
if Shen Qingyuan is willing

602
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,640
to take the follow-up treatment.

603
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
After all, he hasn't

604
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,319
got his entire memory back yet.

605
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:42,400
What if

606
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,880
he suddenly runs away again?

607
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,199
Let's learn his state

608
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,439
from Tang Xin first.

609
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,400
Ever since he recovered
from the outbreak,

610
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,479
I haven't noticed
anything abnormal about him.

611
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,439
Has he shown any sign

612
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,160
of remembering anything?

613
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,560
When will you

614
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,719
tell him

615
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,520
about the official
clinical psychotherapy?

616
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,359
Dr. Ding,

617
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,760
is there an adjuvant

618
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,880
treatment method?

619
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,000
Although

620
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,359
he seems normal at the moment,

621
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,160
(Schedule of Trial for National Training Team)
I'm worried that…

622
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,479
When it comes to a patient

623
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,880
like Shen Qingyuan,

624
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,079
before he retrieves

625
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,040
and accepts his memory about the past,

626
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,719
uncertainties always exist.

627
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,800
So I can't

628
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,160
make a diagnosis

629
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
before he takes the psychotherapy.

630
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,239
I'm worried that I may provoke him

631
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,760
by mentioning psychotherapy.

632
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,880
Tang Xin,

633
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,479
we don't have time.

634
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,839
It's only one month

635
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,040
before the trial for the national team.

636
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,760
If he can't be selected,

637
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,880
he'll never get another chance
to participate in the Olympics.

638
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,439
So Shen Qingyuan…

639
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,239
I haven't signed him up yet.

640
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,839
If he isn't in the best state,

641
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,640
he'll only squander the opportunity.

642
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
Coach Zhang, trust me.

643
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,520
I understand our priority

644
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,479
is that he

645
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,719
participates in the games.

646
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,680
Tang Xin,

647
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,280
too much concern brings trouble.

648
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,239
You saw

649
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,719
the worst situation of his,

650
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,079
so I'm sure you understand

651
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,079
the importance of psychotherapy.

652
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,400
Dr. Ding,

653
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,959
I know what you mean.

654
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,400
May I find

655
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,239
a better time to talk to him?

656
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,400
I understand your concern.

657
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,520
And maybe

658
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
it'll even slow down his recovery.

659
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,199
But postponement

660
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,800
will only lead to more uncertainties.

661
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,239
I'll leave you to your conversation.

662
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,760
Don't worry, Coach Zhang.

663
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,880
(Rule for Olympic Winter Games Shooting
(Air Pistol) Individual Game Athlete Selection)

664
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,079
This is the detailed rule
for the national team to select athletes.

665
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,439
Have a look.

666
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,839
I know that you aim

667
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,640
for the Olympics,

668
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,280
but you won't have a chance

669
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,199
unless you get into the national team.

670
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,839
So your time

671
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,640
is short.

672
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,359
You need to get your game state back.

673
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,319
I understand.

674
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,359
Shen,

675
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,760
I'm not trying to put pressure on you.

676
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,319
As a shooter,

677
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,199
you should know

678
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,520
that there's no turning back

679
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,599
for a shot-out bullet.

680
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,640
So before you shoot,

681
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,479
make sure you have no regret.

682
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,280
Every shot has to be confident.

683
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,439
Looking back at your past

684
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,319
requires courage.

685
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,040
But it will grant you power, too.

686
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,599
In a sense,

687
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,560
Shen Qingyuan is lucky.

688
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
Because he has got you.

689
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,160
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

690
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,560
Dr. Ding,

691
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,199
you said you wanted

692
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:39,880
to write a book about

693
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,000
athletes' mental health.

694
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,880
May I help you with it?

695
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,760
How?

696
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,160
You'd like

697
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,439
to share the story
between you and Shen Qingyuan?

698
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,520
This is what I have in mind for now.

699
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,680
But I haven't asked for his opinion.

700
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,880
If I'm given the permission,

701
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,280
I'd like to share our true story

702
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,280
so that more of those in need

703
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,400
can see it.

704
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,119
It's a form of consolation, at least.

705
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,079
Thank you for your goodwill,

706
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:01,680
Tang Xin.

707
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,400
I also would like

708
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,959
to make a series of videos

709
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:04,800
and post them online.

710
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,439
And when your book is published,

711
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,959
I think they will

712
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,199
reach more people in need.

713
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,160
Good idea.

714
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,319
She's the one you've been expecting?

715
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,160
Tang Xin,

716
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,239
sit.

717
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,359
Thank you.

718
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,520
Want some drink?

719
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,439
No.

720
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's put the past aside

721
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,479
for now.

722
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,959
Ai,

723
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,760
after all,

724
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
I came to ask you for a favor.

725
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,800
And this thing

726
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,839
is related to Tang Xin.

727
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Shall we begin?

728
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,359
Okay.

729
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,319
The one from Tonight Show?

730
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,439
Yes.

731
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,280
Xu Dian is a habitual criminal.

732
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,520
To him,

733
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,280
all beautiful young girls

734
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:25,760
are his prey.

735
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,520
Or his toys

736
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,640
that have no value.

737
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,160
And you're not the only one

738
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,520
who was harmed.

739
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,680
I'll give you an example.

740
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,520
A few years back

741
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,000
when I still worked in the TV station,

742
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,359
I was in charge of several programs

743
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,319
on the sports channel.

744
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,520
At the time, I brought up
a female presenter.

745
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Who was like you,

746
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,319
studious, diligent,

747
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,520
and got potential.

748
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,400
But on the day before

749
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,359
a livestream program was on air,

750
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,000
she suddenly quit her job.

751
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,359
She walked away
without leaving a word.

752
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,239
No matter how hard
I tried to contact her,

753
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,640
she wouldn't see me.

754
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,319
I always thought

755
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,119
I'd done something wrong,

756
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,160
or maybe

757
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,439
I'd put my faith in the wrong person.

758
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,959
The program experienced a crisis,

759
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,800
and I was accountable for it.

760
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,520
So I had been demoted

761
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,359
to Rui Live.

762
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,000
I never knew that.

763
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's not important.

764
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,239
It wasn't until I met Xu Dian

765
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,280
at the winter training

766
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,160
did I figure it

767
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,000
all out.

768
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,680
She left the TV station

769
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,000
out of anger

770
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
because Xu Dian committed
sexual harassment on her.

771
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,479
So Ai,

772
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,400
do not trust Xu Dian anymore.

773
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,760
He won't

774
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,719
fulfill any compromise that he made.

775
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,959
I know.

776
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,479
Because Tonight Show

777
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,400
is what

778
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,319
he promised me.

779
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,439
You're lucky.

780
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,000
I always believe that you fight

781
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,319
to earn everything in life.

782
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,319
You think I don't believe so?

783
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,520
You think I was like this

784
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,719
from the beginning?

785
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,680
You met Zhou Zuguang

786
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,479
while I met Xu Dian.

787
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,000
This is the most unfair part.

788
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:32,520
Do you know

789
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,199
how it feels

790
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,359
to fight against

791
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,439
Xu Dian's harassment on my own?

792
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,199
It almost feels like
I don't have a future anymore.

793
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,640
No one would listen to me

794
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,000
or trust me

795
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,640
or even remember me.

796
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,680
He'll never get off my back.

797
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,400
If you only have two choices,

798
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,359
reject him

799
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,119
and go home,

800
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:17,000
or accept it

801
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,599
in exchange of a chance to climb up,

802
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,439
what would you choose?

803
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,000
But he's lying to you.

804
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,760
You think
you're the only smart one, huh?

805
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,000
Now that I've taken the path,

806
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,000
even though I know,
I have to pretend that I don't.

807
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,839
Do you understand?

808
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,520
There's no way back for me.

809
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,280
But now you

810
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,520
still have another choice.

811
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,520
Ai,

812
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,000
you're a smart girl.

813
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
I believe you take precautions

814
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
while you're with Xu Dian,

815
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,119
right?

816
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
Or else you wouldn't have come here.

817
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,319
This is all I have.

818
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,920
The recommendation letter
that you promised me,

819
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,079
don't you forget that.

820
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,400
No problem.

821
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,680
That's a nice city.

822
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,439
You'll have a nice life there.

823
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,680
It's none of your concern.

824
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:52,920
I'm home.

825
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,000
Welcome home.

826
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,000
Put the slippers on.

827
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,800
I got them ready for you.

828
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:06,959
And him.

829
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,400
He welcomes your return, too.

830
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,880
I never thought one day,

831
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,479
I'd have two of my lovers on both sides.

832
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,199
Just me, please.

833
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,560
Well done, Shen Qingyuan.

834
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,199
Your praise

835
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,599
sounds insincere.

836
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,319
Insincere how?

837
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,640
This is a praise

838
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,719
full of passion and sincerity.

839
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,359
Shen Qingyuan,

840
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,439
you want the praise

841
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,880
in the form of material, right?

842
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
So to an athlete,

843
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,160
is the praise in the form of material

844
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,880
a gold medal?

845
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,560
To be precise,

846
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,719
yes, a gold medal,

847
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,719
and you.

848
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,679
I haven't signed him up yet.

849
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,239
If he isn't in the best state,

850
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,239
he'll only squander the opportunity.

851
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,879
I bought you a gift.

852
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,760
It'll soon arrive.

853
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,399
I'll go change to something comfortable.

854
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,199
How come

855
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,760
I put on Shen Qingyuan's T-shirt?

856
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,239
Never mind. I'll keep it on.

857
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,199
I'll go change it in my bedroom.

858
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,600
Tang Xin,

859
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:45,080
the noodles are ready.

860
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:50,879
Let it cool down.

861
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
I'll have it when it's less hot.

862
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You eat noodles when it's hot,

863
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,639
right?

864
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,080
I'm not wearing a suitable T-shirt.

865
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,239
I'll go change it.

866
00:35:59,239 --> 00:35:59,760
No.

867
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,520
It suits you perfectly.

868
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,000
Is it good?

869
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,399
I give you this.

870
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:24,560
Good to know.

871
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,159
Won't you eat some?

872
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:31,800
I've had some.

873
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,120
I'll just watch.

874
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,239
Look at you.

875
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,679
You're so careless.

876
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:49,879
Shen Qingyuan,

877
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:50,879
I think we'd better

878
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,080
dine together.

879
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,080
Why?

880
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,760
Because you keep disturbing me

881
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,199
when you're not eating.

882
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,399
The gift has arrived.

883
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,520
Don't go.

884
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,520
I'll go get it.

885
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,560
Why?

886
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Your T-shirt is not suitable.

887
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,959
You just said it suited me perfectly.

888
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,639
Because only I'm the only one
who gets to see you.

889
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:31,879
It's for you.

890
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,600
It's a bit childish, isn't it?

891
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,159
Forget it, then.

892
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,120
I love childish stuff.

893
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,959
Actually, I bought one for myself, too.

894
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:47,080
With a doll on it.

895
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,399
So not only did the doll and the bear

896
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,080
dance together,

897
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
but they also…

898
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,000
Shen Qingyuan,

899
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,840
you're unbelievable.

900
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:02,679
I said nothing.

901
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,800
Actually,

902
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,719
you are right.

903
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,800
What I mean is,

904
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,719
if you accept the pillow,

905
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,719
maybe

906
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:19,159
we can go to my room and…

907
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:20,919
Come on, then.

908
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:22,560
Wait. Wait a minute.

909
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:23,760
You just said

910
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,679
it was a childish pillow

911
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,560
and that you didn't want it.

912
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,959
I said,

913
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,239
I love childish stuff.

914
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,600
And this pillow

915
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,600
is the warmest pillow in the world.

916
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,800
Oh, right, Shen Qingyuan.

917
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,520
I'd like to

918
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,479
discuss something with you.

919
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,040
What?

920
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,360
Can our story

921
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,840
go public in the future?

922
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,320
Yours, mine.

923
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,879
Ours.

924
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,239
Why?

925
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,159
Though I'm not sure,

926
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,479
I hope it will be helpful

927
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:33,280
for those who had similar experiences.

928
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,080
