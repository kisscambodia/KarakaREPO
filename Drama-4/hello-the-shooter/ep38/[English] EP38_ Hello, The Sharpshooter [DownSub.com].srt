00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,760
Xu Dian has left Zhengdao Media.

37
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,000
Really?

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,680
Let me have a look.

Speaking of which,

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,440
the photo looks quite real.

41
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,360
He kept such a low profile when he left.

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
He didn't even make an announcement.

43
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,160
He's the big-name anchor

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,639
who did the joint live broadcast of

45
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,239

46
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,760
Where is he going afterwards?

47

Maybe

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
he's about to go solo.

My goodness.

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,519
A statement just released
by Zhengdao Media on its Weibo account.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,559
Xu Dian, anchor of our company,

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,160
took advantage of his position

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,639
to sexually harass a female colleague.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The accusation
has been confirmed lately.

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,080
It is hereby announced that

56
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,720
Xu will be dismissed

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,440
and never be hired again.

58
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,360
This news indeed

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,559
comes as a bombshell.

60
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,720
In this case,

61
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,919

even said it takes two to tango.

65

66
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,320

00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,239
Du Lingfeng, Du Lingfeng,

195
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,440
I did fortune-telling for you.

196
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,839
I'm sure
you'll be a billionaire in the future.

197
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,239
- Billionaire!
- Billionaire!

198
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,079
Why

199
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,399
did you steal a glance at me just now?

200
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,279
I didn't.

201
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,239
What are you talking about?

202
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,119
Just glance at me if you want.

203
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,320
Don't be shy.

204
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,959
Miss Tang,

205
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,160
we haven't finished recording yet.

206
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,559
Go ahead with the recording first.

207
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,959
Let's go on. Let's go on.

208
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,920
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Come on, come on.

209
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Hai, Hai.

210
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,279
Don't forget me if you get rich one day.

211
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,359
- Hai! Hai!
- Hai!

212
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,720
Come on. Let's do it together.

213
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,559
- Du Lingfeng, Mr. Du!
- Du Lingfeng!

214
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,480
- We love you!
- We love you!

215
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,839
It's my work time now.

216
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I have patients coming to visit later.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,640
Ding Fang,

218
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,239
I think I am a patient.

219
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
I have a strong feeling of inferiority.

220
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,640
My self-esteem gets in the way,

221
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,359
no...

222
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
My vanity gets in the way.

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,960
As you know,

224
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,320
I had a rough patch

225
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,239
at the TV station a few years back

226
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,640
and everything was going wrong.

227
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,919
At that time,

228
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,119
when I looked at myself every day,

229
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,919
I looked more and more
like an odious old man.

230
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,320
But you are always so glamorous

231
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,320
as if you haven't changed much

232
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,640
ever since I got to know you

233
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,200
from college till now.

234
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,840
You are only becoming more mature,

235
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
more intellectual

236
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,520
and more outstanding.

237
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,960
Is this really what you think?

238
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,400
Zhou Zuguang,

239
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,520
actually, there was also a time

240
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,440
when I worshipped you as a totem.

241
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,119
At that time,

242
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,799
in order to keep up with you,

243
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,919
I was pushing myself

244
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,760
to become mature day by day.

245
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,359
Later I did it.

246
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,039
But my totem

247
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,359
faded away.

248
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,159
I'm sorry I let you down.

249
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,599
Forget it.

250
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,919
It's all in the past.

251
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,239
Yes.

252
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,200
It's all in the past.

253
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,200
That makes two of us.

254
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,760
To be honest,

255
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,400
every time I faced

256
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,799
your well-reasoned analysis,

257
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,960
I was under a lot of pressure.

258
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
Seeing your career thriving

259
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,159
and you becoming a star psychologist

260
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,719
and a darling on social media,

261
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,799
I was jealous

262
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,159
and not willing to be outdone.

263
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,679
I did a lot of things

264
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,679
to try to keep up with you

265
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,919
or at least to keep abreast with you,

266
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,039
but it seemed the more I struggled,

267
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,159
the more things backfired.

268
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,880
All these things seemed to…

269
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,000
Seemed to be in vain.

270
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,479
I felt

271
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,200
I was no longer good enough for you.

272
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,119
It surprises me that

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,719
we both wanted to be closer
to each other.

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,119
But we ended up drifting apart.

275
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,239
Today

276
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,840
I get these things off my chest

277
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
and feel much more relieved.

278
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,159
For better or worse,

279
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,359
I think I have the duty

280
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,119
to tell you frankly

281
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:25,960
what I've been through mentally

282
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
during this period of time.

283
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,239
I…

284
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,640
I want to say

285
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,320
whether to patch up or get a divorce,

286
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,679
the choice is yours.

287
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,359
I'll think it over.

288
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,280
I'm going then.

289
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,400
Have you watched the video?

290
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:17,960
Yes.

291
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,599
What do you think of it?

292
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,200
I posted it too hastily.

293
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,760
I should have shown you

294
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,960
the script beforehand.

295
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,479
I posted it so abruptly.

296
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
I keep worrying

297
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,679
I said something inappropriate.

298
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,080
Don't think nonsense.

299
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,559
I think you've put it very well

300
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,320
in the video.

301
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,520
That's good then.

302
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,559
Do you know?

303
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,479
Sometimes it occurs to me

304
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,400
it is so hard

305
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,080
to be

306
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,039
a healthy adult.

307
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,520
Shen Qingyuan,

308
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,919
sometimes

309
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,640
I'm eager to help you cure your trauma,

310
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,640
but I don't know…

311
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,559
Shen Qingyuan,

312
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,640
will you go to see Dr. Ding with me?

313
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,039
Are you keen to have me on therapy?

314
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,200
But

315
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,559
I also want you

316
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,080
to follow your own wish.

317
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,640
OK.

318
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:44,960
I promise you.

319
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,080
For the gold medal.

320
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,239
And for you.

321
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,600
(Qianyang26)

322
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,479
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

323
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,320
I've thought it through.

324
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,119
I'm not going back to the station.

325
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,080
Rui Live is my brainchild.

326
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,640
It has just developed

327
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,599
and I can't bear to leave it.

328
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,080
OK.

330
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Thank you for being so understanding.

331
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:36,960
Sure, sure.

332
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,680
Shen Qingyuan,

333
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,560
thank you for being willing to trust me.

334
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
(Doctor's Office)

335
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,079
Tang Xin,

336
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,920
Shen Qingyuan would like you

337
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,800
to be his safety island.

338
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,680
In trauma therapy, safety island

339
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,599
is usually

340
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,199
an imagined scenario

341
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,760
which helps a patient

342
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,439
to soothe and calm his mind

343
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,119
during the painful recovery process.

344
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,000
During the course of the therapy,

345
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,280
you may receive some stimulations

346
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,560
to your eyes.

347
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,719
But rest assured that

348
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,439
there will be no side effects.

349
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
It is the first time in my career

350
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,640
that I've seen a patient

351
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,839
decides to choose a specific person

352
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,520
as his safety island.

00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,760
is open for business!

384
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,160
Great!

385
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,959
- Great!
- Thank you, guys.

386
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,079
Thanks.

387
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,240
Great!

388
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,119
Thank you. Thank you.

389
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,040
Please. Please.

390
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,520
Thank you, guys.

391
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,239
Today

392
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,479
good things come in pairs.

393
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,239
As you all know,

394
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,680
Xiaoci and Qingyuan

395
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,719
have entered the national team.

396
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,119
For Qingyuan

397
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,479
it was a bumpy road to get selected,

398
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,000
but Xiaoci

399
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,760
got selected with excellent performance.

400
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:37,959
Of course

401
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,400
this is no big deal.

402
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,000
After all, there will be

403
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,920
selections for the Olympics afterwards.

404
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,640
Next, I'm going to announce

405
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,160
the biggest event today.

406
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,920
Congrats on the opening of business.

407
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,199
Congrats, Du Lingfeng.

408
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,800
Shen Qingyuan!

409
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,079
You made a sneak attack behind my back.

410
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,400
Who can give me

411
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,680
a sophisticated weapon?

412
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,280
Du Lingfeng,

413
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,079
take this.

414
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:05,760
Well, this…

415
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,839
Theirs is a bit cute.

416
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,760
You know nothing.

417
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,920
Yours is for physical attack.

418
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,119
Mine is for chemical attack.

Don't think of retiring so soon.

Yes, yes, Captain.

450

At least

451
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,319
in my 20-year career,

452
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,520
I must try my best to get my first gold.

453
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,400
Good job, good job.

454
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,359
I almost fell asleep while watching.

455
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,959
Fell asleep? Let me have a look.

456
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,719
Look, your eyes are red.

457
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,560
Aren't you in tears?

458
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,520
- Mr. Du is moved.
- He's so moved.

459
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,040
All right, all right.

460
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,439
Stop laughing.

461
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:35,880
Next,

462
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,280
I have an announcement to make.

463
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,439
First,

464
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,839
I've talked to

465
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,760
Mr. Zhang,

466
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,880
and I'm just letting you know

467
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:44,680
that I

468
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,920
will continue the sponsorship for

469
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,959
Haiya Shooting Team in the coming days.

470
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,839
- Great!
- Great!

471
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
- Great!
- Great!

472
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Is this it?

473
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,959
I'm your sponsor anyway.

474
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,239
If you don't express your gratitude,

475
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,280
beware of my withdrawal of investment.

476
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,040
Didn't you agree to be our bro?

477
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,479
Why do you become a sponsor instead?

478
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,000
OK, OK.

479
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,880
The sponsorship is obligatory,

480
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,719
OK?

481
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,119
Next thing.

482
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,800
Upon my return to Lingda this time,

483
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,880
I'll be in charge of

484
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,839
marketing of a new product.

485
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,319

486
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,280
in my position

487
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,239
is up to my performance this time.

488
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:15,640
Shen Qingyuan,

489
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,920
are you my bro or not?

490
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,400
What?

491
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,439
Just get straight to the point.

492
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,839
I want you to be the endorser.

493
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,719
Are you in or not?

494
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,319
It's a good thing, Captain.

495
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,079
It's a good thing.

496
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,079
Isn't it a good thing?

497
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,040
- Say yes. Say yes.
- Say yes. Say yes.

498
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,599
We are bros.

499
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:39,839
Let me tell you,

500
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,920
I've another piece of good news for you.

501
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,199
This time,

502
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,439
I contacted the Austria-based

503
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,319
Steyr company,

504
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,359
the one specialized in

505
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,400
manufacturing sports pistols.

506
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,839
It must be more familiar to you than me.

507
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,479
I'm going to

508
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,160
import a batch of pistols from them.

509
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,640
Their manager has been

510
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,959
following you with great interest.

511
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,560
This time they heard your pistol

512
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,599
had not been working very well,

513
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,280
so…

514
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,079
(Invitation)
Steyr World Gun Championship.

515
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,479
I know that competition.

516
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,040
It is a very mature

517
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,839
commercial event.

518
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,719
It's been held

519
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,880
a dozen times so far.

520
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,439
Many internationally renowned shooters

521
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,199
take part in it.

522
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Du Lingfeng

523
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,640
is quite something.

524
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,040
He moved the home field to China.

525
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:16,920
But we usually

526
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,719
set our eyes on honor

527
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,319
and rarely join such commercial events.

528
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,880
Why do you want to join this time?

529
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,280
This competition

530
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,400
has good contestants.

531
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,479
Bachchan.

532
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,880
The one

533
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,199
who broke the Asian record last year?

534
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,160
He's one of

535
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,920
the outstanding

536
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,839
new-generation foreign players.

537
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,760
Lee Jae In of South Korea.

538
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,400
A gathering of master hands.

539
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,199
It seems we'll really have to

540
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,280
meet them in the upcoming competition.

541
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,800
So I think this competition

542
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,839
is a very good

543
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:54,640
practicing opportunity.

544
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
This is a very good opportunity

545
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,560
for exchange and learning

546
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,680
before the Olympic tryouts.

547
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,119
You can also take this opportunity

548
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,319
to find your top shape.

549
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,319
I'll talk to the coaches

550
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:07,959
of the national team.

551
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,319
Hope they'll approve your entry.

552
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,160
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

553
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,839
But once you go,

554
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,199
you can't just take it as practice.

555
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,959
For this trial,

556
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,479
you must show your real skills

557
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,520
more than any big and small competitions

558
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,400
you've entered before,

559
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,079
as this competition

560
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,079
is closer to

561
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,160
a real international level.

562
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,640
Qingyuan,

563
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,599
your current performance

564
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,599
is slowly getting back on track,

565
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,280
but you are not yet in a stable form.

566
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,640
If you can really

567
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,959
surpass yourself this time,

568
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,479
I'm sure

569
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,800
you'll win the Olympic tryouts.

570
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,560
(World Gun Championship Invitation)

571
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,520
I see.

572
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,400
(WeChat Moment: The most romantic thing
I've fancied is we brush teeth together)

573
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,160
You are back.

574
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:13,959
You are back.

575
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,160
Here.

576
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,920
I've washed both towels today.

577
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,359
Smell them. Are they fragrant?

578
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,199
Yes.

579
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,680
I think so too.

580
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,479
You…

581
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,760
You…

582
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:46,000
What are you doing with your suitcase?

583
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,439
I'm going to Nanjiang.

584
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:55,839
Nanjiang?

585
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:57,719
Why are you going again?

586
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,560
For the World Gun Championship.

587
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,560
Why are you smiling?

588
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:08,199
Nothing.

589
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,359
I just thought

590
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,839
we also met again

591
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,199
in the city of Nanjiang.

592
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,920
You were in the middle of a competition,

593
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,160
and you said I'd distract you

594
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
and asked me to go.

595
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,400
I didn't expect now we…

596
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,520
The two of us

597
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,680
have a predestined bond with that city.

598
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,560
I'm leaving tomorrow.

599
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,400
I'm gonna stay for quite a few days.

600
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,560
Make sure you keep up the good work.

601
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,000
When you are away from home,

602
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,359
you must protect yourself out there.

603
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,400
Watch out for your safety.

604
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,280
Sleep and eat on time.

605
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,920
Remember to bring

606
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,599
the electric toothbrush I gave you.

607
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,439
Don't come into conflict with anybody.

608
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,119
All right.

609
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,880
I'll go with you.

610
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,040
(Qianyang26)

611
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,040
What are you doing here?

612
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,040
Which department?

613
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,560
Hello.

614
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,680
I'm from Rui Live.

615
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Isn't this a weekend?

616
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,079
Your department.

617
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,400
OK. Go.

618
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:04,000
Mr. Zhou?

619
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,920
Tang Xin?

620
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,120
Mr. Zhou,

621
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,080
this is for you.

622
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,520
It's warm to drink with water.

623
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,639
Work is important,

624
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,399
but health is more important.

625
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,639
Thank you. It's very nice of you.

626
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,000
Mr. Zhou,

627
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,479
why are you still at the company?

628
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,399
I have to keep an eye on
the hotspot topics on weekends.

629
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,919
By the way,

630
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,239
the video you made for Du Lingfeng

631
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,159
is very good.

632
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,560
It's very well received online now.

633
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,159
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

634
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,320
Mr. Zhou, it's like this.

635
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,520
Shen Qingyuan has received an invitation

636
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,080
to a big business competition.

637
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,600
It's scheduled for the next few days.

638
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:36,800
Do you think…?

639
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,159
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

640
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,760
What a golden time it is!

641
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Young people are on vacation

642
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,639
and lots of people
are watching livestreams, right?

643
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,159
How does this sound?

644
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,040
You are going this time.

645
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,800
On an official business trip.

646
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:49,600
Do a good job.

647
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,120
I see.

648
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,399
I'll go and prepare for it right away.

649
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:00,800
Dr. Ding,

650
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,399
Shen Qingyuan's condition

651
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,360
is getting more and more stable now.

652
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,639
Thank you for your help.

653
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,639
Thank you for

654
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,239
taking him back to Yongcheng last time.

655
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,439
That was

656
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,840
a very good exposure therapy

657
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,560
which makes the following therapy

658
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,600
so smooth.

659
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,000
Sometimes, I really envy you.

660
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,000
You are so rational

661
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,159
and well-organized in the work you do.

662
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,439
Without your help,

663
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,760
Shen Qingyuan and I

664
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,159
would probably still be

665
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,639
trudging through the mud now.

666
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
Since you've

667
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,280
both walked out of the shadow,

668
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,320
is it time for you guys

669
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,560
to tie the knot next?

670
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,399
Almost.

671
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,399
But there's also a promise

672
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:39,159
between us.

673
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,560
Sometimes

674
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,959
I really envy you young people

675
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,959
whose relationships
are simple and unencumbered,

676
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:55,120
unlike me.

677
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,000
Dr. Ding,

678
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,560
you are so enlightened that

679
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
you shouldn't be trapped

680
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,639
by relationships, aren't you?

681
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,479
Haven't you heard of the saying

682
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,919
"It's hard for doctors
to cure themselves"?

683
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,879
Even if I can see something through,

684
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,520
I still put it off again and again.

685
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,040
Somehow

686
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,959
I just can't make a decision

687
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:14,879
and speak my mind.

688
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,120
What's wrong?

689
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,360
Is anything the matter?

690
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,879
Mr. Zhou,

691
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,320
it took me and Shen Qingyuan

692
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,840
many years to meet

693
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,320
and well over half a year

694
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,280
to clear the air.

695
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:34,080
In retrospect,

696
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,040
I was just lacking

697
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,600
the courage
to face the reality honestly.

698
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,639
Sometimes without asking or talking,

699
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:42,080
we think by watching carefully

700
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,560
we'll be able to find the answer

701
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,360
without the knowledge of the other side.

702
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
But if

703
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
we end up with the wrong answer,

704
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,360
wouldn't it be

705
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,959
a prolonged drag

706
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,280
on each other?

707
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,439
Sorry, Mr. Zhou.

708
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,800
I even started talking about

709
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,919
my own understanding of relationship
in front of you.

710
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:02,520
It's OK.

711
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,639
You and Shen Qingyuan

712
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,280
got together

713
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,199
into a good union

714
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,879
under my watch.

715
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,800
You've eventually become a loving pair.

716
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,040
It's OK.

717
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,600
Well done.

718
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,919
Get on with your work.

719
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,040
Mr. Zhou, I'm going for now.

720
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,480
(Flight Information Beijing, China)

721
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,159
Thanks.

722
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,719
Shen Qingyuan.

723

(Haiya Linxi Airport Boarding Pass)

724
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,959
Shen Qingyuan,

725
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,360
you must thank

726
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Du Lingfeng profusely this time.

727
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,879
To make this competition happen,

728
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,879
he did both sponsoring and legwork.

729
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,000
It was really hard work.

730
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,439
What's more,

731
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,600
he contacted all the contestants

732
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,520
one by one

733
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,360
to invite them to come.

734
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,600
He did it to help you get back in form

735
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,840
and get familiar with others.

736
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,040
Don't lose steam.

737
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:57,120
I know.

738
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,080
Besides, I reckon by now
Free at kisskh.me

739
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,399
he's already arrived at the venue

740
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,959
and is keeping an eye on
all the arrangements.

741
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,800
The last time he was so motivated

742
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,479
was when he was courting Xiaoci.

743
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,479
So

744
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,360
since he sincerely takes you as his bro,

745
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,879
make sure you don't belittle him.

746
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,360
Now

747
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,959
he's reported to be a responsible,

748
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,080
enthusiastic entrepreneur

749
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,080
and an angel investor for athletes.

750
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,239
Plus his previous

751
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,560
professional image
with the shooting team,

752
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,479
now everybody says he is

753
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,520
a promising, outstanding young gun.

754
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,040
All right, all right, all right.

755
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:27,679
I've kept them in mind.

756
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,080
Enthusiastic entrepreneur.

757
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,199
Angel investor.

758
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,679
I've kept them all in mind.

759
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,239
Don't bring him up to me.

00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:42,760
Have you kept them all in mind?

762
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:45,919
Let's go.

763
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,960
Hello, is there anything you need?

764
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,920
No thanks.

765
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,439
What's up?

766
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,439
I'm afraid you'll feel cold.

767
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,280
I don't feel cold.

768
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
I haven't finished
sorting through the files.

769
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,639
Loosen your grip.

770
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,320
I feel cold.

771
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:18,800
Hello.

772
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,639
What can I do for you?

773
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,919
Please get me a blanket. Thanks.

774
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:21,679
OK. Just a moment, please.

775
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,399
Here you are.

776
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:30,959
Thanks.

777
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,120
Done.

778
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,399
Do you feel warm now?

779
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,919
Are you unhappy?

780
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,399
Shen Qingyuan,

781
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,840
do you still remember that

782
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,120
on the flight back

783
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,439
from Nanjiang, you said

784
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
the air around me was too fragrant

785
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,159
and asked Jiang Yitian

786
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,040
to swap seats with me.

787
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,000
Do you remember?

788
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,000
Yes.

789
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,159
I remember

790
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,479
the first time I saw you,

791
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,719
I began to have

792
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,919
a miraculous feeling.

793
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,800
I didn't know until later

794
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,000
that it was because I had

795
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,239
gazed into your eyes
so many times before

796
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,560
that I had that miraculous urge

797
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,800
to want to get close.

798
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,479
No wonder you kept
talking about pheromone.

799
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:39,919
It was not pheromone.

800
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,320
It was love.

801
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,719
Tang Xin,

802
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
I had never forgotten you.

803
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,399
I just locked

804
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,080
