Ms. Zhao?

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,389
Anna.

32
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,199
What a coincidence!

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,839
I didn't expect to meet you here.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,309
Do you come for dinner?

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,110
Yes. Do you want me to join?

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,160
Come on. Take a seat.

37
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,519
That will be great. I will join.

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,390
Come on.

39
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,629
Ms. Zhao, would you mind?

40
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,800
No. Just a meal.

41
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,520
Little Jiaxin.

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,630
Did you consider things that

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,280
I told you?

44
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,960
Jiangyue,<br>I will talk with Anna there for a while.

45
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,239
I'll be back soon.

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
Anna, let's talk over there.

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,240
Anna, about that...

48
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,629
I have to think about it more.

49
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,399
OK?

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,889

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,469
Bye.

55
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,070
Bye, Anna.

56
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm sorry, darling.

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,120
what's going on?

58
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,879
Why were you talking again?

59
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,959
What do you need to consider?

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,070
Just work.

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,039
She wants to cooperate with us.

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,990
We are still working on the details.

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,910
Come on, let's eat.

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,709
Are you angry?

65
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,319
No.

66
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,549
Let's have dinner.

67
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,320
I will order.

68

77
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,399
Hello.

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,629
Jingjing.

79
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,189
Will you be home tomorrow afternoon?

80
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,120
I've got something to ask you.

81
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,239
Come on.

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,829
This is the afternoon tea I've prepared.

83
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,269
What do you think?

84
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,910
Is it good?

85
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,069
Nice.

86
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,839
You can even make cakes.

87
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,559
What did Zhang Hao do to you?

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,559
You silly.

89
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,869
How can I make a cake?

90
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,840
I bought it.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,119
A waste of my appreciation.

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,749
Come on.

93
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,999
Let's cheer for Ms. Zhao's return to her career.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,149
Also for her true love.

95
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,069
Congratulation to Little Aunt.

96
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,960
Thank you.

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,840
How is your long-distance relationship?

98
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,190
Forget it.

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,749
It's been 16 days since Qi Heng left. I miss him.

100
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,839
I think you can pay<br>more attention to work

101
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,149
during these days.

102
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,679
Maybe you can get a promotion<br>and your salary raised.

103
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,070
You may even reach the peak of your life.

104
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,909
Little Aunt, I feel like quitting.

105
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,719
I want to go to Shenzhen for Qi Heng.

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
I don't agree with that.

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,469
Giving up everything for love

108
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,239
should be considered.

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,070
You are such a cold woman.

110
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,799
Duoxi, you can't listen to your aunt.

111
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,909
I have taught her many love skills.

112
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,589
Her relationship only came out of luck.

113
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,029
I want to be as lucky as her.

114
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,350
Then I can do well in both love and career.

115
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,309
Well.

116
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,630
What did you want to ask me last night?

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,310
I think

118
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,520
I've had an opponent.

119
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,559
Recently,<br>a woman called Anna appeared.

120
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,189
She seemed to be his ex-girlfriend.

121
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,350
Though Jiaxin explain to me,

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,440
I still feel weird.

123
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,119
Wherever we went, we met her,

124
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,279
and she acted naturally.

125
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,750
I can't find anything wrong.

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,469
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

127
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,559
What's that?

128
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,839
In a relationship,

129
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,959
bad things are more likely to happen

130
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,629
the more you worry about it.

131
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,119
If you think Gu Jiaxin cheats on you,

132
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,279
it may be true.

133
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,749
Impossible.

134
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,559
Gu Jiaxin loves Little Aunt so much.

135
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,629
I don't believe it.

136
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,679
Duoxi, you are too naive.

137
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,629
The woman makes Ms. Zhao feel uncomfortable

138
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,519
by doing nothing.

139
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,519
What does it mean?

140
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,470
It means the woman plays her cards well.

141
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,469
Do you have her photo?

142
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,629
Let me have a look.

143
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,190
Here.

144
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,069
She is not easy to deal with.

145
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,749
We met her in the company.

146
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,840
She looks like the<br>chairwoman in a novel.

147
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,870
I suspect

148
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,280
Gu Jiaxin has a preference

149
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,440
for mature women.

150
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,869
I am the mature one

151
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,680
who has spent more time with him.

152
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,720
That's why he likes me.

153
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,839
Well,<br>you better don't make random guesses

154
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,629
unless you find any evidence.

155
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,469
What should I do?

156
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,869
You should give him more time and hints

157
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,120
to explain it to you.

158
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,960
OK.

159
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,910
I will think about it.

160
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,009
(A meeting with Anna)

161
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,250
(Have lunch with Anna)

162

(Visit Anna's company)

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,440
Darling.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,349
Let's talk about it.

166
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,279
What is it?

167
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,959
It is Motor's birthday today.

168
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,440
I have to join their party.

169
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,310
We can't have dinner together tonight.

170
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,720
OK.

171
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,000
When will you be back?

172
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,679
May be late.

173
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
OK. Just go.

174
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,119
I will bring the files to Fen.

175
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,069
Let's go downstairs together.

176
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,680
OK.

177
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,350
(Room 2206 in Aimei Hotel, booking confirmation)

(Aimei Hotel)

180
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,420
Welcome! Sir.

181
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,319
<i>Gu Jiaxin, you jerk.</i>

182
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,999

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,030
<i>And you expect me to believe you?</i>

184
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,030
Hello. Gu Jiaxin cheats on me.

185
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,639
I saw him go to a hotel room with a woman.

186
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,759
What?

187
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,799
Where are you?

188
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,909
I'm in the hotel.

189
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,909
Stay calm first.

190
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,349
I'll be there in a minute.

191
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,589
You must wait for me.

192
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,240
Quickly.

193
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,120
Jiangyue.

194
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,389
Jiangyue.

195
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:58,999
Don't be impulsive.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,760
Stay calm.

197
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,510
Jiangyue.

198
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,439
I've taken care of the travel plan.

199
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,639
You just need to enjoy the food.

200
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,150
Great.

201
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,389
Jiangyue.

202
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,030
Don't be impulsive.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,829
Jiangyue.

204
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,029
Listen to me.

205
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,800
Close your eyes.

206
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,390
Deep breathe.

207
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,759
Control your emotion.

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,680
Don't be impulsive.

209
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,350
I can't stay calm.

210
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,390
Who is it?

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,510
Well.

212
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,910
Happy birthday to you.

213
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,799
Happy birthday to you.

214
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,389
Happy birthday to you.

215
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,909
- Happy birthday to you.<br>- Happy birthday to me.

216
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,879
Happy birthday!

217
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,830
- Happy!<br>- Happy!

218
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,030
I arrange this.

219
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,270
Welcome!

220
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,149
Why are you still standing there?

221
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,270
Go somewhere else!

222
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,879
I got it. Let's go, buddies.

223
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,759
We will start the next round of the party.

224
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,199
I will buy you drinks.

225
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,470
OK. Let's go.

226
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
Are you here for his birthday?

227
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,830
I just saw you with Anna<br>downstairs at the hotel.

228
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,829
No way.

229
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,319
Do you think I came for Anna?

230
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,439
Otherwise?

231
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,239
Why would you both be here at the same time?

232
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,350
I'm wronged.

233
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,829
Anna stays in this hotel temporarily<br>after she got back to China.

234
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,000
We just happened to meet each other.

235
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,200
What's the relationship between you?

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,559
I heard that she is your ex-girlfriend.

237
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,239
And she is back for you.

238
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,710
Who told you that?

239
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,950
It's fake.

240
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,509
Anna was harassed by a scumbag back then.

241
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,560
I pretended to be her<br>boyfriend and in return,

242
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,879
she did the homework of Economics<br>for me the whole term.

243
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,559
I was busy racing.

244
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,759
So I helped her out of kindness.

245
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,349
Really?

246
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,589
Yes.

247
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,760
Definitely true.

248
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,030
No.

249
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,079
I believe you are hiding something from me.

250
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,590
My sixth sense is always precise.

251
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,200
Well.

252
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,640
I'm hiding something.

253
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,830
But it is not what you think.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,269
It's about the company.

255
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,080
The company?

256
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,880
What happened?

257
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,000
After the accident of "Love Note",

258
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,999
the head office met severe financial crisis.

259
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,829
My mom thought about selling "Love Note"

260
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,079
to stop the loss in time.

261
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,759
She appointed me as acting president

262
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,319
to finish the deal.

263
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,030
You must keep the financial status a secret.

264
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,560
There are other companies that want to buy it.

265
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,830
If we fail,

266
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,880
I will sell it to save the headquarter.

267
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,389
I didn't tell you

268
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,800
because I don't want you to be worried.

269
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,999
K. J Capital that Anna represents

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,879
knew about it somehow.

271
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,640
She wants to buy it from me.

272
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,589
That's why she keeps contacting me.

273
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,679
To be honest,

274
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,590
the conditions she provides are quite tempting.

275
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,349
As long as you help me with the deal,

276
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,150
I will invest in your dream.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,390
I know you want the app.

278
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,320
But I can't sell it to you.

279
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,800
Why?

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,830
Because of a person.

281
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,880
"Love Note" is her dream.

282
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,470
I want to finish it with her.

283
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,639
We will make a new<br>version of "Love Note".

284
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Please give me more time.

285
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,510
I will show you more<br>potentials of "Love Note".

286
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,270
Well.

287
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,440
If you can show me a persuasive plan,

288
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,350
I will consider your suggestion

289
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,509
after I see its potential.

290
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,830
Why don't you tell me earlier?

291
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,760
I planned to tell you<br>after everything is done.

292
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,710
"Love Note" is your dream.

293
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,950
How could I sell it?

294
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,200
Sorry.

295
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,080
I misunderstood you.

296
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,200
It's OK.

297
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,949
Being jealous is what love is.

298
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,270
It's my pleasure

299
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,319
to have you get jealous because of me.

300
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,389
Annoying.

301
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,240
To be serious,

302
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,440
I have known Anna for years.

303
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,800
She is so realistic.

304
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,320
And she does so well in business.

305
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,239
She won't do any deal which is not profitable.

306
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,639
So I have been thinking<br>how we can get her

307
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,560
to invest and save "Love Note".

308
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,969
We need to make an unprecedented update

309
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,530
on our app.

310
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,579
I just met Anna

311
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,900
and wanted to talk about this with her.

312
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,780
I agree.

313
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,729
I have been thinking about

314
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,970
how we can update "Love Note".

315
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,259
Let's get back to the company and work on it.

316
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,609
We can discuss it.

317
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,929
I have some new ideas.

318
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,460
OK.

319
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,050
I do like your serious look about work.

320
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,920
(Duoxi)

321
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,169
Hello.

322
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,409
Hello, Little Aunt.

323
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,099
Read the article published by the public accounts

324
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,289
which I just sent you.

325
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,529
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)<br>It is said

326
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,580
that "Love Note" may be<br>acquired by K. J Capital.

327
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,140
Is it real?

328
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,289
The news has gone viral in the company's group chat.

329
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,370
People are on tenterhooks.

330
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,169
It is a rumor.

331
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,099
I will hold a meeting<br>and tell everyone about that.

332
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,650
No worries.

333
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,380
What happened?

334
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,770
Look at this.

335
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,050
Did Anna leak it?

336
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,620
I think it is possible.

337
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,290
Trust me.

338
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,130
We will not lose.

339
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,290
Mom.

340
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,100
I can't sell "Love Note".

341
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,979
Why?

342
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,979
Because it is what Zhao Jiangyue and all staff

343
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,740
have worked so hard for.

344
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,860
You protected the dream of your lover.

345
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,380
I also want to protect Zhao Jiangyue's dream.

346
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,219
Do you believe in the news?

347
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,250
Is "Love Note" going to be purchased?

348
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,530
Will we have a new boss?

349
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,049
You don't need to worry about that.

350
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,929
The company is not going to go bankrupt.

351
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,499
Right?

352
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,289
Even though the boss is changed,

353
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,339
we still need to work.

354
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,219
It won't be the same.

355
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,929
If it was purchased,

356
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,619
the company's structure would be reorganized.

357
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,889
We have no idea what will happen.

358
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,169
Stopping worrying.

359
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,409
Ms. Zhao said that she will tell us

360
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,459
in the meeting later.

361
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,930
We can ask her when she is here.

362
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,499
Ms. Zhao.

363
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,979
- Ms. Zhao.<br>- Ms. Zhao.

364
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,289
What happened?

365
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,169
-Ms. Zhao<br>-Jiaxin.

366
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:57,979
What happened?

367
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,219
Is the company going to be acquired?

368
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,499
- Right?<br>- Will it be acquired?

369
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,380
Don't worry.

370
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,169
To be honest,<br>"Love Note" is facing some crisis.

371
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,100
But it is not that serious, we will not lose it.

372
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,859
Everyone spent<br>great effort on the app.

373
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,500
I hope we can work together in the future.

374
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:14,859
Ms. Zhao.

375
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,580
We are relieved with your words.

376
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,819
Ms. Zhao,<br>"Love Note" is yours as well as ours.

377
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,379
We would like to go through thick and thin for it.

378
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,289
If you need us, just tell us.

379
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,219
No matter what happens,

380
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,100
we will go through thick and thin for it.

381
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:26,859
Right!

382
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,649
Let's work together.

383
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,049
Cheer up!

384
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,820
No worries.

385
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,979
I promise on my reputation

386
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,930
that "Love Note" will not be bought easily.

387
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,979
OK.

388
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,579
Well. Let's work!

389
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:38,859
OK.

390
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,220
Let's go.

391
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,219
Anna, did you send the news?

392
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,339
The news of the acquisition?

393
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,979
I thought we reached an agreement

394
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
that you'd give me more time.

395
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,859
Acquisition is probably not the best way.

396
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,649
Jiaxin, believe it or not.

397
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,290
It was not from me.

398
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,170
But

399
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,979
I don't mind the reactions of the market.

400
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,339
You know I work to<br>make money by money.

401
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,739
Capital comes with a cost.

402
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,929
I will not mix friends and business.

403
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,819
I would like to trust you as a friend.

404
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,170
But as a business partner,

405
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,889
it is hard for me to believe

406
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,859
a new worker can solve such a knotty problem

407
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,580
in a short time.

408
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,050
Anna.

409
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,100
I will show you a plan that satisfies you.

410
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,860
Easier said than done.

411
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,740
I will give you one more week.

412
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,049
If you still can't provide a good enough plan,

413
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,219
I'll discuss the details<br>of the acquisition with Ms. Jin

414
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,860
without notifying you.

415
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,290
Anna.

416
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,460
Don't worry.

417
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,619
I will give you the plan this week.

418
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,740
You can talk to Anna first.

419
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,409
In the news,<br>I saw lots of financial information

420
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,219
which hasn't even been publicized

421
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,859
within the company.

422
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,460
It is not what Anna can get.

423
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Is there a spy?

424
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:40,500
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)

425
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,619
How could this happen?

426
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,819
What's wrong, darling?

427
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,980
Why are you sighing?

428
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,500
Read the news.

429
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,980
What should we do?

430
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:54,342
Ms. Zhao.

431
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,130
See what I just found.

432
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,930
What?

433
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,289
I watched all the videos on this account.

434
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,459
I think she is Qian Jingjing.

435
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,889
Some fans also comment below

436
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,980
that it is her alternate account.

437
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,649
It does look like Qian Jingjing's apartment.

438
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,049
We are making a new version of the app.

439
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,819
Can we catch people's attention

440
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,739
with the current situation

441
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,220
of Qian Jingjing and Zhang Hao?

442
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,979
Ms. Zhao. Jiaxin...

443
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,740
No. Mr. Gu asked you to go to his office.

444
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:22,980
OK.

445
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,459
I don't want to hype Qian Jingjing.

446
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,860
Let's find some new ideas.

447
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,620
Sorry.

448
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,820
Can you be careful next time?

449
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,259

(Blueberry Entertainment)<br>(Qian Jingjing's Divorce)

451
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,499
<i>Isn't it the gossip media</i>

452
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,700
<i>that discloses the news of Jingjing's divorce?</i>

453
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,220
Here you are.

454
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,290
What happened?

455
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,529
Jingjing just called

456
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,860
and asked us to have dinner at their home.

457
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,340
OK.

458
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,290
What's wrong?

459
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,130
Little Gu,<br>could you also be this worried?

460
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,500
It is so hard to be a domineering president.

461
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,460
Anything is easy.

462
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,010
Didn't you suggest I be confident yesterday?

463
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,009
Why do you get cold feet today?

464
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,010
I don't.

465
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,770
I just

466
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,340
don't want to let you down.

467
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,620
Why would you think that?

468
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,740
I want to be the one<br>who you can rely on.

469
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,379
I also want to spare no effort

470
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,700
to solve the issues of the company.

471
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,890
But I am afraid that I can't do it well.

472
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,460
I have been thinking about

473
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,820
what I would do if I<br>were Xu Ningyuan.

474
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,700
I can't figure it out.

475
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,250
What nonsense are you talking about?

476
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,050
How can you be so harsh?

477
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,740
I am telling you,

478
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,650
you are unique.

479
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,769
I chose to be with you because you are Gu Jiaxin.

480
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,169
No one can replace you.

481
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,010
Do you know?

482
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,620
The bigger the responsibility you take,<br>the greater the pressure is.

483
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,530
No worries.

484
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,100
I will always be with you.

485
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,860
Yueyue,

486
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,980
I'm lucky to meet you.

487
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,620
Well. Alright, alright.

488
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,289
I have something want to tell you.

489
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:12,930
Go ahead.

490
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,930
I met Song Xue on my way here.

491
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,820
She dropped a business card.

492
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,129
Isn't it the media

493
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,010
that exposes the news of Qian Jingjing's divorce?

494
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,739
If Song Xue is the backstage manipulator,

495
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,170
she is not doing it<br>only to ruin Jingjing.

496
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,130
What do you mean?

497
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,010
The exposure of the divorce

498
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,740
hurts both Jingjing and our app.

499
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,889
We must investigate her.

500
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,380
OK.

501
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,340
You focus on the plan

502
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,340
and I will pay more attention to Song Xue.

503
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,649
Are you hungry?

504
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,460
Yes.

505
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,499
- Finally!<br>- Jingjing.

506
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,249
Come in.

507
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,169
Jiaxin.

508
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,289
- Come in.<br>- Jingjing.

509
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,819
I bring two bottles of wine for you and Hao.

510
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,739
It's Guangliang Wine.

511
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,859
Simple but sincere.

512
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,499
Thank you.

513
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,169
Come on. Welcome.

514
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,929
- Come on, sit down.<br>- Sit down.

515
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,579
The dinner starts as soon as we arrive.

516
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,889
The main dish will come later.

517
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,890
You can talk while having dinner.

518
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,739
Please try the dishes made by Zhang Hao.

519
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,129
Look at Zhang Hao.

520
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,649
Gu Jiaxin always orders<br>deliveries for me only.

521
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,980
As long as you like it,

522
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,649
I will learn from Hao immediately.

523
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,250
OK.

524
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,009
You are still so sweet.

525
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,009
Young people are indeed of great enthusiasm.

526
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,410
You are also sweet.

527
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,770
Why would you invite me over for dinner today?

528
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,170
I just want to know

529
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,930
how is the company?

530
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,100
Is the news true?

531
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,220
Someone wants to buy "Love Note".

532
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,929
Jiaxin said that we must have a new version.

533
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,340
We may be able to save it.

534
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,580
I want to show you something.

535
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,859
(Daily Sweets)<br>A co-worker asked me

536
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,100
if it is your account.

537
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,620
It gives more valuable tips for living<br>than your official account does.

538
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,100
Hearing your words,<br>I'm relieved.

539
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,250
I want to discuss something with you.

540
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,580
What is it?

541
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,410
I want to make a comeback for you.

542
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,580
What do you think?

543
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,620
Do you still remember

544
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,340
when I was fat in high school?

545
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,250
I was mocked and bullied every day.

546
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,530
It is you who protected me.

547
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,170
Then I met Zhang Hao and got married to him.

548
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,500
He takes good care of me in all aspects.

549
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,650
My first response was<br>escaping when I divorced

550
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,249
and affected the app.

551
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,289
To be honest,

552
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,009
I have avoided facing it for a long time.

553
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,220
I want to be brave this time.

554
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,250
And I also want to protect you once.

555
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,770
Let me do something for you.

556
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,619
Jingjing, but...

557
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,819
Though my impact

558
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,100
is not as great as before.

559
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,459
I still want to help if you need me.

560
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,009
There is strength in numbers.

561
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,170
It's better than you two handling it alone.

562
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,220
I had a conversation with Jingjing<br>before we came here.

563
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,379
I think the real love<br>behind the fake news

564
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,890
of Jingjing and Hao

565
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,579
is very moving.

566
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,459
We can start from this point.

567
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,740
It is good for both<br>Jingjing and us.

568
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,860
Well.

569
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,010
Are you okay with that, Zhang Hao?

570
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,250
Of course.

571
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,010
I was self-righteous and<br>made many bad decisions.

572
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,459
It not only created

573
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,459
many blocks in our relationship

574
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,339
but also affected your program.

575
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,530
I will listen to Jingjing.

576
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,379
No matter what she does,

577
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,380
I will stand with her firmly.

578
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,050
Come on.

579
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,649
Difficulties are nothing.

580
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,819

581
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,819
Come on.

582
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,049
- Come on.<br>- Cheers.

583
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,820
Let's work hard!

(Six-Day Countdown)

585
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,250
I asked you to come here so late

586
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,820
for a discussion.

587
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:27,930
Now,

588
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,739
we have a chance to save "Love Note".

589
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,009
The premise is that

590
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,130
we need to offer a convincing program

591
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,580
within a week.

592
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,290
It is not easy,

593
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,890
but I still believe in you.

594
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,860
Does anyone want to join?

595
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,009
OK.

596
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,739
Let's finish the impossible task.

597
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,649
Come on.

598
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,649
- Come on.<br>- Come on.

Anna,

613
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,340
what do you think about the plan?

614
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,100
Did you make it within a week?

615
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,859
Yes.

616
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,129
The time is limited,

617
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,860
so there may be many imperfections.

618
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,290
It's OK. Anna.

619
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,100
You can tell us your thoughts.

620
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,010
I want you to explain<br>the theme of the plan first.

621
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
I will tell you a story.

622
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,290
There was a girl who was so good at work

623
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,740
but was bad in love.

624
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,500
<i>She wanted to make "Love Note" work</i>

625
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,289
<i>because she knew there were girls like her</i>

626
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,770
(Task: Not Single. Time Limit: Three Months)<br><i>in the world</i>

627
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,219
<i>who know nothing about love</i>

628
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,380
<i>and need guidance about love.</i>

629
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,129
<i>They think a tool<br>teaching them love tricks</i>

630
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,250
<i>and skills systematically</i>

631
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,130
can tell them the secret of love.

632
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,050
Then

633
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,340
she met a variable in her life.

634
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,250
<i>The impossible love<br>changed into loving her only.</i>

635
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,340
It made her realize that all the tricks and skills

636
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,700
are nothing in front of real love.

637
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,180
Sincerity

638
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,029
is the only path towards love.

639
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,910
The program

640
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,029
is her loving process.

641
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,220
You are the variable, right?

642
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,270
Yes.

643
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,909
We want to make

644
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,789
a new version of the app this time.

645
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,669
It is updated in all aspects.

646
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,629
We will change to mental guidance

647
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,340
from technical guidance.

648
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,869
We add a socializing section to it.

649
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,269
We also revise the algorithm of big data

650
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,909
to change the match-making

651
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,030
from outer conditions to mental appeal.

652
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,669
They can join the matching group

653
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,299
when they have the same preference.

654
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,299
It allows people eager for love

655
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,869
but find it difficult to meet love

656
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,390
to meet the one with the same preference and goal.

657
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,430
To be honest,

658
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,059
the program made within a week

659
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,150
can't meet my criteria.

660
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,980
Welcome.

661
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,340
OK. I will place the order for you.

662
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,580
Sir, here you are.

663
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,149
Sir, I have a secret.

664
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,429
What is it?

665
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,740
I think I may have found the spy of our company.

666
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,430
I happened to see it.

667
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,870
I also have the voice record.

668
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,339
I am about to become the hero

669
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,390
who saves the company.

670
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,099
I have fully understood it

671
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,709
after hearing what you told me last time.

672
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,779
Though my love comes to nothing,<br>I decide to

673
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,710
save Gu Jiaxin for the last time.

674
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,099
Then I will walk away,

675
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,710
which makes him remember me forever.

676
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,189
Don't laugh.

677
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,539
I mean it.

678
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,819
Fortunately, I found the spy.

679
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,579
Otherwise, the company

680
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,909
will be ruined by the two women.

681
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,780
May I listen to your evidence?

682
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,989
I planned to listen to it with Gu Jiaxin.

683
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,710
Since you are eager to do so

684
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,230
and you are one of us.

685
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,499
Okay then.

686
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,060
I will let you listen to it.

687
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,370
(Play)

688
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,150
What did she say?

689
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,470
Come to my office.

690
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,230
What did Anna say?

691
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,020
What did she say?

692
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,949
Hey.

693
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,230
Say something!

694
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,300
Did she turn us down?

695
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,579
Say something!

696
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,869
Why are you in silence?

697
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,100
What did she say?

698
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,100
She said

699
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,259
she agreed to let us make a new version.

700
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,909
Really?

701
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,669
Yes, she agreed.

702
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,669
She decided to invest in "Love Note"

703
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,580
and support the revision.

704
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,339
Great!

705
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,260
Let me show you something.

706
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,630
What's this?

707
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,780
It is the same as the previous investigation.

708
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,099
Song Xue is guilty.

709
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,469
She told Anna our<br>financial problem secretly

710
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,499
and encouraged Anna to buy our app

711
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,740
as an internal deal with her.

712
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,390
Did Anna tell you about it?

713
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,099
Though Anna wants to get our program,

714
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,229
she keeps an eye on Song Xue.

715
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,019
Song Xue betrayed the company easily,

716
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,230
so she wouldn't believe in her.

717
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,389
We reach an agreement now.

718
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,780
She told me this as a favor.

719
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,780
This is the record of their communication.

720
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,300
It is the best beginning.

721
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,300
Everything is possible

722
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,500
because of you.

723
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,740
Gu Jiaxin.

724
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,300
What is it?

725
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,870
Wait. Why didn't you knock on the door?

726
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,989
Why don't you hang<br>a Do-Not-Enter sign

727
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,300
when you kiss?

728
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,819
Yanran, do you come to Jiaxin for something?

729
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,870
I suspect Anna and Song Xue cooperate in secret.

730
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,580
There is a spy in the company and it is Song Xue.

731
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,470
Tell me.

732
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,870
I met them in a coffee shop

733
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,820
and I had a voice record.

734
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,630
Though there is no obvious evidence in it...

735
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,189
<i>Did you have painless labor?</i>

736
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,229
<i>How is it?</i>

737
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,580
<i>Yes. No one can deny it.</i>

738
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,910
<i>I felt like in heaven within a second.</i>

739
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,189
<i>What does it mean?</i>

740
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,260
<i>I felt less pain</i>

741
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,470
<i>after the injection.</i>

742
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,389
Though I did not record any valid evidence,

743
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,669
I do suspect them.

744
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,260
There are signs.

745
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,149
As soon as the crisis happened,

746
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,579
Song Xue went back to the company

747
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,469
and took Jiangyue's position immediately.

748
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,869
As soon as the crisis happened,

749
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,259
Song Xue went back to the company

750
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,629
and took Ms. Zhao's position immediately.

751
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,669
It's hard not to suspect that

752
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,539
It's hard not to suspect that

753
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,780
she did that in secret.

754
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,670
What's more,<br>why did Anna appear...

755
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,779
Exactly when Jin<br>Yan was in hospital?

756
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,019
What a coincidence.

757
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,949
If Song Xue catches the<br>chance and makes the deal,

758
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,539
she is very likely to...

759
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,869
She is very likely to take over.

760
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,059
As she pleased...

761
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,189
She can control "Love Note" as she pleased.

762
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,539
In a word,<br>Sons Xue is quite suspicious.

763
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,990
I suggest you have a thorough investigation.

764
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,780
Yanran,

765
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,990
great speech.

766
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,910
We have got the evidence.

767
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,870
You have gotten the evidence?

768
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,390
Anna gave it to me

769
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,539
and Jiangyue found

770
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,260
that Song Xue is to be blamed<br>for Qian Jingjing's divorce.

771
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,059
What a black sheep!

772
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,259
Why did she do that?

773
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,500
Ms. Jin is good to her.

774
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,229
<i>Excuse me, I have to go to the restroom.</i>

775
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,870
<i>OK.</i>

776
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,340
<i>Hello.</i>

777
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,990
<i>Why didn't you send the baby to the hospital<br>when he was sick?</i>

778
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,910
He is suffering from a severe cough.

779
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,300
You're busy.

780
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,100
Are you the only one who is busy?

781
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,540
Can't you think more about me?

782
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,339
If you aren't in heavy debt

783
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,230
and become a defaulter,<br>do I have to work?

784
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,230
<i>OK. I get it.</i>

785
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,190
<i>What did I do to deserve this?</i>

786
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,740
A couple of days ago,

787
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,779
I heard from my business partners

788
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,739
that the company of Song Xue's husband

789
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,910
was about to bankrupt.

790
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,780
She had no choice

791
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,670
but came back to the company.

792
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,909
It was her who spared no effort to

793
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,189
marry into the purple.

794
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,500
She made it with her baby.

795
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,299
She is now betraying the company

796
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,630
to obtain personal profit.

797
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,710
I despise her.

798
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:54,990
In any case,

799
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,190
thank you for your help.

800
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,630
I help you just because...

801
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,949
I will always help when seeing injustice.

802
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,820
I am also a part of the company.

803
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,150
(Murphy's Law of Love)

804
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,020
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

805
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,429
No.

806
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,390
Are you talking about the psychological effect?

807
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,189
If there is a chance to go wrong in something,

808
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,019
it will always happen

809
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,389
no matter how little the chance is.

810
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,539
Yes, it is.

811
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,060
The app said that Murphy's Law also works in love.

812
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,230
What does it mean?

813
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,339
When someone wants to cheat,

814
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,930
temptation always appears.

815
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,539
It gets harder to maintain a relationship

816
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,579
when it missed something at the beginning.

817
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,249
Oh my god. It is so correct.

818
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,209
Right?

819
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,299
And this.

820
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,409
A person who is hard to get

821
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,619
will not be with you for a long time

822
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,650
even if you make it.

823
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,250
Really?

824
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,689
Do I need to give up<br>on my Prince Charming?

825
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,019
Don't you change it every day?

826
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,059
No.

827
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,409
Look at this. It is right.

828
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,489
Murphy's Law tells us<br>humans are getting smarter.

829
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,489
But it is never possible for a human

830
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,539
to know about everything in this universe.

831
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,339
Making mistakes easily is<br>a weakness born with us.

832
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,299
In a relationship,

833
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,379
there are things that we can't avoid.

834
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,822
What we can do is to stay true to the original self

835
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:40,982
and cut loss in time.

836
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:42,782
Well said!
