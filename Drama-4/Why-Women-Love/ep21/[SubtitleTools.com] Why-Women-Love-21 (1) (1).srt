Ms. Zhao?

31
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,089
Anna.

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,899
What a coincidence!

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,539
I didn't expect to meet you here.

34
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,009
Do you come for dinner?

35
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,810
Yes. Do you want me to join?

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,860
Come on. Take a seat.

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,219
That will be great. I will join.

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,090
Come on.

39
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,329
Ms. Zhao, would you mind?

40
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,500
No. Just a meal.

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,220
Little Jiaxin.

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,330
Did you consider things that

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,980
I told you?

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,660
Jiangyue,<br>I will talk with Anna there for a while.

45
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,939
I'll be back soon.

46
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,220
Anna, let's talk over there.

47
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,940
Anna, about that...

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,329
I have to think about it more.

49
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,099
OK?

50
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,589

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,169
Bye.

55
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:36,770
Bye, Anna.

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,100
I'm sorry, darling.

57
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,820
what's going on?

58
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,579
Why were you talking again?

59
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,659
What do you need to consider?

60
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,770
Just work.

61
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,739
She wants to cooperate with us.

62
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,690
We are still working on the details.

63
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,610
Come on, let's eat.

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,409
Are you angry?

65
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,019
No.

66
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,249
Let's have dinner.

67
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,020
I will order.

68
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,170

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,770
What's this?

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,099
Hello.

78
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,329
Jingjing.

79
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,889
Will you be home tomorrow afternoon?

80
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,820
I've got something to ask you.

81
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,939
Come on.

82
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,529
This is the afternoon tea I've prepared.

83
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:14,969
What do you think?

84
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,610
Is it good?

85
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,769
Nice.

86
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,539
You can even make cakes.

87
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,259
What did Zhang Hao do to you?

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,259
You silly.

89
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,569
How can I make a cake?

90
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,540
I bought it.

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,819
A waste of my appreciation.

92
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,449
Come on.

93
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,699
Let's cheer for Ms. Zhao's return to her career.

94
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,849
Also for her true love.

95
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,769
Congratulation to Little Aunt.

96
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,660
Thank you.

97
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,540
How is your long-distance relationship?

98
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,890
Forget it.

99
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,449
It's been 16 days since Qi Heng left. I miss him.

100
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,539
I think you can pay<br>more attention to work

101
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,849
during these days.

102
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,379
Maybe you can get a promotion<br>and your salary raised.

103
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,770
You may even reach the peak of your life.

104
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,609
Little Aunt, I feel like quitting.

105
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,419
I want to go to Shenzhen for Qi Heng.

106
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,500
I don't agree with that.

107
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,169
Giving up everything for love

108
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,939
should be considered.

109
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,770
You are such a cold woman.

110
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,499
Duoxi, you can't listen to your aunt.

111
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,609
I have taught her many love skills.

112
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,289
Her relationship only came out of luck.

113
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,729
I want to be as lucky as her.

114
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,050
Then I can do well in both love and career.

115
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,009
Well.

116
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,330
What did you want to ask me last night?

117
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,010
I think

118
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,220
I've had an opponent.

119
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,259
Recently,<br>a woman called Anna appeared.

120
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,889
She seemed to be his ex-girlfriend.

121
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,050
Though Jiaxin explain to me,

122
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,140
I still feel weird.

123
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,819
Wherever we went, we met her,

124
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,979
and she acted naturally.

125
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,450
I can't find anything wrong.

126
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,169
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

127
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,259
What's that?

128
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,539
In a relationship,

129
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,659
bad things are more likely to happen

130
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,329
the more you worry about it.

131
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,819
If you think Gu Jiaxin cheats on you,

132
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,979
it may be true.

133
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,449
Impossible.

134
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,259
Gu Jiaxin loves Little Aunt so much.

135
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,329
I don't believe it.

136
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,379
Duoxi, you are too naive.

137
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,329
The woman makes Ms. Zhao feel uncomfortable

138
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,219
by doing nothing.

139
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,219
What does it mean?

140
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,170
It means the woman plays her cards well.

141
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,169
Do you have her photo?

142
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,329
Let me have a look.

143
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:21,890
Here.

144
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,769
She is not easy to deal with.

145
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,449
We met her in the company.

146
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,540
She looks like the<br>chairwoman in a novel.

147
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,570
I suspect

148
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,980
Gu Jiaxin has a preference

149
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,140
for mature women.

150
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,569
I am the mature one

151
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,380
who has spent more time with him.

152
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,420
That's why he likes me.

153
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,539
Well,<br>you better don't make random guesses

154
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,329
unless you find any evidence.

155
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,169
What should I do?

156
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,569
You should give him more time and hints

157
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,820
to explain it to you.

158
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,660
OK.

159
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,610
I will think about it.

160
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:17,709
(A meeting with Anna)

161
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,950
(Have lunch with Anna)

162
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,300
(Offline meeting with Anna)

163

(Visit Anna's company)

164
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,140
Darling.

165
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,049
Let's talk about it.

166
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,979
What is it?

167
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,659
It is Motor's birthday today.

168
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,140
I have to join their party.

169
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,010
We can't have dinner together tonight.

170
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,420
OK.

171
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,700
When will you be back?

172
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,379
May be late.

173
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,700
OK. Just go.

174
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,819
I will bring the files to Fen.

175
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,769
Let's go downstairs together.

176
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,380
OK.

177
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,050
(Room 2206 in Aimei Hotel, booking confirmation)

178

Let's go

179

(Aimei Hotel)

180
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,120
Welcome! Sir.

181
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,019
<i>Gu Jiaxin, you jerk.</i>

182
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,699
<i>A birthday party of your friend?</i>

183
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,730
<i>And you expect me to believe you?</i>

184
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,730
Hello. Gu Jiaxin cheats on me.

185
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,339
I saw him go to a hotel room with a woman.

186
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,459
What?

187
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,499
Where are you?

188
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,609
I'm in the hotel.

189
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,609
Stay calm first.

190
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,049
I'll be there in a minute.

191
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,289
You must wait for me.

192
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,940
Quickly.

193
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,820
Jiangyue.

194
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,089
Jiangyue.

195
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,699
Don't be impulsive.

196
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,460
Stay calm.

197
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,210
Jiangyue.

198
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,139
I've taken care of the travel plan.

199
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,339
You just need to enjoy the food.

200
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,850
Great.

201
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,089
Jiangyue.

202
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,730
Don't be impulsive.

203
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,529
Jiangyue.

204
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,729
Listen to me.

205
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,500
Close your eyes.

206
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,090
Deep breathe.

207
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,459
Control your emotion.

208
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,380
Don't be impulsive.

209
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,050
I can't stay calm.

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,090
Who is it?

211
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,210
Well.

212
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,610
Happy birthday to you.

213
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,499
Happy birthday to you.

214
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,089
Happy birthday to you.

215
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,609
- Happy birthday to you.<br>- Happy birthday to me.

216
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,579
Happy birthday!

217
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,530
- Happy!<br>- Happy!

218
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,730
I arrange this.

219
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,970
Welcome!

220
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,849
Why are you still standing there?

221
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,970
Go somewhere else!

222
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,579
I got it. Let's go, buddies.

223
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,459
We will start the next round of the party.

224
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,899
I will buy you drinks.

225
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,170
OK. Let's go.

226
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,940
Are you here for his birthday?

227
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,530
I just saw you with Anna<br>downstairs at the hotel.

228
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,529
No way.

229
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,019
Do you think I came for Anna?

230
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,139
Otherwise?

231
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,939
Why would you both be here at the same time?

232
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,050
I'm wronged.

233
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,529
Anna stays in this hotel temporarily<br>after she got back to China.

234
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,700
We just happened to meet each other.

235
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,900
What's the relationship between you?

236
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,259
I heard that she is your ex-girlfriend.

237
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,939
And she is back for you.

238
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,410
Who told you that?

239
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,650
It's fake.

240
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,209
Anna was harassed by a scumbag back then.

241
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,260
I pretended to be her<br>boyfriend and in return,

242
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,579
she did the homework of Economics<br>for me the whole term.

243
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,259
I was busy racing.

244
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,459
So I helped her out of kindness.

245
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,049
Really?

246
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,289
Yes.

247
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,460
Definitely true.

248
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:30,730
No.

249
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,779
I believe you are hiding something from me.

250
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,290
My sixth sense is always precise.

251
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,900
Well.

252
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,340
I'm hiding something.

253
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,530
But it is not what you think.

254
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,969
It's about the company.

255
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,780
The company?

256
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,580
What happened?

257
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,700
After the accident of "Love Note",

258
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,699
the head office met severe financial crisis.

259
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,529
My mom thought about selling "Love Note"

260
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,779
to stop the loss in time.

261
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,459
She appointed me as acting president

262
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,019
to finish the deal.

263
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,730
You must keep the financial status a secret.

264
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,260
There are other companies that want to buy it.

265
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,530
If we fail,

266
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,580
I will sell it to save the headquarter.

267
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,089
I didn't tell you

268
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,500
because I don't want you to be worried.

269
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,699
K. J Capital that Anna represents

270
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,579
knew about it somehow.

271
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,340
She wants to buy it from me.

272
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,289
That's why she keeps contacting me.

273
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,379
To be honest,

274
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,290
the conditions she provides are quite tempting.

275
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,049
As long as you help me with the deal,

276
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,850
I will invest in your dream.

277
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,090
I know you want the app.

278
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,020
But I can't sell it to you.

279
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,500
Why?

280
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,530
Because of a person.

281
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,580
"Love Note" is her dream.

282
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,170
I want to finish it with her.

283
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,339
We will make a new<br>version of "Love Note".

284
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
Please give me more time.

285
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,210
I will show you more<br>potentials of "Love Note".

286
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,970
Well.

287
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,140
If you can show me a persuasive plan,

288
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,050
I will consider your suggestion

289
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,209
after I see its potential.

290
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,530
Why don't you tell me earlier?

291
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,460
I planned to tell you<br>after everything is done.

292
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,410
"Love Note" is your dream.

293
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,650
How could I sell it?

294
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,900
Sorry.

295
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,780
I misunderstood you.

296
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,900
It's OK.

297
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,649
Being jealous is what love is.

298
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,970
It's my pleasure

299
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,019
to have you get jealous because of me.

300
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,089
Annoying.

301
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,940
To be serious,

302
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,140
I have known Anna for years.

303
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,500
She is so realistic.

304
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,020
And she does so well in business.

305
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,939
She won't do any deal which is not profitable.

306
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,339
So I have been thinking<br>how we can get her

307
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,260
to invest and save "Love Note".

308
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,669
We need to make an unprecedented update

309
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,230
on our app.

310
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,279
I just met Anna

311
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,600
and wanted to talk about this with her.

312
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,480
I agree.

313
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,429
I have been thinking about

314
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,670
how we can update "Love Note".

315
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,959
Let's get back to the company and work on it.

316
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,309
We can discuss it.

317
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,629
I have some new ideas.

318
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,160
OK.

319
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,750
I do like your serious look about work.

320
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,620
(Duoxi)

321
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,869
Hello.

322
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,109
Hello, Little Aunt.

323
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,799
Read the article published by the public accounts

324
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,989
which I just sent you.

325
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,229
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)<br>It is said

326
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,280
that "Love Note" may be<br>acquired by K. J Capital.

327
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,840
Is it real?

328
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,989
The news has gone viral in the company's group chat.

329
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,070
People are on tenterhooks.

330
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,869
It is a rumor.

331
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,799
I will hold a meeting<br>and tell everyone about that.

332
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,350
No worries.

333
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,080
What happened?

334
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,470
Look at this.

335
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,750
Did Anna leak it?

336
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,320
I think it is possible.

337
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,990
Trust me.

338
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,830
We will not lose.

339
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,990
Mom.

340
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,800
I can't sell "Love Note".

341
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,679
Why?

342
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,679
Because it is what Zhao Jiangyue and all staff

343
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,440
have worked so hard for.

344
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,560
You protected the dream of your lover.

345
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,080
I also want to protect Zhao Jiangyue's dream.

346
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,919
Do you believe in the news?

347
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,950
Is "Love Note" going to be purchased?

348
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,230
Will we have a new boss?

349
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,749
You don't need to worry about that.

350
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,629
The company is not going to go bankrupt.

351
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,199
Right?

352
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,989
Even though the boss is changed,

353
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,039
we still need to work.

354
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,919
It won't be the same.

355
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,629
If it was purchased,

356
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,319
the company's structure would be reorganized.

357
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,589
We have no idea what will happen.

358
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,869
Stopping worrying.

359
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,109
Ms. Zhao said that she will tell us

360
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,159
in the meeting later.

361
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,630
We can ask her when she is here.

362
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,199
Ms. Zhao.

363
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,679
- Ms. Zhao.<br>- Ms. Zhao.

364
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,989
What happened?

365
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,869
-Ms. Zhao<br>-Jiaxin.

366
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,679
What happened?

367
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,919
Is the company going to be acquired?

368
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,199
- Right?<br>- Will it be acquired?

369
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,080
Don't worry.

370
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,869
To be honest,<br>"Love Note" is facing some crisis.

371
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,800
But it is not that serious, we will not lose it.

372
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,559
Everyone spent<br>great effort on the app.

373
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,200
I hope we can work together in the future.

374
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,559
Ms. Zhao.

375
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,280
We are relieved with your words.

376
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,519
Ms. Zhao,<br>"Love Note" is yours as well as ours.

377
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,079
We would like to go through thick and thin for it.

378
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,989
If you need us, just tell us.

379
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,919
No matter what happens,

380
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,800
we will go through thick and thin for it.

381
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,559
Right!

382
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,349
Let's work together.

383
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,749
Cheer up!

384
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,520
No worries.

385
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,679
I promise on my reputation

386
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,630
that "Love Note" will not be bought easily.

387
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,679
OK.

388
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,279
Well. Let's work!

389
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,559
OK.

390
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,920
Let's go.

391
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,919
Anna, did you send the news?

392
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,039
The news of the acquisition?

393
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,679
I thought we reached an agreement

394
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
that you'd give me more time.

395
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,559
Acquisition is probably not the best way.

396
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,349
Jiaxin, believe it or not.

397
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,990
It was not from me.

398
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,870
But

399
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,679
I don't mind the reactions of the market.

400
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,039
You know I work to<br>make money by money.

401
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,439
Capital comes with a cost.

402
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,629
I will not mix friends and business.

403
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,519
I would like to trust you as a friend.

404
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,870
But as a business partner,

405
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,589
it is hard for me to believe

406
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,559
a new worker can solve such a knotty problem

407
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,280
in a short time.

408
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,750
Anna.

409
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,800
I will show you a plan that satisfies you.

410
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,560
Easier said than done.

411
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,440
I will give you one more week.

412
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,749
If you still can't provide a good enough plan,

413
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,919
I'll discuss the details<br>of the acquisition with Ms. Jin

414
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,560
without notifying you.

415
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,990
Anna.

416
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,160
Don't worry.

417
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,319
I will give you the plan this week.

418
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,440
You can talk to Anna first.

419
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,109
In the news,<br>I saw lots of financial information

420
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,919
which hasn't even been publicized

421
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,559
within the company.

422
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,160
It is not what Anna can get.

423
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Is there a spy?

424
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:41,200
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)

425
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,319
How could this happen?

426
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,519
What's wrong, darling?

427
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,680
Why are you sighing?

428
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,200
Read the news.

429
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,680
What should we do?

430
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:55,042
Ms. Zhao.

431
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,830
See what I just found.

432
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,630
What?

433
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,989
I watched all the videos on this account.

434
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,159
I think she is Qian Jingjing.

435
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,589
Some fans also comment below

436
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,680
that it is her alternate account.

437
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,349
It does look like Qian Jingjing's apartment.

438
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,749
We are making a new version of the app.

439
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,519
Can we catch people's attention

440
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,439
with the current situation

441
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
of Qian Jingjing and Zhang Hao?

442
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,679
Ms. Zhao. Jiaxin...

443
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,440
No. Mr. Gu asked you to go to his office.

444
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,680
OK.

445
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,159
I don't want to hype Qian Jingjing.

446
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,560
Let's find some new ideas.

447
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,320
Sorry.

448
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,520
Can you be careful next time?

449
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,959

(Blueberry Entertainment)<br>(Qian Jingjing's Divorce)

451
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,199
<i>Isn't it the gossip media</i>

452
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
<i>that discloses the news of Jingjing's divorce?</i>

453
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,920
Here you are.

454
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,990
What happened?

455
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,229
Jingjing just called

456
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,560
and asked us to have dinner at their home.

457
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,040
OK.

458
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,990
What's wrong?

459
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,830
Little Gu,<br>could you also be this worried?

460
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
It is so hard to be a domineering president.

461
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
Anything is easy.

462
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,710
Didn't you suggest I be confident yesterday?

463
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,709
Why do you get cold feet today?

464
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,710
I don't.

465
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,470
I just

466
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,040
don't want to let you down.

467
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,320
Why would you think that?

468
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,440
I want to be the one<br>who you can rely on.

469
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,079
I also want to spare no effort

470
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,400
to solve the issues of the company.

471
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,590
But I am afraid that I can't do it well.

472
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,160
I have been thinking about

473
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,520
what I would do if I<br>were Xu Ningyuan.

474
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,400
I can't figure it out.

475
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,950
What nonsense are you talking about?

476
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,750
How can you be so harsh?

477
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,440
I am telling you,

478
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,350
you are unique.

479
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,469
I chose to be with you because you are Gu Jiaxin.

480
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,869
No one can replace you.

481
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,710
Do you know?

482
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,320
The bigger the responsibility you take,<br>the greater the pressure is.

483
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,230
No worries.

484
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,800
I will always be with you.

485
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,560
Yueyue,

486
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm lucky to meet you.

487
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,320
Well. Alright, alright.

488
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,989
I have something want to tell you.

489
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,630
Go ahead.

490
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,630
I met Song Xue on my way here.

491
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,520
She dropped a business card.

492
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,829
Isn't it the media

493
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,710
that exposes the news of Qian Jingjing's divorce?

494
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,439
If Song Xue is the backstage manipulator,

495
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,870
she is not doing it<br>only to ruin Jingjing.

496
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,830
What do you mean?

497
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,710
The exposure of the divorce

498
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,440
hurts both Jingjing and our app.

499
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,589
We must investigate her.

500
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,080
OK.

501
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,040
You focus on the plan

502
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,040
and I will pay more attention to Song Xue.

503
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,349
Are you hungry?

504
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,160
Yes.

505
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,199
- Finally!<br>- Jingjing.

506
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,949
Come in.

507
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,869
Jiaxin.

508
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,989
- Come in.<br>- Jingjing.

509
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,519
I bring two bottles of wine for you and Hao.

510
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,439
It's Guangliang Wine.

511
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,559
Simple but sincere.

512
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,199
Thank you.

513
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,869
Come on. Welcome.

514
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,629
- Come on, sit down.<br>- Sit down.

515
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,279
The dinner starts as soon as we arrive.

516
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,589
The main dish will come later.

517
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,590
You can talk while having dinner.

518
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,439
Please try the dishes made by Zhang Hao.

519
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,829
Look at Zhang Hao.

520
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,349
Gu Jiaxin always orders<br>deliveries for me only.

521
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,680
As long as you like it,

522
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,349
I will learn from Hao immediately.

523
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,950
OK.

524
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,709
You are still so sweet.

525
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,709
Young people are indeed of great enthusiasm.

526
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,110
You are also sweet.

527
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,470
Why would you invite me over for dinner today?

528
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,870
I just want to know

529
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,630
how is the company?

530
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,800
Is the news true?

531
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,920
Someone wants to buy "Love Note".

532
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,629
Jiaxin said that we must have a new version.

533
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,040
We may be able to save it.

534
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,280
I want to show you something.

535
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,559
(Daily Sweets)<br>A co-worker asked me

536
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,800
if it is your account.

537
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,320
It gives more valuable tips for living<br>than your official account does.

538
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,800
Hearing your words,<br>I'm relieved.

539
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,950
I want to discuss something with you.

540
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,280
What is it?

541
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,110
I want to make a comeback for you.

542
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,280
What do you think?

543
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,320
Do you still remember

544
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,040
when I was fat in high school?

545
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,950
I was mocked and bullied every day.

546
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,230
It is you who protected me.

547
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,870
Then I met Zhang Hao and got married to him.

548
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,200
He takes good care of me in all aspects.

549
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,350
My first response was<br>escaping when I divorced

550
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,949
and affected the app.

551
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,989
To be honest,

552
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,709
I have avoided facing it for a long time.

553
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,920
I want to be brave this time.

554
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,950
And I also want to protect you once.

555
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,470
Let me do something for you.

556
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,319
Jingjing, but...

557
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,519
Though my impact

558
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,800
is not as great as before.

559
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,159
I still want to help if you need me.

560
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,709
There is strength in numbers.

561
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,870
It's better than you two handling it alone.

562
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,920
I had a conversation with Jingjing<br>before we came here.

563
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,079
I think the real love<br>behind the fake news

564
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,590
of Jingjing and Hao

565
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,279
is very moving.

566
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,159
We can start from this point.

567
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,440
It is good for both<br>Jingjing and us.

568
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,560
Well.

569
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,710
Are you okay with that, Zhang Hao?

570
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:40,950
Of course.

571
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,710
I was self-righteous and<br>made many bad decisions.

572
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,159
It not only created

573
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,159
many blocks in our relationship

574
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,039
but also affected your program.

575
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,230
I will listen to Jingjing.

576
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,079
No matter what she does,

577
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I will stand with her firmly.

578
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,750
Come on.

579
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,349
Difficulties are nothing.

580
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,519
Let's work together!

581
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,519
Come on.

582
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,749
- Come on.<br>- Cheers.

583
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,520
Let's work hard!

(Six-Day Countdown)

585
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,950
I asked you to come here so late

586
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,520
for a discussion.

587
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,630
Now,

588
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,439
we have a chance to save "Love Note".

589
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,709
The premise is that

590
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,830
we need to offer a convincing program

591
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,280
within a week.

592
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,990
It is not easy,

593
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,590
but I still believe in you.

594
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,560
Does anyone want to join?

595
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,709
OK.

596
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,439
Let's finish the impossible task.

597
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,349
Come on.

598
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,349
- Come on.<br>- Come on.

Anna,

613
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,040
what do you think about the plan?

614
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,800
Did you make it within a week?

615
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,559
Yes.

616
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,829
The time is limited,

617
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,560
so there may be many imperfections.

618
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,990
It's OK. Anna.

619
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,800
You can tell us your thoughts.

620
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,710
I want you to explain<br>the theme of the plan first.

621
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
I will tell you a story.

622
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,990
There was a girl who was so good at work

623
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,440
but was bad in love.

624
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,200
<i>She wanted to make "Love Note" work</i>

625
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,989
<i>because she knew there were girls like her</i>

626
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,470
(Task: Not Single. Time Limit: Three Months)<br><i>in the world</i>

627
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,919
<i>who know nothing about love</i>

628
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,080
<i>and need guidance about love.</i>

629
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,829
<i>They think a tool<br>teaching them love tricks</i>

630
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,950
<i>and skills systematically</i>

631
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,830
can tell them the secret of love.

632
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,750
Then

633
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,040
she met a variable in her life.

634
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,950
<i>The impossible love<br>changed into loving her only.</i>

635
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,040
It made her realize that all the tricks and skills

636
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,400
are nothing in front of real love.

637
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,880
Sincerity

638
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,729
is the only path towards love.

639
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,610
The program

640
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,729
is her loving process.

641
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,920
You are the variable, right?

642
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,970
Yes.

643
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,609
We want to make

644
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,489
a new version of the app this time.

645
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,369
It is updated in all aspects.

646
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,329
We will change to mental guidance

647
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,040
from technical guidance.

648
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,569
We add a socializing section to it.

649
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,969
We also revise the algorithm of big data

650
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,609
to change the match-making

651
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,730
from outer conditions to mental appeal.

652
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,369
They can join the matching group

653
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,999
when they have the same preference.

654
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,999
It allows people eager for love

655
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,569
but find it difficult to meet love

656
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,090
to meet the one with the same preference and goal.

657
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,130
To be honest,

658
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,759
the program made within a week

659
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,850
can't meet my criteria.

660
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,680
Welcome.

661
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,040
OK. I will place the order for you.

662
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,280
Sir, here you are.

663
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,849
Sir, I have a secret.

664
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,129
What is it?

665
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,440
I think I may have found the spy of our company.

666
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,130
I happened to see it.

667
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,570
I also have the voice record.

668
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,039
I am about to become the hero

669
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,090
who saves the company.

670
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,799
I have fully understood it

671
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,409
after hearing what you told me last time.

672
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,479
Though my love comes to nothing,<br>I decide to

673
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,410
save Gu Jiaxin for the last time.

674
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,799
Then I will walk away,

675
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,410
which makes him remember me forever.

676
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,889
Don't laugh.

677
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,239
I mean it.

678
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,519
Fortunately, I found the spy.

679
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,279
Otherwise, the company

680
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,609
will be ruined by the two women.

681
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,480
May I listen to your evidence?

682
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,689
I planned to listen to it with Gu Jiaxin.

683
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,410
Since you are eager to do so

684
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,930
and you are one of us.

685
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,199
Okay then.

686
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,760
I will let you listen to it.

687
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,070
(Play)

688
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,850
What did she say?

689
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,170
Come to my office.

690
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,930
What did Anna say?

691
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,720
What did she say?

692
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,649
Hey.

693
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,930
Say something!

694
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,000
Did she turn us down?

695
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,279
Say something!

696
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,569
Why are you in silence?

697
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,800
What did she say?

698
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:57,800
She said

699
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,959
she agreed to let us make a new version.

700
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,609
Really?

701
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,369
Yes, she agreed.

702
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,369
She decided to invest in "Love Note"

703
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,280
and support the revision.

704
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,039
Great!

705
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,960
Let me show you something.

706
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,330
What's this?

707
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,480
It is the same as the previous investigation.

708
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,799
Song Xue is guilty.

709
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,169
She told Anna our<br>financial problem secretly

710
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,199
and encouraged Anna to buy our app

711
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,440
as an internal deal with her.

712
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,090
Did Anna tell you about it?

713
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,799
Though Anna wants to get our program,

714
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,929
she keeps an eye on Song Xue.

715
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,719
Song Xue betrayed the company easily,

716
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,930
so she wouldn't believe in her.

717
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,089
We reach an agreement now.

718
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,480
She told me this as a favor.

719
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,480
This is the record of their communication.

720
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,000
It is the best beginning.

721
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,000
Everything is possible

722
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,200
because of you.

723
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,440
Gu Jiaxin.

724
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,000
What is it?

725
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,570
Wait. Why didn't you knock on the door?

726
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,689
Why don't you hang<br>a Do-Not-Enter sign

727
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,000
when you kiss?

728
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,519
Yanran, do you come to Jiaxin for something?

729
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,570
I suspect Anna and Song Xue cooperate in secret.

730
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,280
There is a spy in the company and it is Song Xue.

731
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,170
Tell me.

732
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,570
I met them in a coffee shop

733
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,520
and I had a voice record.

734
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,330
Though there is no obvious evidence in it...

735
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,889
<i>Did you have painless labor?</i>

736
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:03,929
<i>How is it?</i>

737
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,280
<i>Yes. No one can deny it.</i>

738
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,610
<i>I felt like in heaven within a second.</i>

739
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,889
<i>What does it mean?</i>

740
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,960
<i>I felt less pain</i>

741
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,170
<i>after the injection.</i>

742
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,089
Though I did not record any valid evidence,

743
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,369
I do suspect them.

744
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,960
There are signs.

745
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,849
As soon as the crisis happened,

746
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,279
Song Xue went back to the company

747
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,169
and took Jiangyue's position immediately.

748
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,569
As soon as the crisis happened,

749
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,959
Song Xue went back to the company

750
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,329
and took Ms. Zhao's position immediately.

751
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,369
It's hard not to suspect that

752
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,239
It's hard not to suspect that

753
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,480
she did that in secret.

754
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,370
What's more,<br>why did Anna appear...

755
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,479
Exactly when Jin<br>Yan was in hospital?

756
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,719
What a coincidence.

757
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,649
If Song Xue catches the<br>chance and makes the deal,

758
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,239
she is very likely to...

759
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,569
She is very likely to take over.

760
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,759
As she pleased...

761
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,889
She can control "Love Note" as she pleased.

762
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,239
In a word,<br>Sons Xue is quite suspicious.

763
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,690
I suggest you have a thorough investigation.

764
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,480
Yanran,

765
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,690
great speech.

766
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,610
We have got the evidence.

767
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,570
You have gotten the evidence?

768
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,090
Anna gave it to me

769
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,239
and Jiangyue found

770
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,960
that Song Xue is to be blamed<br>for Qian Jingjing's divorce.

771
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,759
What a black sheep!

772
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,959
Why did she do that?

773
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,200
Ms. Jin is good to her.

774
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,929
<i>Excuse me, I have to go to the restroom.</i>

775
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,570
<i>OK.</i>

776
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,040
<i>Hello.</i>

777
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,690
<i>Why didn't you send the baby to the hospital<br>when he was sick?</i>

778
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,610
He is suffering from a severe cough.

779
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,000
You're busy.

780
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,800
Are you the only one who is busy?

781
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,240
Can't you think more about me?

782
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,039
If you aren't in heavy debt

783
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,930
and become a defaulter,<br>do I have to work?

784
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,930
<i>OK. I get it.</i>

785
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,890
<i>What did I do to deserve this?</i>

786
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,440
A couple of days ago,

787
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,479
I heard from my business partners

788
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,439
that the company of Song Xue's husband

789
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,610
was about to bankrupt.

790
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,480
She had no choice

791
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,370
but came back to the company.

792
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,609
It was her who spared no effort to

793
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,889
marry into the purple.

794
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,200
She made it with her baby.

795
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,999
She is now betraying the company

796
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,330
to obtain personal profit.

797
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,410
I despise her.

798
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,690
In any case,

799
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,890
thank you for your help.

800
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,330
I help you just because...

801
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,649
I will always help when seeing injustice.

802
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,520
I am also a part of the company.

803
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,850
(Murphy's Law of Love)

804
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,720
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

805
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,129
No.

806
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,090
Are you talking about the psychological effect?

807
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,889
If there is a chance to go wrong in something,

808
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,719
it will always happen

809
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,089
no matter how little the chance is.

810
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,239
Yes, it is.

811
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,760
The app said that Murphy's Law also works in love.

812
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:57,930
What does it mean?

813
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,039
When someone wants to cheat,

814
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,630
temptation always appears.

815
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,239
It gets harder to maintain a relationship

816
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,279
when it missed something at the beginning.

817
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,949
Oh my god. It is so correct.

818
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,909
Right?

819
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,999
And this.

820
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,109
A person who is hard to get

821
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,319
will not be with you for a long time

822
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,350
even if you make it.

823
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,950
Really?

824
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,389
Do I need to give up<br>on my Prince Charming?

825
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,719
Don't you change it every day?

826
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,759
No.

827
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,109
Look at this. It is right.

828
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,189
Murphy's Law tells us<br>humans are getting smarter.

829
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,189
But it is never possible for a human

830
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,239
to know about everything in this universe.

831
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,039
Making mistakes easily is<br>a weakness born with us.

832
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,999
In a relationship,

833
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,079
there are things that we can't avoid.

834
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,522
What we can do is to stay true to the original self

835
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:41,682
and cut loss in time.

836
00:42:41,683 --> 00:42:43,482
Well said!
