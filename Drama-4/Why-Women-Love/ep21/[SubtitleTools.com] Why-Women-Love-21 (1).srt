Ms. Zhao?

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,189
Anna.

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,999
What a coincidence!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,639
I didn't expect to meet you here.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,109
Do you come for dinner?

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,910
Yes. Do you want me to join?

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
Come on. Take a seat.

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,319
That will be great. I will join.

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,190
Come on.

39
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,429
Ms. Zhao, would you mind?

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,600
No. Just a meal.

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,320
Little Jiaxin.

42
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,430
Did you consider things that

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,080
I told you?

44
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,760
Jiangyue,<br>I will talk with Anna there for a while.

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,039
I'll be back soon.

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,320
Anna, let's talk over there.

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
Anna, about that...

48
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,429
I have to think about it more.

49
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,199
OK?

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,689

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,269
Bye.

55
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,870
Bye, Anna.

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm sorry, darling.

57
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,920
what's going on?

58
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,679
Why were you talking again?

59
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,759
What do you need to consider?

60
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,870
Just work.

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,839
She wants to cooperate with us.

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,790
We are still working on the details.

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,710
Come on, let's eat.

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,509
Are you angry?

65
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,119
No.

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,349
Let's have dinner.

67
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,120
I will order.

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,270

What's this?

77
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,199
Hello.

78
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,429
Jingjing.

79
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,989
Will you be home tomorrow afternoon?

80
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,920
I've got something to ask you.

81
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,039
Come on.

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,629
This is the afternoon tea I've prepared.

83
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,069
What do you think?

84
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,710
Is it good?

85
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,869
Nice.

86
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,639
You can even make cakes.

87
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,359
What did Zhang Hao do to you?

88
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,359
You silly.

89
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,669
How can I make a cake?

90
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,640
I bought it.

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,919
A waste of my appreciation.

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,549
Come on.

93
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,799
Let's cheer for Ms. Zhao's return to her career.

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,949
Also for her true love.

95
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,869
Congratulation to Little Aunt.

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,760
Thank you.

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,640
How is your long-distance relationship?

98
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,990
Forget it.

99
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,549
It's been 16 days since Qi Heng left. I miss him.

100
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,639
I think you can pay<br>more attention to work

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,949
during these days.

102
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,479
Maybe you can get a promotion<br>and your salary raised.

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,870
You may even reach the peak of your life.

104
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,709
Little Aunt, I feel like quitting.

105
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,519
I want to go to Shenzhen for Qi Heng.

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,600
I don't agree with that.

107
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,269
Giving up everything for love

108
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,039
should be considered.

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,870
You are such a cold woman.

110
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,599
Duoxi, you can't listen to your aunt.

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,709
I have taught her many love skills.

112
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,389
Her relationship only came out of luck.

113
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,829
I want to be as lucky as her.

114
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,150
Then I can do well in both love and career.

115
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,109
Well.

116
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,430
What did you want to ask me last night?

117
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,110
I think

118
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,320
I've had an opponent.

119
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,359
Recently,<br>a woman called Anna appeared.

120
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,989
She seemed to be his ex-girlfriend.

121
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,150
Though Jiaxin explain to me,

122
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
I still feel weird.

123
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,919
Wherever we went, we met her,

124
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,079
and she acted naturally.

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,550
I can't find anything wrong.

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,269
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

127
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,359
What's that?

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,639
In a relationship,

129
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,759
bad things are more likely to happen

130
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,429
the more you worry about it.

131
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,919
If you think Gu Jiaxin cheats on you,

132
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,079
it may be true.

133
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,549
Impossible.

134
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,359
Gu Jiaxin loves Little Aunt so much.

135
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,429
I don't believe it.

136
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,479
Duoxi, you are too naive.

137
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,429
The woman makes Ms. Zhao feel uncomfortable

138
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,319
by doing nothing.

139
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,319
What does it mean?

140
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,270
It means the woman plays her cards well.

141
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,269
Do you have her photo?

142
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,429
Let me have a look.

143
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,990
Here.

144
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,869
She is not easy to deal with.

145
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,549
We met her in the company.

146
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,640
She looks like the<br>chairwoman in a novel.

147
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,670
I suspect

148
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,080
Gu Jiaxin has a preference

149
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,240
for mature women.

150
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,669
I am the mature one

151
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,480
who has spent more time with him.

152
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,520
That's why he likes me.

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,639
Well,<br>you better don't make random guesses

154
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,429
unless you find any evidence.

155
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,269
What should I do?

156
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,669
You should give him more time and hints

157
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,920
to explain it to you.

158
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,760
OK.

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,710
I will think about it.

160
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:17,809
(A meeting with Anna)

161
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,050
(Have lunch with Anna)

162
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,400
(Offline meeting with Anna)

163

(Visit Anna's company)

164
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,240
Darling.

165
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,149
Let's talk about it.

166
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,079
What is it?

167
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,759
It is Motor's birthday today.

168
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,240
I have to join their party.

169
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,110
We can't have dinner together tonight.

170
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,520
OK.

171
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,800
When will you be back?

172
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,479
May be late.

173
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,800
OK. Just go.

174
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,919
I will bring the files to Fen.

175
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,869
Let's go downstairs together.

176
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,480
OK.

177
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,150
(Room 2206 in Aimei Hotel, booking confirmation)

178

Let's go

179

(Aimei Hotel)

180
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,220
Welcome! Sir.

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,119
<i>Gu Jiaxin, you jerk.</i>

182
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,799
<i>A birthday party of your friend?</i>

183
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,830
<i>And you expect me to believe you?</i>

184
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,830
Hello. Gu Jiaxin cheats on me.

185
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,439
I saw him go to a hotel room with a woman.

186
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,559
What?

187
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,599
Where are you?

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,709
I'm in the hotel.

189
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,709
Stay calm first.

190
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,149
I'll be there in a minute.

191
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,389
You must wait for me.

192
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,040
Quickly.

193
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,920
Jiangyue.

194
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,189
Jiangyue.

195
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,799
Don't be impulsive.

196
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,560
Stay calm.

197
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,310
Jiangyue.

198
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,239
I've taken care of the travel plan.

199
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,439
You just need to enjoy the food.

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:12,950
Great.

201
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,189
Jiangyue.

202
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,830
Don't be impulsive.

203
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,629
Jiangyue.

204
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,829
Listen to me.

205
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,600
Close your eyes.

206
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,190
Deep breathe.

207
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,559
Control your emotion.

208
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,480
Don't be impulsive.

209
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,150
I can't stay calm.

210
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,190
Who is it?

211
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,310
Well.

212
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,710
Happy birthday to you.

213
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,599
Happy birthday to you.

214
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,189
Happy birthday to you.

215
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,709
- Happy birthday to you.<br>- Happy birthday to me.

216
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,679
Happy birthday!

217
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,630
- Happy!<br>- Happy!

218
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,830
I arrange this.

219
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,070
Welcome!

220
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,949
Why are you still standing there?

221
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,070
Go somewhere else!

222
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,679
I got it. Let's go, buddies.

223
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,559
We will start the next round of the party.

224
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,999
I will buy you drinks.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,270
OK. Let's go.

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,040
Are you here for his birthday?

227
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,630
I just saw you with Anna<br>downstairs at the hotel.

228
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,629
No way.

229
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,119
Do you think I came for Anna?

230
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,239
Otherwise?

231
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,039
Why would you both be here at the same time?

232
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,150
I'm wronged.

233
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,629
Anna stays in this hotel temporarily<br>after she got back to China.

234
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,800
We just happened to meet each other.

235
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,000
What's the relationship between you?

236
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,359
I heard that she is your ex-girlfriend.

237
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,039
And she is back for you.

238
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,510
Who told you that?

239
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,750
It's fake.

240
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,309
Anna was harassed by a scumbag back then.

241
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,360
I pretended to be her<br>boyfriend and in return,

242
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,679
she did the homework of Economics<br>for me the whole term.

243
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,359
I was busy racing.

244
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,559
So I helped her out of kindness.

245
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,149
Really?

246
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,389
Yes.

247
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,560
Definitely true.

248
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,830
No.

249
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,879
I believe you are hiding something from me.

250
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,390
My sixth sense is always precise.

251
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,000
Well.

252
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,440
I'm hiding something.

253
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,630
But it is not what you think.

254
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,069
It's about the company.

255
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,880
The company?

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,680
What happened?

257
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
After the accident of "Love Note",

258
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,799
the head office met severe financial crisis.

259
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,629
My mom thought about selling "Love Note"

260
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,879
to stop the loss in time.

261
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,559
She appointed me as acting president

262
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,119
to finish the deal.

263
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,830
You must keep the financial status a secret.

264
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,360
There are other companies that want to buy it.

265
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,630
If we fail,

266
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,680
I will sell it to save the headquarter.

267
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,189
I didn't tell you

268
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,600
because I don't want you to be worried.

269
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,799
K. J Capital that Anna represents

270
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,679
knew about it somehow.

271
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,440
She wants to buy it from me.

272
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,389
That's why she keeps contacting me.

273
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,479
To be honest,

274
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,390
the conditions she provides are quite tempting.

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,149
As long as you help me with the deal,

276
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,950
I will invest in your dream.

277
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,190
I know you want the app.

278
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,120
But I can't sell it to you.

279
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,600
Why?

280
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,630
Because of a person.

281
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,680
"Love Note" is her dream.

282
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,270
I want to finish it with her.

283
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,439
We will make a new<br>version of "Love Note".

284
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Please give me more time.

285
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,310
I will show you more<br>potentials of "Love Note".

286
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,070
Well.

287
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,240
If you can show me a persuasive plan,

288
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,150
I will consider your suggestion

289
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,309
after I see its potential.

290
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,630
Why don't you tell me earlier?

291
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,560
I planned to tell you<br>after everything is done.

292
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,510
"Love Note" is your dream.

293
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,750
How could I sell it?

294
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,000
Sorry.

295
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,880
I misunderstood you.

296
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,000
It's OK.

297
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,749
Being jealous is what love is.

298
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,070
It's my pleasure

299
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,119
to have you get jealous because of me.

300
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,189
Annoying.

301
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,040
To be serious,

302
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,240
I have known Anna for years.

303
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,600
She is so realistic.

304
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
And she does so well in business.

305
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,039
She won't do any deal which is not profitable.

306
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,439
So I have been thinking<br>how we can get her

307
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,360
to invest and save "Love Note".

308
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,769
We need to make an unprecedented update

309
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,330
on our app.

310
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,379
I just met Anna

311
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,700
and wanted to talk about this with her.

312
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,580
I agree.

313
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,529
I have been thinking about

314
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,770
how we can update "Love Note".

315
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,059
Let's get back to the company and work on it.

316
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,409
We can discuss it.

317
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,729
I have some new ideas.

318
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,260
OK.

319
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,850
I do like your serious look about work.

320
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,720
(Duoxi)

321
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,969
Hello.

322
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,209
Hello, Little Aunt.

323
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:52,899
Read the article published by the public accounts

324
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,089
which I just sent you.

325
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,329
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)<br>It is said

326
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,380
that "Love Note" may be<br>acquired by K. J Capital.

327
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,940
Is it real?

328
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,089
The news has gone viral in the company's group chat.

329
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,170
People are on tenterhooks.

330
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,969
It is a rumor.

331
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,899
I will hold a meeting<br>and tell everyone about that.

332
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,450
No worries.

333
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,180
What happened?

334
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,570
Look at this.

335
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,850
Did Anna leak it?

336
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,420
I think it is possible.

337
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,090
Trust me.

338
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,930
We will not lose.

339
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,090
Mom.

340
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,900
I can't sell "Love Note".

341
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,779
Why?

342
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,779
Because it is what Zhao Jiangyue and all staff

343
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,540
have worked so hard for.

344
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,660
You protected the dream of your lover.

345
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,180
I also want to protect Zhao Jiangyue's dream.

346
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,019
Do you believe in the news?

347
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,050
Is "Love Note" going to be purchased?

348
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,330
Will we have a new boss?

349
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,849
You don't need to worry about that.

350
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,729
The company is not going to go bankrupt.

351
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,299
Right?

352
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,089
Even though the boss is changed,

353
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,139
we still need to work.

354
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,019
It won't be the same.

355
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,729
If it was purchased,

356
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,419
the company's structure would be reorganized.

357
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,689
We have no idea what will happen.

358
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,969
Stopping worrying.

359
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,209
Ms. Zhao said that she will tell us

360
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,259
in the meeting later.

361
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,730
We can ask her when she is here.

362
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,299
Ms. Zhao.

363
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,779
- Ms. Zhao.<br>- Ms. Zhao.

364
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,089
What happened?

365
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,969
-Ms. Zhao<br>-Jiaxin.

366
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,779
What happened?

367
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,019
Is the company going to be acquired?

368
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,299
- Right?<br>- Will it be acquired?

369
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,180
Don't worry.

370
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,969
To be honest,<br>"Love Note" is facing some crisis.

371
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,900
But it is not that serious, we will not lose it.

372
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,659
Everyone spent<br>great effort on the app.

373
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,300
I hope we can work together in the future.

374
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,659
Ms. Zhao.

375
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,380
We are relieved with your words.

376
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,619
Ms. Zhao,<br>"Love Note" is yours as well as ours.

377
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,179
We would like to go through thick and thin for it.

378
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,089
If you need us, just tell us.

379
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,019
No matter what happens,

380
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,900
we will go through thick and thin for it.

381
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:27,659
Right!

382
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,449
Let's work together.

383
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,849
Cheer up!

384
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,620
No worries.

385
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,779
I promise on my reputation

386
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,730
that "Love Note" will not be bought easily.

387
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,779
OK.

388
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,379
Well. Let's work!

389
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,659
OK.

390
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,020
Let's go.

391
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,019
Anna, did you send the news?

392
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,139
The news of the acquisition?

393
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,779
I thought we reached an agreement

394
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,780
that you'd give me more time.

395
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,659
Acquisition is probably not the best way.

396
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,449
Jiaxin, believe it or not.

397
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,090
It was not from me.

398
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,970
But

399
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,779
I don't mind the reactions of the market.

400
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,139
You know I work to<br>make money by money.

401
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,539
Capital comes with a cost.

402
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,729
I will not mix friends and business.

403
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,619
I would like to trust you as a friend.

404
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,970
But as a business partner,

405
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,689
it is hard for me to believe

406
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,659
a new worker can solve such a knotty problem

407
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,380
in a short time.

408
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,850
Anna.

409
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,900
I will show you a plan that satisfies you.

410
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,660
Easier said than done.

411
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,540
I will give you one more week.

412
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,849
If you still can't provide a good enough plan,

413
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,019
I'll discuss the details<br>of the acquisition with Ms. Jin

414
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,660
without notifying you.

415
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,090
Anna.

416
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,260
Don't worry.

417
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,419
I will give you the plan this week.

418
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,540
You can talk to Anna first.

419
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,209
In the news,<br>I saw lots of financial information

420
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,019
which hasn't even been publicized

421
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,659
within the company.

422
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,260
It is not what Anna can get.

423
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Is there a spy?

424
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:41,300
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)

425
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,419
How could this happen?

426
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,619
What's wrong, darling?

427
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,780
Why are you sighing?

428
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,300
Read the news.

429
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,780
What should we do?

430
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,142
Ms. Zhao.

431
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,930
See what I just found.

432
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,730
What?

433
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,089
I watched all the videos on this account.

434
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,259
I think she is Qian Jingjing.

435
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,689
Some fans also comment below

436
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,780
that it is her alternate account.

437
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,449
It does look like Qian Jingjing's apartment.

438
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,849
We are making a new version of the app.

439
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,619
Can we catch people's attention

440
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,539
with the current situation

441
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,020
of Qian Jingjing and Zhang Hao?

442
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,779
Ms. Zhao. Jiaxin...

443
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,540
No. Mr. Gu asked you to go to his office.

444
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,780
OK.

445
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,259
I don't want to hype Qian Jingjing.

446
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,660
Let's find some new ideas.

447
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,420
Sorry.

448
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,620
Can you be careful next time?

449
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,059

(Blueberry Entertainment)<br>(Qian Jingjing's Divorce)

451
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,299
<i>Isn't it the gossip media</i>

452
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,500
<i>that discloses the news of Jingjing's divorce?</i>

453
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,020
Here you are.

454
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,090
What happened?

455
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,329
Jingjing just called

456
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,660
and asked us to have dinner at their home.

457
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,140
OK.

458
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,090
What's wrong?

459
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,930
Little Gu,<br>could you also be this worried?

460
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,300
It is so hard to be a domineering president.

461
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,260
Anything is easy.

462
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,810
Didn't you suggest I be confident yesterday?

463
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,809
Why do you get cold feet today?

464
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,810
I don't.

465
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,570
I just

466
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,140
don't want to let you down.

467
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,420
Why would you think that?

468
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,540
I want to be the one<br>who you can rely on.

469
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,179
I also want to spare no effort

470
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,500
to solve the issues of the company.

471
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,690
But I am afraid that I can't do it well.

472
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,260
I have been thinking about

473
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,620
what I would do if I<br>were Xu Ningyuan.

474
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,500
I can't figure it out.

475
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,050
What nonsense are you talking about?

476
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,850
How can you be so harsh?

477
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,540
I am telling you,

478
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,450
you are unique.

479
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,569
I chose to be with you because you are Gu Jiaxin.

480
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,969
No one can replace you.

481
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,810
Do you know?

482
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,420
The bigger the responsibility you take,<br>the greater the pressure is.

483
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,330
No worries.

484
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,900
I will always be with you.

485
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,660
Yueyue,

486
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,780
I'm lucky to meet you.

487
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,420
Well. Alright, alright.

488
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,089
I have something want to tell you.

489
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,730
Go ahead.

490
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,730
I met Song Xue on my way here.

491
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,620
She dropped a business card.

492
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,929
Isn't it the media

493
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,810
that exposes the news of Qian Jingjing's divorce?

494
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,539
If Song Xue is the backstage manipulator,

495
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,970
she is not doing it<br>only to ruin Jingjing.

496
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,930
What do you mean?

497
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,810
The exposure of the divorce

498
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,540
hurts both Jingjing and our app.

499
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,689
We must investigate her.

500
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,180
OK.

501
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,140
You focus on the plan

502
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,140
and I will pay more attention to Song Xue.

503
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,449
Are you hungry?

504
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,260
Yes.

505
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,299
- Finally!<br>- Jingjing.

506
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,049
Come in.

507
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,969
Jiaxin.

508
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,089
- Come in.<br>- Jingjing.

509
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,619
I bring two bottles of wine for you and Hao.

510
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,539
It's Guangliang Wine.

511
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,659
Simple but sincere.

512
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,299
Thank you.

513
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,969
Come on. Welcome.

514
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,729
- Come on, sit down.<br>- Sit down.

515
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,379
The dinner starts as soon as we arrive.

516
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,689
The main dish will come later.

517
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,690
You can talk while having dinner.

518
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,539
Please try the dishes made by Zhang Hao.

519
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,929
Look at Zhang Hao.

520
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,449
Gu Jiaxin always orders<br>deliveries for me only.

521
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,780
As long as you like it,

522
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,449
I will learn from Hao immediately.

523
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,050
OK.

524
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,809
You are still so sweet.

525
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,809
Young people are indeed of great enthusiasm.

526
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,210
You are also sweet.

527
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,570
Why would you invite me over for dinner today?

528
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,970
I just want to know

529
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,730
how is the company?

530
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,900
Is the news true?

531
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,020
Someone wants to buy "Love Note".

532
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,729
Jiaxin said that we must have a new version.

533
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,140
We may be able to save it.

534
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,380
I want to show you something.

535
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,659
(Daily Sweets)<br>A co-worker asked me

536
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,900
if it is your account.

537
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,420
It gives more valuable tips for living<br>than your official account does.

538
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,900
Hearing your words,<br>I'm relieved.

539
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,050
I want to discuss something with you.

540
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,380
What is it?

541
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,210
I want to make a comeback for you.

542
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,380
What do you think?

543
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,420
Do you still remember

544
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,140
when I was fat in high school?

545
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,050
I was mocked and bullied every day.

546
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,330
It is you who protected me.

547
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,970
Then I met Zhang Hao and got married to him.

548
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,300
He takes good care of me in all aspects.

549
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,450
My first response was<br>escaping when I divorced

550
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,049
and affected the app.

551
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,089
To be honest,

552
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,809
I have avoided facing it for a long time.

553
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,020
I want to be brave this time.

554
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,050
And I also want to protect you once.

555
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,570
Let me do something for you.

556
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,419
Jingjing, but...

557
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,619
Though my impact

558
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,900
is not as great as before.

559
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,259
I still want to help if you need me.

560
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,809
There is strength in numbers.

561
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,970
It's better than you two handling it alone.

562
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,020
I had a conversation with Jingjing<br>before we came here.

563
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,179
I think the real love<br>behind the fake news

564
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,690
of Jingjing and Hao

565
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,379
is very moving.

566
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,259
We can start from this point.

567
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,540
It is good for both<br>Jingjing and us.

568
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,660
Well.

569
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,810
Are you okay with that, Zhang Hao?

570
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,050
Of course.

571
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,810
I was self-righteous and<br>made many bad decisions.

572
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,259
It not only created

573
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,259
many blocks in our relationship

574
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,139
but also affected your program.

575
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,330
I will listen to Jingjing.

576
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,179
No matter what she does,

577
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I will stand with her firmly.

578
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:01,850
Come on.

579
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,449
Difficulties are nothing.

580
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,619

581
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,619
Come on.

582
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,849
- Come on.<br>- Cheers.

583
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,620
Let's work hard!

585
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,050
I asked you to come here so late

586
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,620
for a discussion.

587
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,730
Now,

588
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,539
we have a chance to save "Love Note".

589
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,809
The premise is that

590
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,930
we need to offer a convincing program

591
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,380
within a week.

592
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,090
It is not easy,

593
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,690
but I still believe in you.

594
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,660
Does anyone want to join?

595
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,809
OK.

596
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,539
Let's finish the impossible task.

597
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,449
Come on.

598
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,449
- Come on.<br>- Come on.

Anna,

613
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,140
what do you think about the plan?

614
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,900
Did you make it within a week?

615
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,659
Yes.

616
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,929
The time is limited,

617
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,660
so there may be many imperfections.

618
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,090
It's OK. Anna.

619
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,900
You can tell us your thoughts.

620
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,810
I want you to explain<br>the theme of the plan first.

621
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,020
I will tell you a story.

622
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,090
There was a girl who was so good at work

623
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,540
but was bad in love.

624
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,300
<i>She wanted to make "Love Note" work</i>

625
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,089
<i>because she knew there were girls like her</i>

626
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,570
(Task: Not Single. Time Limit: Three Months)<br><i>in the world</i>

627
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,019
<i>who know nothing about love</i>

628
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,180
<i>and need guidance about love.</i>

629
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,929
<i>They think a tool<br>teaching them love tricks</i>

630
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,050
<i>and skills systematically</i>

631
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,930
can tell them the secret of love.

632
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,850
Then

633
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,140
she met a variable in her life.

634
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:37,050
<i>The impossible love<br>changed into loving her only.</i>

635
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,140
It made her realize that all the tricks and skills

636
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,500
are nothing in front of real love.

637
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,980
Sincerity

638
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,829
is the only path towards love.

639
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,710
The program

640
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,829
is her loving process.

641
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,020
You are the variable, right?

642
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,070
Yes.

643
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,709
We want to make

644
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,589
a new version of the app this time.

645
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,469
It is updated in all aspects.

646
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,429
We will change to mental guidance

647
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,140
from technical guidance.

648
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,669
We add a socializing section to it.

649
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,069
We also revise the algorithm of big data

650
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,709
to change the match-making

651
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,830
from outer conditions to mental appeal.

652
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,469
They can join the matching group

653
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,099
when they have the same preference.

654
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,099
It allows people eager for love

655
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,669
but find it difficult to meet love

656
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,190
to meet the one with the same preference and goal.

657
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,230
To be honest,

658
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,859
the program made within a week

659
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,950
can't meet my criteria.

660
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,780
Welcome.

661
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,140
OK. I will place the order for you.

662
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,380
Sir, here you are.

663
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,949
Sir, I have a secret.

664
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,229
What is it?

665
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,540
I think I may have found the spy of our company.

666
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,230
I happened to see it.

667
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,670
I also have the voice record.

668
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,139
I am about to become the hero

669
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,190
who saves the company.

670
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,899
I have fully understood it

671
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,509
after hearing what you told me last time.

672
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,579
Though my love comes to nothing,<br>I decide to

673
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,510
save Gu Jiaxin for the last time.

674
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,899
Then I will walk away,

675
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,510
which makes him remember me forever.

676
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,989
Don't laugh.

677
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,339
I mean it.

678
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,619
Fortunately, I found the spy.

679
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,379
Otherwise, the company

680
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,709
will be ruined by the two women.

681
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,580
May I listen to your evidence?

682
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,789
I planned to listen to it with Gu Jiaxin.

683
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,510
Since you are eager to do so

684
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,030
and you are one of us.

685
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,299
Okay then.

686
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,860
I will let you listen to it.

687
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,170
(Play)

688
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,950
What did she say?

689
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,270
Come to my office.

690
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,030
What did Anna say?

691
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,820
What did she say?

692
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,749
Hey.

693
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,030
Say something!

694
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,100
Did she turn us down?

695
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,379
Say something!

696
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,669
Why are you in silence?

697
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,900
What did she say?

698
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,900
She said

699
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,059
she agreed to let us make a new version.

700
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,709
Really?

701
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,469
Yes, she agreed.

702
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,469
She decided to invest in "Love Note"

703
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,380
and support the revision.

704
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,139
Great!

705
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,060
Let me show you something.

706
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,430
What's this?

707
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,580
It is the same as the previous investigation.

708
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,899
Song Xue is guilty.

709
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,269
She told Anna our<br>financial problem secretly

710
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,299
and encouraged Anna to buy our app

711
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,540
as an internal deal with her.

712
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,190
Did Anna tell you about it?

713
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,899
Though Anna wants to get our program,

714
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,029
she keeps an eye on Song Xue.

715
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,819
Song Xue betrayed the company easily,

716
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,030
so she wouldn't believe in her.

717
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,189
We reach an agreement now.

718
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,580
She told me this as a favor.

719
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,580
This is the record of their communication.

720
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,100
It is the best beginning.

721
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,100
Everything is possible

722
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,300
because of you.

723
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,540
Gu Jiaxin.

724
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,100
What is it?

725
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,670
Wait. Why didn't you knock on the door?

726
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,789
Why don't you hang<br>a Do-Not-Enter sign

727
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,100
when you kiss?

728
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,619
Yanran, do you come to Jiaxin for something?

729
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,670
I suspect Anna and Song Xue cooperate in secret.

730
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,380
There is a spy in the company and it is Song Xue.

731
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,270
Tell me.

732
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,670
I met them in a coffee shop

733
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,620
and I had a voice record.

734
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,430
Though there is no obvious evidence in it...

735
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,989
<i>Did you have painless labor?</i>

736
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,029
<i>How is it?</i>

737
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,380
<i>Yes. No one can deny it.</i>

738
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,710
<i>I felt like in heaven within a second.</i>

739
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,989
<i>What does it mean?</i>

740
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,060
<i>I felt less pain</i>

741
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,270
<i>after the injection.</i>

742
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,189
Though I did not record any valid evidence,

743
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,469
I do suspect them.

744
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,060
There are signs.

745
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,949
As soon as the crisis happened,

746
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,379
Song Xue went back to the company

747
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,269
and took Jiangyue's position immediately.

748
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,669
As soon as the crisis happened,

749
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,059
Song Xue went back to the company

750
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,429
and took Ms. Zhao's position immediately.

751
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,469
It's hard not to suspect that

752
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,339
It's hard not to suspect that

753
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,580
she did that in secret.

754
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,470
What's more,<br>why did Anna appear...

755
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,579
Exactly when Jin<br>Yan was in hospital?

756
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,819
What a coincidence.

757
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,749
If Song Xue catches the<br>chance and makes the deal,

758
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,339
she is very likely to...

759
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,669
She is very likely to take over.

760
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,859
As she pleased...

761
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,989
She can control "Love Note" as she pleased.

762
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,339
In a word,<br>Sons Xue is quite suspicious.

763
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,790
I suggest you have a thorough investigation.

764
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,580
Yanran,

765
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,790
great speech.

766
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,710
We have got the evidence.

767
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,670
You have gotten the evidence?

768
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,190
Anna gave it to me

769
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,339
and Jiangyue found

770
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,060
that Song Xue is to be blamed<br>for Qian Jingjing's divorce.

771
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,859
What a black sheep!

772
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,059
Why did she do that?

773
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,300
Ms. Jin is good to her.

774
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,029
<i>Excuse me, I have to go to the restroom.</i>

775
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,670
<i>OK.</i>

776
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,140
<i>Hello.</i>

777
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,790
<i>Why didn't you send the baby to the hospital<br>when he was sick?</i>

778
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,710
He is suffering from a severe cough.

779
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,100
You're busy.

780
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,900
Are you the only one who is busy?

781
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,340
Can't you think more about me?

782
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,139
If you aren't in heavy debt

783
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,030
and become a defaulter,<br>do I have to work?

784
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,030
<i>OK. I get it.</i>

785
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,990
<i>What did I do to deserve this?</i>

786
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,540
A couple of days ago,

787
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,579
I heard from my business partners

788
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,539
that the company of Song Xue's husband

789
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,710
was about to bankrupt.

790
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,580
She had no choice

791
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,470
but came back to the company.

792
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,709
It was her who spared no effort to

793
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,989
marry into the purple.

794
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,300
She made it with her baby.

795
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,099
She is now betraying the company

796
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,430
to obtain personal profit.

797
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,510
I despise her.

798
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,790
In any case,

799
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,990
thank you for your help.

800
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,430
I help you just because...

801
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,749
I will always help when seeing injustice.

802
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,620
I am also a part of the company.

803
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,950
(Murphy's Law of Love)

804
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,820
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

805
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,229
No.

806
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,190
Are you talking about the psychological effect?

807
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,989
If there is a chance to go wrong in something,

808
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,819
it will always happen

809
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,189
no matter how little the chance is.

810
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,339
Yes, it is.

811
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,860
The app said that Murphy's Law also works in love.

812
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,030
What does it mean?

813
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,139
When someone wants to cheat,

814
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,730
temptation always appears.

815
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,339
It gets harder to maintain a relationship

816
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,379
when it missed something at the beginning.

817
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,049
Oh my god. It is so correct.

818
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,009
Right?

819
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,099
And this.

820
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,209
A person who is hard to get

821
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,419
will not be with you for a long time

822
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,450
even if you make it.

823
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,050
Really?

824
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,489
Do I need to give up<br>on my Prince Charming?

825
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,819
Don't you change it every day?

826
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,859
No.

827
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,209
Look at this. It is right.

828
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,289
Murphy's Law tells us<br>humans are getting smarter.

829
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,289
But it is never possible for a human

830
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,339
to know about everything in this universe.

831
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,139
Making mistakes easily is<br>a weakness born with us.

832
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,099
In a relationship,

833
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,179
there are things that we can't avoid.

834
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,622
What we can do is to stay true to the original self

835
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:41,782
and cut loss in time.

836
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:43,582
Well said!

837
