Ms. Zhao?

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,389
Anna.

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,199
What a coincidence!

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,839
I didn't expect to meet you here.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,309
Do you come for dinner?

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,110
Yes. Do you want me to join?

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,160
Come on. Take a seat.

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,519
That will be great. I will join.

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,390
Come on.

39
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,629
Ms. Zhao, would you mind?

40
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,800
No. Just a meal.

41
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,520
Little Jiaxin.

42
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,630
Did you consider things that

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
I told you?

44
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,960
Jiangyue,<br>I will talk with Anna there for a while.

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,239
I'll be back soon.

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,520
Anna, let's talk over there.

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,240
Anna, about that...

48
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,629
I have to think about it more.

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,399
OK?

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,889

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,469
Bye.

55
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,070
Bye, Anna.

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm sorry, darling.

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
what's going on?

58
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,879
Why were you talking again?

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,959
What do you need to consider?

60
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,070
Just work.

61
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,039
She wants to cooperate with us.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,990
We are still working on the details.

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,910
Come on, let's eat.

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,709
Are you angry?

65
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,319
No.

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,549
Let's have dinner.

67
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,320
I will order.

68

77
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,399
Hello.

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,629
Jingjing.

79
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,189
Will you be home tomorrow afternoon?

80
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,120
I've got something to ask you.

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,239
Come on.

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,829
This is the afternoon tea I've prepared.

83
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,269
What do you think?

84
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,910
Is it good?

85
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,069
Nice.

86
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,839
You can even make cakes.

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,559
What did Zhang Hao do to you?

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,559
You silly.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,869
How can I make a cake?

90
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,840
I bought it.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,119
A waste of my appreciation.

92
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,749
Come on.

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,999
Let's cheer for Ms. Zhao's return to her career.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,149
Also for her true love.

95
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,069
Congratulation to Little Aunt.

96
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,960
Thank you.

97
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
How is your long-distance relationship?

98
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,190
Forget it.

99
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,749
It's been 16 days since Qi Heng left. I miss him.

100
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,839
I think you can pay<br>more attention to work

101
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,149
during these days.

102
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,679
Maybe you can get a promotion<br>and your salary raised.

103
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,070
You may even reach the peak of your life.

104
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,909
Little Aunt, I feel like quitting.

105
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,719
I want to go to Shenzhen for Qi Heng.

106
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
I don't agree with that.

107
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,469
Giving up everything for love

108
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,239
should be considered.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,070
You are such a cold woman.

110
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,799
Duoxi, you can't listen to your aunt.

111
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,909
I have taught her many love skills.

112
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,589
Her relationship only came out of luck.

113
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,029
I want to be as lucky as her.

114
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,350
Then I can do well in both love and career.

115
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,309
Well.

116
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,630
What did you want to ask me last night?

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,310
I think

118
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,520
I've had an opponent.

119
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,559
Recently,<br>a woman called Anna appeared.

120
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,189
She seemed to be his ex-girlfriend.

121
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,350
Though Jiaxin explain to me,

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
I still feel weird.

123
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,119
Wherever we went, we met her,

124
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,279
and she acted naturally.

125
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,750
I can't find anything wrong.

126
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,469
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

127
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,559
What's that?

128
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,839
In a relationship,

129
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,959
bad things are more likely to happen

130
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,629
the more you worry about it.

131
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,119
If you think Gu Jiaxin cheats on you,

132
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,279
it may be true.

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,749
Impossible.

134
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,559
Gu Jiaxin loves Little Aunt so much.

135
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,629
I don't believe it.

136
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,679
Duoxi, you are too naive.

137
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,629
The woman makes Ms. Zhao feel uncomfortable

138
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,519
by doing nothing.

139
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,519
What does it mean?

140
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,470
It means the woman plays her cards well.

141
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,469
Do you have her photo?

142
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,629
Let me have a look.

143
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,190
Here.

144
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,069
She is not easy to deal with.

145
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,749
We met her in the company.

146
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,840
She looks like the<br>chairwoman in a novel.

147
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,870
I suspect

148
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
Gu Jiaxin has a preference

149
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,440
for mature women.

150
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,869
I am the mature one

151
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,680
who has spent more time with him.

152
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
That's why he likes me.

153
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,839
Well,<br>you better don't make random guesses

154
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,629
unless you find any evidence.

155
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,469
What should I do?

156
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,869
You should give him more time and hints

157
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,120
to explain it to you.

158
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,960
OK.

159
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,910
I will think about it.

160
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:18,009
(A meeting with Anna)

161
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,250
(Have lunch with Anna)

162

(Visit Anna's company)

164
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,440
Darling.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,349
Let's talk about it.

166
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,279
What is it?

167
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,959
It is Motor's birthday today.

168
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,440
I have to join their party.

169
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,310
We can't have dinner together tonight.

170
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,720
OK.

171
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,000
When will you be back?

172
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,679
May be late.

173
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,000
OK. Just go.

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,119
I will bring the files to Fen.

175
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,069
Let's go downstairs together.

176
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,680
OK.

177
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,350
(Room 2206 in Aimei Hotel, booking confirmation)

(Aimei Hotel)

180
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,420
Welcome! Sir.

181
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,319
<i>Gu Jiaxin, you jerk.</i>

182
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,999

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,030
<i>And you expect me to believe you?</i>

184
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,030
Hello. Gu Jiaxin cheats on me.

185
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,639
I saw him go to a hotel room with a woman.

186
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,759
What?

187
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,799
Where are you?

188
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,909
I'm in the hotel.

189
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,909
Stay calm first.

190
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,349
I'll be there in a minute.

191
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,589
You must wait for me.

192
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,240
Quickly.

193
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,120
Jiangyue.

194
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,389
Jiangyue.

195
00:10:59,390 --> 00:10:59,999
Don't be impulsive.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,760
Stay calm.

197
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,510
Jiangyue.

198
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,439
I've taken care of the travel plan.

199
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,639
You just need to enjoy the food.

200
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,150
Great.

201
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,389
Jiangyue.

202
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,030
Don't be impulsive.

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,829
Jiangyue.

204
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,029
Listen to me.

205
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,800
Close your eyes.

206
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,390
Deep breathe.

207
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,759
Control your emotion.

208
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,680
Don't be impulsive.

209
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,350
I can't stay calm.

210
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,390
Who is it?

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,510
Well.

212
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,910
Happy birthday to you.

213
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,799
Happy birthday to you.

214
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,389
Happy birthday to you.

215
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,909
- Happy birthday to you.<br>- Happy birthday to me.

216
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,879
Happy birthday!

217
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,830
- Happy!<br>- Happy!

218
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,030
I arrange this.

219
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,270
Welcome!

220
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,149
Why are you still standing there?

221
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,270
Go somewhere else!

222
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,879
I got it. Let's go, buddies.

223
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,759
We will start the next round of the party.

224
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,199
I will buy you drinks.

225
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,470
OK. Let's go.

226
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,240
Are you here for his birthday?

227
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,830
I just saw you with Anna<br>downstairs at the hotel.

228
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,829
No way.

229
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,319
Do you think I came for Anna?

230
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,439
Otherwise?

231
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,239
Why would you both be here at the same time?

232
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,350
I'm wronged.

233
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,829
Anna stays in this hotel temporarily<br>after she got back to China.

234
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,000
We just happened to meet each other.

235
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
What's the relationship between you?

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,559
I heard that she is your ex-girlfriend.

237
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,239
And she is back for you.

238
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,710
Who told you that?

239
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,950
It's fake.

240
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,509
Anna was harassed by a scumbag back then.

241
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,560
I pretended to be her<br>boyfriend and in return,

242
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,879
she did the homework of Economics<br>for me the whole term.

243
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,559
I was busy racing.

244
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,759
So I helped her out of kindness.

245
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,349
Really?

246
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,589
Yes.

247
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,760
Definitely true.

248
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,030
No.

249
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,079
I believe you are hiding something from me.

250
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,590
My sixth sense is always precise.

251
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,200
Well.

252
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm hiding something.

253
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,830
But it is not what you think.

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,269
It's about the company.

255
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,080
The company?

256
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,880
What happened?

257
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,000
After the accident of "Love Note",

258
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,999
the head office met severe financial crisis.

259
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,829
My mom thought about selling "Love Note"

260
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,079
to stop the loss in time.

261
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,759
She appointed me as acting president

262
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,319
to finish the deal.

263
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,030
You must keep the financial status a secret.

264
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,560
There are other companies that want to buy it.

265
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,830
If we fail,

266
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,880
I will sell it to save the headquarter.

267
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,389
I didn't tell you

268
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,800
because I don't want you to be worried.

269
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,999
K. J Capital that Anna represents

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,879
knew about it somehow.

271
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
She wants to buy it from me.

272
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,589
That's why she keeps contacting me.

273
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,679
To be honest,

274
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,590
the conditions she provides are quite tempting.

275
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,349
As long as you help me with the deal,

276
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,150
I will invest in your dream.

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,390
I know you want the app.

278
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,320
But I can't sell it to you.

279
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,800
Why?

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,830
Because of a person.

281
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,880
"Love Note" is her dream.

282
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,470
I want to finish it with her.

283
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,639
We will make a new<br>version of "Love Note".

284
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Please give me more time.

285
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,510
I will show you more<br>potentials of "Love Note".

286
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,270
Well.

287
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,440
If you can show me a persuasive plan,

288
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,350
I will consider your suggestion

289
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,509
after I see its potential.

290
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,830
Why don't you tell me earlier?

291
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,760
I planned to tell you<br>after everything is done.

292
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,710
"Love Note" is your dream.

293
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,950
How could I sell it?

294
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,200
Sorry.

295
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,080
I misunderstood you.

296
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,200
It's OK.

297
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,949
Being jealous is what love is.

298
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,270
It's my pleasure

299
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,319
to have you get jealous because of me.

300
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,389
Annoying.

301
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,240
To be serious,

302
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,440
I have known Anna for years.

303
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,800
She is so realistic.

304
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,320
And she does so well in business.

305
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,239
She won't do any deal which is not profitable.

306
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,639
So I have been thinking<br>how we can get her

307
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,560
to invest and save "Love Note".

308
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,969
We need to make an unprecedented update

309
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,530
on our app.

310
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,579
I just met Anna

311
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,900
and wanted to talk about this with her.

312
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,780
I agree.

313
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,729
I have been thinking about

314
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,970
how we can update "Love Note".

315
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,259
Let's get back to the company and work on it.

316
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,609
We can discuss it.

317
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,929
I have some new ideas.

318
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,460
OK.

319
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,050
I do like your serious look about work.

320
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,920
(Duoxi)

321
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,169
Hello.

322
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,409
Hello, Little Aunt.

323
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,099
Read the article published by the public accounts

324
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,289
which I just sent you.

325
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,529
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)<br>It is said

326
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,580
that "Love Note" may be<br>acquired by K. J Capital.

327
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,140
Is it real?

328
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,289
The news has gone viral in the company's group chat.

329
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,370
People are on tenterhooks.

330
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,169
It is a rumor.

331
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,099
I will hold a meeting<br>and tell everyone about that.

332
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,650
No worries.

333
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,380
What happened?

334
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,770
Look at this.

335
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,050
Did Anna leak it?

336
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,620
I think it is possible.

337
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,290
Trust me.

338
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,130
We will not lose.

339
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,290
Mom.

340
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,100
I can't sell "Love Note".

341
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,979
Why?

342
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,979
Because it is what Zhao Jiangyue and all staff

343
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,740
have worked so hard for.

344
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,860
You protected the dream of your lover.

345
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,380
I also want to protect Zhao Jiangyue's dream.

346
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,219
Do you believe in the news?

347
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,250
Is "Love Note" going to be purchased?

348
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,530
Will we have a new boss?

349
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,049
You don't need to worry about that.

350
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,929
The company is not going to go bankrupt.

351
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,499
Right?

352
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,289
Even though the boss is changed,

353
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,339
we still need to work.

354
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,219
It won't be the same.

355
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,929
If it was purchased,

356
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,619
the company's structure would be reorganized.

357
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,889
We have no idea what will happen.

358
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,169
Stopping worrying.

359
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,409
Ms. Zhao said that she will tell us

360
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,459
in the meeting later.

361
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,930
We can ask her when she is here.

362
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,499
Ms. Zhao.

363
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,979
- Ms. Zhao.<br>- Ms. Zhao.

364
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,289
What happened?

365
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,169
-Ms. Zhao<br>-Jiaxin.

366
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,979
What happened?

367
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,219
Is the company going to be acquired?

368
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,499
- Right?<br>- Will it be acquired?

369
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,380
Don't worry.

370
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,169
To be honest,<br>"Love Note" is facing some crisis.

371
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,100
But it is not that serious, we will not lose it.

372
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,859
Everyone spent<br>great effort on the app.

373
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,500
I hope we can work together in the future.

374
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,859
Ms. Zhao.

375
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,580
We are relieved with your words.

376
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,819
Ms. Zhao,<br>"Love Note" is yours as well as ours.

377
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,379
We would like to go through thick and thin for it.

378
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,289
If you need us, just tell us.

379
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,219
No matter what happens,

380
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,100
we will go through thick and thin for it.

381
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:27,859
Right!

382
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,649
Let's work together.

383
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,049
Cheer up!

384
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,820
No worries.

385
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,979
I promise on my reputation

386
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,930
that "Love Note" will not be bought easily.

387
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,979
OK.

388
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,579
Well. Let's work!

389
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,859
OK.

390
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,220
Let's go.

391
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,219
Anna, did you send the news?

392
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,339
The news of the acquisition?

393
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,979
I thought we reached an agreement

394
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
that you'd give me more time.

395
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,859
Acquisition is probably not the best way.

396
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,649
Jiaxin, believe it or not.

397
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,290
It was not from me.

398
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,170
But

399
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,979
I don't mind the reactions of the market.

400
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,339
You know I work to<br>make money by money.

401
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,739
Capital comes with a cost.

402
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,929
I will not mix friends and business.

403
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,819
I would like to trust you as a friend.

404
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,170
But as a business partner,

405
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,889
it is hard for me to believe

406
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,859
a new worker can solve such a knotty problem

407
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,580
in a short time.

408
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,050
Anna.

409
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,100
I will show you a plan that satisfies you.

410
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,860
Easier said than done.

411
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,740
I will give you one more week.

412
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,049
If you still can't provide a good enough plan,

413
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,219
I'll discuss the details<br>of the acquisition with Ms. Jin

414
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,860
without notifying you.

415
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,290
Anna.

416
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,460
Don't worry.

417
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,619
I will give you the plan this week.

418
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,740
You can talk to Anna first.

419
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,409
In the news,<br>I saw lots of financial information

420
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,219
which hasn't even been publicized

421
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,859
within the company.

422
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,460
It is not what Anna can get.

423
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Is there a spy?

424
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:41,500
(Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link)

425
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,619
How could this happen?

426
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,819
What's wrong, darling?

427
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,980
Why are you sighing?

428
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,500
Read the news.

429
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,980
What should we do?

430
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:55,342
Ms. Zhao.

431
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,130
See what I just found.

432
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,930
What?

433
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,289
I watched all the videos on this account.

434
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,459
I think she is Qian Jingjing.

435
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,889
Some fans also comment below

436
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,980
that it is her alternate account.

437
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,649
It does look like Qian Jingjing's apartment.

438
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,049
We are making a new version of the app.

439
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,819
Can we catch people's attention

440
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,739
with the current situation

441
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,220
of Qian Jingjing and Zhang Hao?

442
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,979
Ms. Zhao. Jiaxin...

443
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,740
No. Mr. Gu asked you to go to his office.

444
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,980
OK.

445
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,459
I don't want to hype Qian Jingjing.

446
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,860
Let's find some new ideas.

447
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,620
Sorry.

448
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,820
Can you be careful next time?

449
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,259

(Blueberry Entertainment)<br>(Qian Jingjing's Divorce)

451
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,499
<i>Isn't it the gossip media</i>

452
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,700
<i>that discloses the news of Jingjing's divorce?</i>

453
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,220
Here you are.

454
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,290
What happened?

455
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,529
Jingjing just called

456
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,860
and asked us to have dinner at their home.

457
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,340
OK.

458
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,290
What's wrong?

459
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,130
Little Gu,<br>could you also be this worried?

460
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,500
It is so hard to be a domineering president.

461
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,460
Anything is easy.

462
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,010
Didn't you suggest I be confident yesterday?

463
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,009
Why do you get cold feet today?

464
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,010
I don't.

465
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,770
I just

466
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,340
don't want to let you down.

467
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,620
Why would you think that?

468
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,740
I want to be the one<br>who you can rely on.

469
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,379
I also want to spare no effort

470
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,700
to solve the issues of the company.

471
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,890
But I am afraid that I can't do it well.

472
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,460
I have been thinking about

473
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,820
what I would do if I<br>were Xu Ningyuan.

474
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,700
I can't figure it out.

475
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,250
What nonsense are you talking about?

476
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,050
How can you be so harsh?

477
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,740
I am telling you,

478
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,650
you are unique.

479
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,769
I chose to be with you because you are Gu Jiaxin.

480
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,169
No one can replace you.

481
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,010
Do you know?

482
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,620
The bigger the responsibility you take,<br>the greater the pressure is.

483
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,530
No worries.

484
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,100
I will always be with you.

485
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,860
Yueyue,

486
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,980
I'm lucky to meet you.

487
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,620
Well. Alright, alright.

488
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,289
I have something want to tell you.

489
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:13,930
Go ahead.

490
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,930
I met Song Xue on my way here.

491
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,820
She dropped a business card.

492
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,129
Isn't it the media

493
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,010
that exposes the news of Qian Jingjing's divorce?

494
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,739
If Song Xue is the backstage manipulator,

495
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,170
she is not doing it<br>only to ruin Jingjing.

496
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,130
What do you mean?

497
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,010
The exposure of the divorce

498
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,740
hurts both Jingjing and our app.

499
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,889
We must investigate her.

500
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,380
OK.

501
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,340
You focus on the plan

502
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,340
and I will pay more attention to Song Xue.

503
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,649
Are you hungry?

504
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,460
Yes.

505
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,499
- Finally!<br>- Jingjing.

506
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,249
Come in.

507
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,169
Jiaxin.

508
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,289
- Come in.<br>- Jingjing.

509
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,819
I bring two bottles of wine for you and Hao.

510
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,739
It's Guangliang Wine.

511
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,859
Simple but sincere.

512
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,499
Thank you.

513
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,169
Come on. Welcome.

514
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,929
- Come on, sit down.<br>- Sit down.

515
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,579
The dinner starts as soon as we arrive.

516
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,889
The main dish will come later.

517
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,890
You can talk while having dinner.

518
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,739
Please try the dishes made by Zhang Hao.

519
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,129
Look at Zhang Hao.

520
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,649
Gu Jiaxin always orders<br>deliveries for me only.

521
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,980
As long as you like it,

522
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,649
I will learn from Hao immediately.

523
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,250
OK.

524
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,009
You are still so sweet.

525
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,009
Young people are indeed of great enthusiasm.

526
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,410
You are also sweet.

527
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,770
Why would you invite me over for dinner today?

528
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,170
I just want to know

529
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,930
how is the company?

530
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,100
Is the news true?

531
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,220
Someone wants to buy "Love Note".

532
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,929
Jiaxin said that we must have a new version.

533
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,340
We may be able to save it.

534
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,580
I want to show you something.

535
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,859
(Daily Sweets)<br>A co-worker asked me

536
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,100
if it is your account.

537
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,620
It gives more valuable tips for living<br>than your official account does.

538
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,100
Hearing your words,<br>I'm relieved.

539
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,250
I want to discuss something with you.

540
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,580
What is it?

541
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,410
I want to make a comeback for you.

542
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,580
What do you think?

543
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,620
Do you still remember

544
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,340
when I was fat in high school?

545
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,250
I was mocked and bullied every day.

546
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,530
It is you who protected me.

547
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,170
Then I met Zhang Hao and got married to him.

548
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,500
He takes good care of me in all aspects.

549
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,650
My first response was<br>escaping when I divorced

550
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,249
and affected the app.

551
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,289
To be honest,

552
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,009
I have avoided facing it for a long time.

553
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,220
I want to be brave this time.

554
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,250
And I also want to protect you once.

555
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,770
Let me do something for you.

556
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,619
Jingjing, but...

557
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,819
Though my impact

558
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,100
is not as great as before.

559
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,459
I still want to help if you need me.

560
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,009
There is strength in numbers.

561
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,170
It's better than you two handling it alone.

562
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,220
I had a conversation with Jingjing<br>before we came here.

563
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,379
I think the real love<br>behind the fake news

564
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,890
of Jingjing and Hao

565
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,579
is very moving.

566
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,459
We can start from this point.

567
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,740
It is good for both<br>Jingjing and us.

568
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,860
Well.

569
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,010
Are you okay with that, Zhang Hao?

570
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,250
Of course.

571
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,010
I was self-righteous and<br>made many bad decisions.

572
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,459
It not only created

573
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,459
many blocks in our relationship

574
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,339
but also affected your program.

575
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,530
I will listen to Jingjing.

576
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,379
No matter what she does,

577
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,380
I will stand with her firmly.

578
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,050
Come on.

579
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,649
Difficulties are nothing.

580
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,819

581
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,819
Come on.

582
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,049
- Come on.<br>- Cheers.

583
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,820
Let's work hard!

(Six-Day Countdown)

585
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,250
I asked you to come here so late

586
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,820
for a discussion.

587
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:28,930
Now,

588
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,739
we have a chance to save "Love Note".

589
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,009
The premise is that

590
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,130
we need to offer a convincing program

591
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,580
within a week.

592
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,290
It is not easy,

593
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,890
but I still believe in you.

594
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,860
Does anyone want to join?

595
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,009
OK.

596
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,739
Let's finish the impossible task.

597
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,649
Come on.

598
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,649
- Come on.<br>- Come on.

Anna,

613
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,340
what do you think about the plan?

614
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,100
Did you make it within a week?

615
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,859
Yes.

616
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,129
The time is limited,

617
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,860
so there may be many imperfections.

618
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,290
It's OK. Anna.

619
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,100
You can tell us your thoughts.

620
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,010
I want you to explain<br>the theme of the plan first.

621
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
I will tell you a story.

622
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,290
There was a girl who was so good at work

623
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,740
but was bad in love.

624
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,500
<i>She wanted to make "Love Note" work</i>

625
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,289
<i>because she knew there were girls like her</i>

626
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,770
(Task: Not Single. Time Limit: Three Months)<br><i>in the world</i>

627
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,219
<i>who know nothing about love</i>

628
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,380
<i>and need guidance about love.</i>

629
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,129
<i>They think a tool<br>teaching them love tricks</i>

630
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,250
<i>and skills systematically</i>

631
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,130
can tell them the secret of love.

632
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,050
Then

633
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,340
she met a variable in her life.

634
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,250
<i>The impossible love<br>changed into loving her only.</i>

635
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,340
It made her realize that all the tricks and skills

636
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,700
are nothing in front of real love.

637
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,180
Sincerity

638
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,029
is the only path towards love.

639
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,910
The program

640
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,029
is her loving process.

641
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,220
You are the variable, right?

642
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,270
Yes.

643
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,909
We want to make

644
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,789
a new version of the app this time.

645
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,669
It is updated in all aspects.

646
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,629
We will change to mental guidance

647
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,340
from technical guidance.

648
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,869
We add a socializing section to it.

649
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,269
We also revise the algorithm of big data

650
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,909
to change the match-making

651
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,030
from outer conditions to mental appeal.

652
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,669
They can join the matching group

653
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,299
when they have the same preference.

654
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,299
It allows people eager for love

655
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,869
but find it difficult to meet love

656
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,390
to meet the one with the same preference and goal.

657
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,430
To be honest,

658
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,059
the program made within a week

659
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,150
can't meet my criteria.

660
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,980
Welcome.

661
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,340
OK. I will place the order for you.

662
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,580
Sir, here you are.

663
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,149
Sir, I have a secret.

664
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,429
What is it?

665
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,740
I think I may have found the spy of our company.

666
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,430
I happened to see it.

667
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,870
I also have the voice record.

668
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,339
I am about to become the hero

669
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,390
who saves the company.

670
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,099
I have fully understood it

671
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,709
after hearing what you told me last time.

672
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,779
Though my love comes to nothing,<br>I decide to

673
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,710
save Gu Jiaxin for the last time.

674
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,099
Then I will walk away,

675
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,710
which makes him remember me forever.

676
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,189
Don't laugh.

677
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,539
I mean it.

678
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,819
Fortunately, I found the spy.

679
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,579
Otherwise, the company

680
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,909
will be ruined by the two women.

681
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,780
May I listen to your evidence?

682
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,989
I planned to listen to it with Gu Jiaxin.

683
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,710
Since you are eager to do so

684
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,230
and you are one of us.

685
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,499
Okay then.

686
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,060
I will let you listen to it.

687
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,370
(Play)

688
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,150
What did she say?

689
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,470
Come to my office.

690
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,230
What did Anna say?

691
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,020
What did she say?

692
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,949
Hey.

693
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,230
Say something!

694
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,300
Did she turn us down?

695
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,579
Say something!

696
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,869
Why are you in silence?

697
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,100
What did she say?

698
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,100
She said

699
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,259
she agreed to let us make a new version.

700
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,909
Really?

701
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,669
Yes, she agreed.

702
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,669
She decided to invest in "Love Note"

703
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,580
and support the revision.

704
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,339
Great!

705
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,260
Let me show you something.

706
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,630
What's this?

707
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,780
It is the same as the previous investigation.

708
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,099
Song Xue is guilty.

709
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,469
She told Anna our<br>financial problem secretly

710
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,499
and encouraged Anna to buy our app

711
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,740
as an internal deal with her.

712
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,390
Did Anna tell you about it?

713
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,099
Though Anna wants to get our program,

714
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,229
she keeps an eye on Song Xue.

715
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,019
Song Xue betrayed the company easily,

716
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,230
so she wouldn't believe in her.

717
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,389
We reach an agreement now.

718
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,780
She told me this as a favor.

719
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,780
This is the record of their communication.

720
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,300
It is the best beginning.

721
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,300
Everything is possible

722
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,500
because of you.

723
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,740
Gu Jiaxin.

724
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,300
What is it?

725
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,870
Wait. Why didn't you knock on the door?

726
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,989
Why don't you hang<br>a Do-Not-Enter sign

727
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,300
when you kiss?

728
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,819
Yanran, do you come to Jiaxin for something?

729
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,870
I suspect Anna and Song Xue cooperate in secret.

730
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,580
There is a spy in the company and it is Song Xue.

731
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,470
Tell me.

732
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,870
I met them in a coffee shop

733
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,820
and I had a voice record.

734
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,630
Though there is no obvious evidence in it...

735
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,189
<i>Did you have painless labor?</i>

736
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,229
<i>How is it?</i>

737
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,580
<i>Yes. No one can deny it.</i>

738
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,910
<i>I felt like in heaven within a second.</i>

739
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,189
<i>What does it mean?</i>

740
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,260
<i>I felt less pain</i>

741
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,470
<i>after the injection.</i>

742
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,389
Though I did not record any valid evidence,

743
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,669
I do suspect them.

744
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,260
There are signs.

745
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,149
As soon as the crisis happened,

746
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,579
Song Xue went back to the company

747
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,469
and took Jiangyue's position immediately.

748
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,869
As soon as the crisis happened,

749
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,259
Song Xue went back to the company

750
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,629
and took Ms. Zhao's position immediately.

751
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,669
It's hard not to suspect that

752
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,539
It's hard not to suspect that

753
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,780
she did that in secret.

754
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,670
What's more,<br>why did Anna appear...

755
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,779
Exactly when Jin<br>Yan was in hospital?

756
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,019
What a coincidence.

757
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,949
If Song Xue catches the<br>chance and makes the deal,

758
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,539
she is very likely to...

759
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,869
She is very likely to take over.

760
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,059
As she pleased...

761
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,189
She can control "Love Note" as she pleased.

762
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,539
In a word,<br>Sons Xue is quite suspicious.

763
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,990
I suggest you have a thorough investigation.

764
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,780
Yanran,

765
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,990
great speech.

766
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,910
We have got the evidence.

767
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,870
You have gotten the evidence?

768
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,390
Anna gave it to me

769
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,539
and Jiangyue found

770
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,260
that Song Xue is to be blamed<br>for Qian Jingjing's divorce.

771
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,059
What a black sheep!

772
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,259
Why did she do that?

773
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,500
Ms. Jin is good to her.

774
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,229
<i>Excuse me, I have to go to the restroom.</i>

775
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,870
<i>OK.</i>

776
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,340
<i>Hello.</i>

777
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,990
<i>Why didn't you send the baby to the hospital<br>when he was sick?</i>

778
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,910
He is suffering from a severe cough.

779
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,300
You're busy.

780
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,100
Are you the only one who is busy?

781
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,540
Can't you think more about me?

782
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,339
If you aren't in heavy debt

783
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,230
and become a defaulter,<br>do I have to work?

784
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,230
<i>OK. I get it.</i>

785
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,190
<i>What did I do to deserve this?</i>

786
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,740
A couple of days ago,

787
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,779
I heard from my business partners

788
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,739
that the company of Song Xue's husband

789
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,910
was about to bankrupt.

790
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,780
She had no choice

791
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,670
but came back to the company.

792
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,909
It was her who spared no effort to

793
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,189
marry into the purple.

794
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,500
She made it with her baby.

795
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,299
She is now betraying the company

796
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,630
to obtain personal profit.

797
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,710
I despise her.

798
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,990
In any case,

799
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,190
thank you for your help.

800
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,630
I help you just because...

801
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,949
I will always help when seeing injustice.

802
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,820
I am also a part of the company.

803
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,150
(Murphy's Law of Love)

804
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,020
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

805
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,429
No.

806
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,390
Are you talking about the psychological effect?

807
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,189
If there is a chance to go wrong in something,

808
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,019
it will always happen

809
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,389
no matter how little the chance is.

810
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,539
Yes, it is.

811
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,060
The app said that Murphy's Law also works in love.

812
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,230
What does it mean?

813
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,339
When someone wants to cheat,

814
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,930
temptation always appears.

815
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,539
It gets harder to maintain a relationship

816
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,579
when it missed something at the beginning.

817
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,249
Oh my god. It is so correct.

818
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,209
Right?

819
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,299
And this.

820
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,409
A person who is hard to get

821
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,619
will not be with you for a long time

822
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,650
even if you make it.

823
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,250
Really?

824
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,689
Do I need to give up<br>on my Prince Charming?

825
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,019
Don't you change it every day?

826
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,059
No.

827
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,409
Look at this. It is right.

828
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,489
Murphy's Law tells us<br>humans are getting smarter.

829
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,489
But it is never possible for a human

830
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,539
to know about everything in this universe.

831
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,339
Making mistakes easily is<br>a weakness born with us.

832
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,299
In a relationship,

833
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,379
there are things that we can't avoid.

834
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,822
What we can do is to stay true to the original self

835
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:41,982
and cut loss in time.

836
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:43,782
Well said!
