[Episode 18]

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,970
[2012]

5
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,150
Hello?

6
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,270
Hello.

7
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,390
I'm Lin Han.

8
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,670
Do you still remember me?

9
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,030
Lin Han?

10
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,150
I think we met

11
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,980
at CS, right?

12
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,550
So, you still remember me?

13
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,910
Are you willing to be my girlfriend?

14
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,310
[I know]

15
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,390
[many people are trying to court you.]

16
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
[But they aren't sincere to you.]

17
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,230
[I'm the only sincere one.]

18
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,590
[If you become my girlfriend,]

19
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,710
[I will surely treat you well.]

20
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,630
We don't suit each other.

21
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,030
I'm sleepy.

22
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,030
I'll sleep first.

23
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,270
[I truly like you.]

24
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,270
[Trust me.]

25
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,260
[Be my girlfriend.]

26
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,390
[Will this number]

27
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,790
[really answer all of my questions?]

28
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,110
[Can it tell me]

29
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,870
[how to court my female goddess?]

30
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,710
[Xiao Xiao.]

31
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,420
[Please tell me]

32
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,070
[if I can be together with Xiao Xiao.]

33
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,950
[You two are a match made in heaven.]

34
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,550
[Of course you two would be together.]

35
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,630
He's just a typical suitor.

36
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,030
What's with that attitude?

37
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,950
This is

38
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,950
a serious matter.

39
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,790
It's all because Yi Xiao

40
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,630
had too many suitors

41
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,110
when we were in high school.

42
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,190
Yi Xiao didn't fancy any of them.

43
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,630
Let's forget about the past.

44
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,070
I just think that he's a bit scary.

45
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,670
He even knew my home address.

46
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,470
Yi Xiao,

47
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,670
I think

48
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,270
you should stay cautious.

49
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,390
Find us

50
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,190
if anything happens.

51
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,909
Okay.

52
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,909
I understand.

53
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,670
By the way,

54
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,950
I'm performing tomorrow night.

55
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,270
Remember to watch my performance.

56
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,710
What will you be performing?

57
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,150
Romeo and Juliet.

58
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,470
I will surely be there.

59
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,230
I...

60
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,830
I have something to do
in Home Cuisine tomorrow.

61
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,310
I

62
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,430
will try my best to be there,

63
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,350
Little Juliet.

64
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,310
Class dismissed.

65
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,870
Why isn't Zhu Yi Xiao here today?

66
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,390
She didn't answer my calls either.

67
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,510
Do you know where she went?

68
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,150
How should I know when you don't?

69
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,190
Now that I think about it,

70
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,550
I think that suitor of hers

71
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,310
was too passionate.

72
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,830
I'm a bit worried about her.

73
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,750
Call her then.

74
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,990
If she doesn't pick up,
we'll head to her house tonight.

75
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,590
Aren't they performing Romeo and Juliet

76
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,710
at the theatre tonight?

77
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,110
You're right.

78
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,190
Let's find her in the theatre then.

79
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,550
Will Fan Fan

80
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,470
head there too?

81
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,750
I think so.

82
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,870
Fan Fan loves yoghurt.

83
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,790
Aren't you exaggerating it?

84
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,110
Can she finish all of them?

85
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,990
It's fine as long as she likes them.

86
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,590
So, Fan Fan loves yoghurt.

87
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,870
That's right.

88
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,190
So, what's the relationship
between the two of you right now?

89
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,470
Anyway, I know she fancies me.

90
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,590
It felt pretty good.

91
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,750
I didn't know

92
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,190
what flavour you like.

93
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,630
That's why I bought every flavour

94
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,790
of every brand.

95
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:16,910
This...

96
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,590
Isn't this too much?

97
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,670
Where's Qin Yang?

98
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,110
Qin Yang?

99
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,950
He went to find Zhu Yi Xiao
at the backstage.

100
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,220
He said he was worried about her

101
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,030
since he didn't see her the entire day.

102
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:27,950
What's wrong?

103
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,990
Nothing.

104
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,990
Let's wait for Yi Xiao's performance.

105
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,030
When people are
at the brink of their deaths,

106
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,070
they would instead

107
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,030
feel relieved.

108
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,150
The people who observed them

109
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,550
said this was a sign of

110
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,870
terminal lucidity.

111
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,150
Is this what I'm experiencing right now?

112
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,990
My love.

113
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,430
My wife.

114
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,630
Although death

115
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,510
has sucked away the nectar in your breath,

116
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,990
no power

117
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,590
can take away your beautiful appearance!

118
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,470
You haven't been conquered yet!

119
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,790
[Yi Xiao is on the stage.]

120
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,950
[Come back.]

121
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,470
Your face,

122
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,150
your lips,

123
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,190
they still radiate an immense beauty.

124
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,380
Is this the scene
they're performing today?

125
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,190
They didn't perform this scene
during the rehearsal.

126
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,590
Why are they performing
the martyrdom scene?

127
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,830
After this, Romeo will commit suicide
by drinking the poison.

128
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,990
Juliet's part is over.

129
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,790
I wanted to see
Zhu Yi Xiao's acting, you know?

130
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,350
I don't think we'll get to see that.

131
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,270
If so,

132
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,230
why don't we leave?

133
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,030
Let's go.

134
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,310
Let's go.

135
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,830
Let's go.

136
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,550
Tybalt,

137
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,510
are you going to lay down there

138
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,950
with that bloody shroud of yours?

139
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,710
Your youth

140
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,470
was already taken away by your killer.

141
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,710
Now, I will avenge you!

142
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,830
I will kill those who had
caused your demise!

143
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,830
Forgive me,

144
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,190
my brother.

145
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,910
My dear Juliet,

146
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,990
why are you as beautiful as always?

147
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,790
Could it be that the hollow death,

148
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,390
that wrinkled and loathsome devil,

149
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,990
was a passionate lover too?

150
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,550
Is that why

151
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,990
he has kept you hidden in this dark hole

152
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,390
so that you can be his mistress?

153
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,700
No!

154
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,910
He cannot do this.

155
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,310
I will stay by your side forever.

156
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,710
I will stay here

157
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,110
for my beloved.

158
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,470
Xiao Xiao!

159
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,710
It's Lin Han!

160
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,910
No one can stop us from being together!

161
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,230
Look closely!

162
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:16,990
Let go of me!

163
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,870
That's Zhu Yi Xiao!

164
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,870
She's not your Juliet!

165
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,030
Xiao Xiao is my beloved!

166
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,190
Even he said we were
a match made in heaven!

167
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,950
Who is he?

168
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,230
Let go of me!

169
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,630
Fan Fan,

170
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,270
look after Yi Xiao.

171
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,470
Xiao Xiao.

172
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,710
Xiao Xiao?

173
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,830
Wake up.

174
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,350
Yi Xiao!

175
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,110
Yi Xiao, wake up!

176
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,460
[Emergency Centre]

177
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,070
She's fine.

178
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,870
She'll be fine after the effect
of the sleeping pills has subsided.

179
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,590
Rest well.

180
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,510
Thank you, doctor.

181
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,150
Thank you, everyone.

182
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,990
Who knew what would happen to me
if you guys didn't interfere?

183
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,830
Mainly, it's thanks to Qin Yang.

184
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,150
Anyway,

185
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,510
all's well that ends well.

186
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,030
That's right.

187
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,150
Yi Xiao,

188
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,390
do you still remember

189
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,510
what happened?

190
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,470
I remember I got home.

191
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,190
After that, I fell unconscious.

192
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,070
This Lin Han is too much.

193
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,590
He was pretty normal when we first met him

194
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,790
at CS.

195
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,950
I didn't expect him to be this radical.

196
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,790
The cops said that Lin Han bore a grudge
against you for rejecting him.

197
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,910
He called the Wish Number

198
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,550
and followed its instruction.
That's how he became radical.

199
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,990
It's all my fault.

200
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,590
I shouldn't have given him my number.

201
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,310
Is this number

202
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,670
related to Gao Ru Wen?

203
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,310
The previous owner of this shop

204
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,030
was extremely lucky.

205
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,350
He bought the lottery

206
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,390
and he won the first prize.

207
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,710
After that, he sold the shop to me.

208
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,710
He has returned
to his hometown and retired.

209
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,110
He's that lucky?

210
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,310
I have never struck the lottery before.

211
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,950
I heard that he had help

212
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,270
from an expert.

213
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,190
What expert?

214
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,710
I remembered he played a silly game.

215
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,870
That's right.

216
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,270
I think that's it.

217
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,750
If you play the game,
you'll get a phone number.

218
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,030
The owner of the comic book shop
I used to frequent struck the lottery

219
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,870
after he called this number.

220
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,700
Yi Xiao,

221
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,990
sorry that you had to come here with us

222
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,750
right after you were discharged.

223
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,310
It's fine.

224
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,430
This is what I bought from
the previous game winner.

225
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,230
I think this is the one.

226
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,910
Capitalism is the root of all evil.

227
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,430
Have you guys come up
with a plan to lure him out?

228
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,590
Why don't we

229
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,990
call him directly?

230
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,510
No.

231
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,190
If Gao Ru Wen knew that it was us,

232
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,350
he would never appear.

233
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,190
So,

234
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,470
we should pretend to be Lin Han's friend

235
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,390
and send him a text message

236
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,030
so that we can lure him out.

237
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,870
I'll do it.

238
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,310
Hello.

239
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm a friend of Lin Han.

240
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,150
I know

241
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,990
you can help me fulfil my wish,

242
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,030
but I wish

243
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,750
to see you.

244
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,910
Is that okay?

245
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,950
Done.

246
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,530
[You received a text message]

247
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,830
He said yes!

248
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,470
It's that easy?

249
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,990
Something seems amiss.

250
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,030
3 pm tomorrow,

251
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,150
Anning Avenue,

252
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,750
Timez Cafe.

253
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,270
That won't do.

254
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,270
This is too risky.

255
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,300
You mustn't go.

256
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,670
This is a rare opportunity.

257
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,590
I must go.

258
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,430
No.

259
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,070
How about this?

260
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,350
For safety's sake, I think the four of us

261
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,630
should go together.

262
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,350
At least

263
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,110
we can look out for each other.

264
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,190
Agreed.

265
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,150
How about this?

266
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,670
Since we just contacted him

267
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,910
through text messaging,

268
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,990
he doesn't know the gender of the sender.

269
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,790
Qin Yang and I will meet them.

270
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,350
You two

271
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,350
can wait for your chance to act.

272
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,630
It's decided then.

273
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:11,870
Fan Fan,

274
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,870
does Gao Ru Wen

275
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,030
know who I am?

276
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,830
I cannot be sure

277
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,710
whether the current Gao Ru Wen knows you.

278
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,350
And,

279
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,620
we couldn't confirm whether he was home

280
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,430
when we visited Dr. Shen's house.

281
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:33,630
I got an idea.

282
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,270
Why are you guys so shy?

283
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,430
You two look gorgeous.

284
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,590
It's a waste that you two

285
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,950
aren't models.

286
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,540
Was this the idea you got?

287
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,180
That's right.

288
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,070
Even we couldn't recognise you two.

289
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:28,830
I'm sure Gao Ru Wen

290
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,670
cannot recognise you two.

291
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,230
That's right!

292
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,870
Seems like we have to sacrifice ourselves

293
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,790
to achieve our goals.

294
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,190
You're right.

295
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,990
Raise your head.

296
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,110
Straighten your back.

297
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,310
Keep your stomach in.

298
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,030
Be confident.

299
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,830
Little Qin Yang here

300
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,430
does look pretty charming.

301
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,790
Why don't you

302
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,950
be our personal servant?

303
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,110
Yes, my lady.

304
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,350
Why did you join them?

305
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,030
It was just a joke.

306
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,350
But Ruo Chen, you do look

307
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,950
as pretty as a flower in a girl's attire.

308
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,790
More like Ru Hua.

309
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,349
Why are you being so honest?

310
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,630
You said I looked like Ru Hua?

311
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,630
Ru...

312
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,630
Ru Hua, huh?

313
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,310
Hold it right there!

314
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,990
No!

315
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,550
Qin Yang,

316
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,550
help!

317
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,590
Someone sent us a text message.

318
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,910
The person wants to meet us tomorrow.

319
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,230
It's my first time encountering a person
who wants to see me personally.

320
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,670
If so,

321
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,750
will you go?

322
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,110
Of course.

323
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,430
I need to see who it is.

324
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,350
We can bring the person downstairs

325
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,630
out to get some sun as well.

326
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,510
I'll tag along.

327
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,390
People will suspect us
if we stay together.

328
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,550
Be a good boy.

329
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,590
Stay at home and wait for our return.

330
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,120
[No More Than Skins]

331
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,390
I think he won't recognise us

332
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,350
in this get-up, right?

333
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,710
Be more confident.

334
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,270
Even I couldn't recognise you two,

335
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,590
not to mention Gao Ru Wen.

336
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,470
You got a point.

337
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,070
Don't act rashly when you see Gao Ru Wen.

338
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,500
Got it.

339
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,670
Ten minutes have passed.

340
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,270
Why isn't he here yet?

341
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,790
Is he still coming or not?

342
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,150
Calm down.

343
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,630
Maybe he's already here.

344
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,540
Maybe he's observing the situation.

345
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,030
Let's wait for a little longer.

346
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,390
Did you see anyone suspicious?

347
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,870
None for now.

348
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,150
Shen Shi Jia?

349
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,270
Calm down.

350
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,180
Let me try to understand
the situation for now.

351
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,150
Dr. Shen,

352
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,190
why are you here?

353
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,270
You two were the ones who asked me out.

354
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,230
You mean us?

355
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,630
Did we ask you out?

356
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,190
Who is

357
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,870
that person?

358
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,910
He's Gao Ru Wen's foster father.

359
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,230
If that's so, we can just ask him

360
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,670
about Gao Ru Wen's whereabouts, right?

361
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,870
Dr. Shen,

362
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,830
where have you been
for the past few months?

363
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,270
What wish do you have?

364
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,230
Ruo Chen,

365
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,750
something feels off

366
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,070
about him.

367
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,550
Dr. Shen,

368
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,750
I'm Liu Ruo Chen.

369
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,750
Do you know who I am?

370
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,270
What wish do you have?

371
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,190
Ruo Chen,

372
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,790
he's not acting like his usual self.

373
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,470
So, it's them.

374
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,710
Are you the owner of the Wish Number?

375
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,270
I will leave if you don't have any wishes.

376
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,510
Dr. Shen,

377
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,870
where have you been
for the past few months?

378
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,510
Is Gao Ru Wen together with you?

379
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,550
That's right.

380
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,470
Where is Gao Ru Wen?

381
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,310
I wish to see him.

382
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,430
Master is right here.

383
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,230
Master?

384
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,590
I'm looking for Gao Ru Wen.

385
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,630
I think he meant

386
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,910
that Gao Ru Wen is his master.

387
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,190
He might be close by.

388
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,070
Gao Ru Wen is over there!

389
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,470
Mister.

390
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,030
Mister, they'll return soon!

391
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:28,950
Mister!

392
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,390
Mister, please stay here!

393
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,630
There's no one here.

394
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,110
Gao Ru Wen is the owner
of the Wish Number indeed.

395
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,430
Let's ask Shen Shi Jia again.

396
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,790
Yi Xiao!

397
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,030
Get up!

398
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,550
Are you okay?

399
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,470
I'm fine.

400
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,390
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,590
I couldn't stop him.

402
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,870
It's not your fault.

403
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,710
We've underestimated him.

404
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,590
It seemed like Shen Shi Jia
was hypnotised.

405
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,550
I didn't expect Gao Ru Wen
to do this to his own father.

406
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,270
He'll harm plenty of people in the future.

407
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,230
Why don't we call the cops?

408
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,910
These are just our statements.

409
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,630
We need to acquire real evidence.

410
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,990
You guys are done changing already?

411
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,230
I actually hoped that I could enjoy
the cross-dressing a little longer.

412
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,430
Yeah.

413
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,030
I think you two looked great

414
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,110
in female attire.

415
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,980
Since Fan Fan likes it,

416
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,590
we'll wear them again next time.

417
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,910
You said so yourself.

418
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,910
I didn't say anything.

419
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,660
But I think

420
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,590
our effort was in vain today.

421
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,990
I don't think so.

422
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,590
At least our deduction was right.

423
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,350
Why don't we

424
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,310
force him to show himself again?

425
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,870
I think Gao Ru Wen is on high alert now.

426
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,350
I'm afraid it wouldn't be that easy

427
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,110
for us to lure him out again.

428
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,870
Why don't we

429
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,390
head back for today?

430
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,390
Let's go.

431
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,720
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

432
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,790
[I'm Qin Yang.]

433
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,870
[I loved Physics since young.]

434
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,470
[I'm willing to explore the unknown.]

435
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,390
[I indulge myself
in the unknown universe.]

436
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,270
[The comfortable sun,]

437
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,150
[the gentle breeze,]

438
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,030
[they touch our hearts,]

439
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,650
♫ The wind is travelling,
the mind is flying ♫

440
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,430
[but never linger.]

441
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,830
♫ The stars connect into a path ♫

442
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,390
[I don't have any friends.]

443
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,930
♫ Sometimes clear, sometimes unclear ♫

444
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,230
[My only friend]

445
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,670
[is Liu Ruo Chen.]

446
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,030
♫ Yet it guides you closer ♫

447
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,270
[He's my buddy and my friend.]

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,260
♫ Time is quiet, memories are screaming ♫

449
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,030
[He supports my dream.]

450
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,350
♫ Awakened by you anytime ♫

451
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,350
[Since I was young,]

452
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,660
♫ As the light is as beautiful as poems ♫

453
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,870
[he has always been giving in to me.]

454
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,340
♫ I have to stop while I'm on my way ♫

455
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,510
[He has always been tolerating me.]

456
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,620
♫ I love to take
one, two, three, four steps ♫

457
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,150
[I hope Ruo Chen]

458
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,190
[can stay happy forever.]

459
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,480
♫ After the moonlight, and read ♫

460
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,740
♫ The lines related to you with my gaze ♫

461
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,190
♫ I love to study every word ♫

462
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,410
♫ Of the dream, like how the rose ♫

463
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,820
♫ Lets go of its petal for the teen ♫

464
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,010
♫ I love it when little by little,
day by day ♫

465
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,110
♫ I collect answers, so that you ♫

466
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,260
♫ Get your answer before even asking ♫

467
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,740
♫ I love to take a step ♫

468
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,930
♫ And venture far time after time,
like a knight ♫

469
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,940
♫ That protects you with his arms opened ♫
