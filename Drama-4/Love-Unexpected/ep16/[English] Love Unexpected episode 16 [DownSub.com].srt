00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,070
[Sister Lu hasn't come yet today.]

[However,]

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,229
[she found out
that I was messaging you yesterday]

10

[do you want to buy me
a mobile phone first as backup?]

use my old phone anymore.]

You're sending messages

I just want you to be Brother Ruo Chen.

17
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,510
You're still young,
but you already know how to ship couples.

18

19
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,390
What does shipping couples mean?

20
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,030
Let me delete Liu Ruo Chen's phone number

21

messages to him anymore.

33
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,590
Good morning.

34
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,110
Why are you here?

35
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,910
I'm here to send you flowers.

36
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,829
Where are the flowers?

37
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,990
What are you planting?

38
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,950
You will know after it blooms.

39
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,950
But I already have
enough flowers in my yard.

40
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,150
But this is different.

41
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,700
This is the flower that
symbolises our friendship.

42
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,710
So, it's different.

43
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,430
You really don't have to do this.

44
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,470
As long as the matter of
Gao Ru Wen is not resolved,

45
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,950
I can't feel at ease.

46
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,070
I understand.

47
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,630
But it doesn't stop us
from being friends, right?

48
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,590
[We don't even know
where Gao Ru Wen is now.]

[it's impossible for us
to make friends with him.]

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,670
[But I can't let him
do anything to hurt people.]

52
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,470
[What should I do?]

53
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,550
[She's missing someone again.]

54

[Let me call Brother Ruo Chen.]

55

Hello.

56
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,150
Hello, Brother Ruo Chen.

57
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,310
Sister Lu is in a bad state today.

58
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,740
I think

59
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,030
she still has you in mind.

60
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,870
[You should take the initiative
to care about her.]

61
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,150
I will only displease her if I
take the initiative to find her now.

62
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,270
In fact, I do not know what I do poorly.

63
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,550
She said the better I treat her,
the more burdened she is.

64
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,830
This is so strange.

65
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,190
It is true that girls are
difficult to understand.

66
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,750
You're a girl too.

67
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,030
I still young,

68
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,270
it's different.

69
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,670
Then, what should you do?

70
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,310
I don't know too.

71
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,430
Just give her some time.

72
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,310
[You can't give her a chance.]

73
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,950
We need to use some tactics

74
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,590
while she still likes you.

75
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,110
You said she likes me?

76
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,750
Why are you so surprised?

77
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,190
You should have confidence in yourself.

78
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,510
[How about this?]

79
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,710
[I will arrange an offline event for you.]

80
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,070
[You two can meet again.]

81
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,510
[Maybe she will be soft-hearted,]

82
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,190
[or make her feel a sense of crisis.]

83
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,670
It sounds like it makes sense.

84
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,590
Then,

85
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,270
what exactly is the offline event?

86
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,430
I'll keep it a secret for now.

87
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,030
Anyway, call all your friends to join us.

88
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,510
The more people we have, the merrier.

89
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,870
Alright.

90
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,909
[She still has to work tomorrow.]

91
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,790
[What should I do?]

92
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,990
Hello, Qin Yang.

93
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,310
[Hello, Ruo Chen. What's the matter?]

94
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,870
What are your plans for tomorrow?

95
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,190

the Hall effect experiment tomorrow.

96

[Don't stay at home everyday.]

97
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,230
[Hang out with me.]

98
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,300
Wait a moment.

99
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,710
Take

100
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,670
Yi…

101
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,550
Take Yi Xiao with you.

102
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,550
Why should I take her with me?

103
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,390
[A sense of crisis.]

104
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,390
[I can create it if there is none.]

105
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,990
Can somebody tell me

106
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,990
what is love all about?

107
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,390
Don't touch me.

108
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,030
Do you have to be like this?

109
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,470
I just asked you to
clean up the kitchen today.

110
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,870
You've been depressed all day.

111
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,030
What are you not satisfied with?

112
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,950
Say it.

113
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,670
Are you going to say it?

114
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,750
Are you going to say it?

115
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,510
If you don't want to say it,

116
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,270
I will leave then.

117
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,710
Faded.

118
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,430
Your love for me

119
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,350
has faded.

120
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,230
I worked so hard to clean up

121
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,430
the kitchen today.

122
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,060
But…

123
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,710
But I'm not even rewarded.

124
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,830
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

125
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,310
And you're asking for a reward?

126
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,110
Why?

127
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,870
Do I no longer deserve to be rewarded?

128
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,070
Madam Li Ya Xi,

129
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,750
I'm not even worthy of

130
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,150
encouragement in your mind now?

131
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,270
Gosh.

132
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,630
Mr. Lu Fen Jin,

133
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,790
what do you want as a reward?

134
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,430
At least it must be that kind of

135
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,630
suffocating

136
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,870
embrace.

137
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,150
Otherwise, I will surely

138
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,270
have insomnia tonight.

139
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,150
Okay.

140
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,910
Let me give you a hug.

141
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,550
Can you two stop

142
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,710
being flirty in front of me?

143
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,670
I'm still a kid.

144
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,430
Why are you here?

145
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,710
Have you finished your homework?

146
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,270
I have.

147
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,230
If you have finished it,

148
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,230
why don't you do some reading?

149
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,910
I want to discuss something with you.

150
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,710
What is it?

151
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,070
Say it.

152
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,590
Can you give me a break for tomorrow?

153
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,390
A break?

154
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,230
Why should I give you a break for a day?

155
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,430
Because I have a

156
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,670
very important thing to do.

157
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,470
Lu Fan Fan,

158
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,510
what could be more important

159
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,990
than your studies now?

160
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,590
It's about Sister Lu.

161
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,630
Sister,

162
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,430
If you're in a bad mood,

163
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,510
you don't have to sweep the floor anymore.

164
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,390
Let me help you.

165
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,350
You're almost done sweeping anyway.

166
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,910
I'm not in a bad mood.

167
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:12,870
Lu,

168
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,150
haven't you and Liu reconciled yet?

169
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,750
Do you feel better when you keep yourself

170
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,110
so busy every day?

171
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,950
That's true.

172
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,630
I'm not in a bad mood.

173
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,070
I can take care of my own business.

174
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,150
You

175
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,060
don't have to worry about me.

176
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,030
Silly girl.

177
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,390
We can tell by your looks.

178
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,030
You've been

179
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,830
forcing a smile these days.

180
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,030
There's a good saying.

181
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,150
When there's someone for you to rely on,

182
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,070
you're still a kid

183
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,710
no matter how old you are.

184
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,950
When there's no one for you to rely on,

185
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,430
you're an adult

186
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,340
no matter how young you are.

187
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,310
Here

188
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,710
is your home.

189
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,270
You are always a kid in this home.

190
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,750
At first,

191
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,750
I was

192
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,790
really not

193
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,830
feeling sad.

194
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,470
But now you say so,

195
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,550
I feel that

196
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,110
I am still quite aggrieved.

197
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,830
Silly girl.

198
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,270
Cry out if you want to.

199
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,190
Can somebody tell me

200
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,270
what is love all about?

201
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,070
What time is it now?

202
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,510
You're still expressing
your feelings here?

203
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,070
I just lamented a little.

204
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,150
Right,

205
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,190
the weather

206
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,430
is very good these days.

207
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,750
I'll let you off tomorrow.

208
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,390
You can hang out

209
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,590
with Fan Fan.

210
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,670
Yeah.

211
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,190
You will still get paid.

212
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,590
This is such a great offer.

213
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,390
Say yes now.

214
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,790
Thank you, aunt.

215
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,310
A real Counter-Strike game?

216
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,910
This is what you said about
taking me for a break?

217
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,230
Yes.

218
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,790
What is more relieving

219
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,950
than beating people
when you fall out of love?

220
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,510
It makes sense.

221
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,590
Besides,

222
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,310
I heard that this 
Counter-Strike store is different.

223
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,670
If you win,

224
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,150
you can get a 
mysterious number of the city.

225
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,070
Just call this number

226
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,550
and you'll get

227
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,220
all the answers you want.

228
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,790
I heard that Uncle Xiang

229
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,910
got the mysterious number of the city

230
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,750
after winning the game

231
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,830
and later won the lottery.

232
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,910
It's already 2012.

233
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,830
you still believe in this?

234
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,710
Just have a try.

235
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,580
Don't you have any questions
you want to ask?

236
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,310
[If I really had a question to ask,]

237
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,870
[it would be about
my future with Liu Ruo Chen.]

238
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,150
Hi.

239
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,110
We want to register.

240
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,190
Two people?

241
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,190
It's enough to have both of us.

242
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,310
We can shoot all the enemies.

243
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,870
If you have only two people,

244
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,590
the number of participants is not enough.

245
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,550
How about this?

246
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,310
Or

247
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,110
I'll see if there are other participants

248
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,190
and help you team up later.

249
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:14,950
Alright.

250
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,430
Thank you.

251
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,150
Okay.

252
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,910
[They are coming.]

253
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,390
It's Brother Ruo Chen!

254
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,990
Lu!

255
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,550
What happened?

256
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,790
I sprained my ankle.

257
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,350
Here.

258
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,830
Here.

259
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,430
Sit down.

260
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,110
You are here to play 
the real Counter-Strike game,

261
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,710
how can you wear high heels?

262
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,510
Look.

263
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,940
Luckily, I brought flat shoes.

264
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,030
[How could Liu Ruo Chen]

265
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,510
[get together with Yi Xiao so quickly?]

266
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,430
[Bad guy.]

267
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,190
Fan Fan,

268
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,270
you're here too?

269
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,670
Do you want to be on our team?

270
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,670
Sure.

271
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,110
It's fine.

272
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,110
Thank you.

273
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,790
What was she

274
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,790
gesturing there?

275
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,470
She asked us

276
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,270
to follow her.

277
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,110
She will help us.

278
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,070
Did you tip them off?

279
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,750
It's not me.

280
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,830
Let's go team up.

281
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,380
Let's go.

282
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,710
[Lucky box]

283
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,910
Dear participants,

284
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,790
since there are only five of you now,

285
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,550
so

286
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,390
I'm joining you

287
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,230
for a three-to-three battle.

288
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,430
I don't want to play.

289
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,390
Since you're already here,
let's play one round.

290
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,550
Just one round.

291
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,030
So, have you decided?

292
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,030
Yes,

293
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,670
we will join.

294
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,110
How about you?

295
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,670
Little girl,

296
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,950
you draw first.

297
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,510
[This girl]

298
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,630
[is so beautiful.]

299
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,230
I'm in the blue team.

300
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,150
You are in the red team.

301
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,570
[Red team]

302
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,190
Brother Ruo Chen is in the red team too.

303
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,430
[Red team]

304
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,140
I'm in the red team too.

305
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,110
Ruo Chen,

306
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,350
have you forgotten
that my ankle still hurts?

307
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,950
You have to protect me later.

308
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,070
Protect Fan Fan too

309
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,710
because we are girls.

310
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,590
Don't count me in.

311
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,750
I'm not that weak.

312
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,910
I will protect you two.

313
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm leaving first.

314
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,070
Walk behind me.

315
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,820
My shooting skills are good.

316
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,990
I can play as a forward.

317
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,190
Why do I have to walk behind you?

318
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:00,830
Yes.

319
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,270
Fan Fan's shooting skills are so good.

320
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,590
Let her go to the front

321
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,950
and we can walk behind her slowly.

322
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,430
Strategically,

323
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,950
those with poor shooting skills
should be in front.

324
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,390
You cover me

325
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,390
and I will shoot.

326
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,750
Just now, you said you would protect me.

327
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,750
Now, you want me to be shot.

328
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,790
Forget it.

329
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,070
My ankle is still in pain.

330
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,750
I won't be your burden.

331
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,990
I'm going to watch at the side.

332
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:21,990
Yi Xiao.

333
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,950
Now, it's just the two of us.

334
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,550
How are we going to fight

335
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:29,990
Trust me.

336
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,110
Even if it's just the two of us,
we can still win.

337
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,100
Let's go.

338
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,950
This is so tiring.

339
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,190
I even have to play
Counter-Strike game with them.

340
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,030
Fan Fan.

341
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,070
Two o'clock.

342
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,630
Cover me.

343
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,750
Ruo Chen,

344
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,860
you sneaked up on me!

345
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,110
Brother Ruo Chen,

346
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,350
you shot me!

347
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,550
That's my instinctive response.

348
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,150
Fan Fan!

349
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,190
Ruo Chen.

350
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,550
Shoot!

351
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,110
Liu Ruo Chen,

352
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,430
what are you doing?

353
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,310
That's my instinctive response.

354
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,420
That was a very precise shot.

355
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,870
It was just okay.

356
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,190
I'll help you up first

357
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,390
You…

358
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,950
Didn't you say

359
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,510
you wanted to keep a distance from me?

360
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,310
Can you let me go?

361
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,310
We won!

362
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,540
Won already?

363
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,420
This Counter-Strike game

364
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,900
is not as difficult as
I thought it would be.

365
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,550
I think

366
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,430
this gift is the
shared reward of our team.

367
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,670
The three of us should share it together.

368
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,230
I play the game just to relax.

369
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,190
Don't count me in.

370
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,110
I'll

371
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,350
settle the score with you later.

372
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,990
I'm leaving.

373
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,030
Sister!

374
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,310
Take this.

375
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
I don't want.

376
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,190
Take this.

377
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,630
Thank you.

378
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,950
I'll go clean up first.

379
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,470
-Bye.
-Bye.

380
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,430
Do you guys think

381
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,510
she noticed something?

382
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,790
I think

383
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,350
we overacted a little bit.

384
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,350
What?

385
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,190
You asked me to be affectionate with you

386
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,510
to see if Fan Fan will be jealous?

387
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,500
No, I can't.

388
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,470
Please help me.

389
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,150
Consider it a favour for your friend.

390
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,750
Fan Fan is my friend too.

391
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,070
I don't want to care about you.

392
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,790
I really can't think of any other way.

393
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,710
Please be kind.

394
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,790
This can be considered a white lie, right?

395
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,230
You'd better not do it, Ruo Chen.

396
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,750
I am also afraid that
Fan Fan will get angry.

397
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,110
Alright.

398
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,670
You guys just watch me grow old alone.

399
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,660
Okay.

400
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,190
I will help you.

401
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,750
I will help you just once.

402
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,870
Just once.

403
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,070
Could she have made up her mind
to leave me?

404
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,670
Don't worry.

405
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,670
I'm here.

406
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,470
You?

407
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,830
You're going to pretend that you like me

408
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,230
to make Fan Fan jealous?

409
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,110
I don't want to, even if you do.

410
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,230
I mean,

411
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,190
we are here.

412
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,670
We are on your side.

413
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,790
Cheer up.

414
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:30,950
Cheer up.

415
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,830
Cheer up.

416
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,190
Liu Ruo Chen and others

417
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,670
have gotten the number
at the Counter-Strike store.

418
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,510
But they gave it to others.

419
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,470
Got it.

420
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,950
Just say what's on your mind.

421
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,110
I would like to know

422
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,870
the function of that number.

423
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,390
Why do they all wish to get that number?

424
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,630
It's not everyone is willing

425
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,190
to achieve something through hard work.

426
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,350
I am only

427
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,030
taking advantage of their weaknesses.

428
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,510
Starting from today,

429
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,230
keep an eye on their movements,

430
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,830
especially Lu Fan Fan.

431
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,990
You have to report to me

432
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,390
every move she makes.

433
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,790
Why her?

434
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,380
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

435
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,270
Our coffee is here.

436
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:12,900
♫ Gently put a star in your hand ♫

437
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,030
♫ Carefully measure our distance ♫

438
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:28,850
♫ If you use an expression
that I can never forget in my life ♫

439
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,150
Don't think too much.

440
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,230
I just want you to be happy.

441
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:36,290
♫ And walk into that downpour
in the centre of the world ♫

442
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,270
♫ I will wait behind you with
an umbrella for the rain to stop ♫

443
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,060
♫ When the sky clears, I'll give you ♫

444
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,810
♫ This box of secrets ♫
