Fan Fan.

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,110
[What do I do?]

7
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,110
How did you get in?

8
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,590
You're not the only resident here.

9
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,310
Have you been waiting here all night?

10
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,550
Let's talk inside.

11
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,110
If you have anything to say,

12
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,550
say it here.

13
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,229
Why are you leaving?

14
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,870
Because I'm exhausted.

15
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,950
You clearly still love me.

16
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,830
You can't fool me.

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,710
If you don't believe me,

18
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,670
there is nothing else I can do.

19
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,750
You're afraid I'll end up
like Qin Yang, aren't you?

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,510
You're trying to protect me.

21
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,070
So, I'm still very important to you.

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,110
I need some time alone.

23
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,550
Didn't you say

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,670
you want to ride the Ferris wheel?

25
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,630
What other wishes do you
have, Princess Fan Fan?

26
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,950
Such as tourist attraction,

27
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,870
places you want to go,

28
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,710
or people you want to meet?

29
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,630
I have one.

30
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,230
But

31
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,790
it's a little childish.

32
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,430
Tell me.

33
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,510
No.

34
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,430
Come on.

35
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,630
No.

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,510
Come on.

37
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,990
I want to ride

38
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,430
the Ferris wheel.

39
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,910
Why the Ferris wheel?

40
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,550
Because

41
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,630
legend has it that

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,630
lovers

43
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,740
who kiss each other

44
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,950
when the Ferris wheel turns

45
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,940
to the highest point

46
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,750
will be together forever.

47
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,150
Okay.

48
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,270
[Just]

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,590
[one last time.]

50
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,470
[Just this once.]

51
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,390
Let's go.

52
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,110
Okay.

53
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,390
It's beautiful.

54
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,950
Do you know why

55
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,710
the Ferris wheel is the only ride
that opens until night in this park?

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,620
Why?

57
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,590
Because the owner here

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,590
met her husband on the Ferris wheel.

59
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,670
And then?

60
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,590
Before her husband passed away,

61
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,550
he told her that

62
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,150
he would not leave her.

63
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,830
He would turn into a star and
always be watching over her in the sky.

64
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,230
Her happiest times are when she watches

65
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,630
the stars on the Ferris wheel.

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,590
Look.

67
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,630
The Ferris wheel is
the closest place to the stars.

68
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,190
It's a beautiful story,

69
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,870
but

70
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,940
it's very sad too.

71
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,030
This story tells us

72
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,910
to cherish the ones you love.

73
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,870
Let's take a photo together.

74
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,590

77
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,820
You've made up your mind?

78
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,470
I thought we were just
going to take a break?

79
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,070
Why do you suddenly want to break up?

80
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,710
I tried,

81
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,470
but you know

82
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,150
I couldn't convince myself.

83
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,310
Since you've made up your mind,

84
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,630
I respect your decision.

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,510
I hope that

89

What?

161
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,030
Why did you lock him up in the basement?

162
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,550
I had no choice.

163
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,110
What if he tells people

164
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,790
about us?

165
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,830
He is our dad.

When this is over,

169
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,180
I'll let him out.

170
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,510
You asked me to steal Lu Fan Fan's 
blood information.

But...

175
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,950
Do you want me to perform
a deeper hypnosis on him?

176
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,550
No.

177
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,430
Go back and sleep then.

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,720
♫ Better slow it down ♫

191
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:56,500
♫ Or else my heart
will be crushed to pieces ♫

192
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:05,070
♫ Because losing you ♫

193
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:13,930
♫ Is just too unbearable ♫

194
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,450
♫ You said I am a fool who is not loved ♫

195
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,300
♫ Because I just can't forget you ♫

196
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,240
♫ And I can't forgive you
for what you did ♫

197
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,850
♫ You left me alone in emptiness ♫

198
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,260
♫ In a mysterious room without sunlight ♫

199
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,630
♫ Go tell the world
that I still love you ♫

200
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,440
♫ I can't get you out of my mind ♫

201
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,680
♫ But you never will find me ♫

202
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:53,450
♫ Craving the affection from you ♫

203
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,700
Look.

204
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,910
The courses we offer include

205
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,710
boxing,

206
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,510
taekwondo and so on.

207
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,990
You can take public classes 
or get a personal trainer.

208
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,110
If you prefer a personal trainer, 
we'll work out

209
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,910
a one-on-one training program for you.

210
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,870
You can take a look around
first if you're interested.

211
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,150
I'll get the schedule for you.

212
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,260
Will

213
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,830
I become as good as them?

214
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,550
As long as you keep training.

215
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,110
Take a look around.

216
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,270
Let me know which course you want to take.

217
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,110
Okay.

218
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,110
[Fan Fan,]

219
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,870
[I'll become stronger
as soon as possible.]

220
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,270
[I won't let you worry anymore.]

221
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,390
Why are you coming alone?

222
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,510
Where is Brother?

223
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,990
Whose side are you really on?

224
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,990
He won't come here anymore.

225
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,750
Why?

226
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,550
No reason.

227
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,150
Kid,

228
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,430
mind your own business.

229
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,830
Looks like

230
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,150
your heart is broken.

231
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,630
Sort of.

232
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,030
We broke up.

233
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,150
You don't like him anymore?

234
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,230
No.

235
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,590
Why did you break up then?

236
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,750
You won't understand

237
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,950
even if I tell you.

238
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,430
Quickly finish your homework.

239
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,910
Without your cooking,

240
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,790
I can't eat at all.

241
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,140
[Brother,]

242
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,910
[did you make Sister mad?]

243
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,390
[Hurry up and make up with her.]

244
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,790
[Our situation is complicated.]

245
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,270
[It's not something
we can fix in a short time.]

246
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,350
[Besides, I promised her
I would give her some time.]

247
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,310
[Brother,]

248
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,910
[you're too passive.]

249
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,470
[Aren't you afraid that someone
might snatch her away?]

250
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,910
[What are you going to do then?]

251
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,110
[Are you going to take regret
pill or forgetfulness potion?]

252
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,270
[I'm really curious]

253
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,030
[where did you learn
these vocabularies from.]

254
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,350
[Don't mind me.]

255
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,910
[We're discussing about
your personal problem now.]

256
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,670
[I don't know what has gotten to you.]

257
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,430
[Can't you just be mature
and make her feel safe?]

258
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,870
[Go get her back.]

259
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,180
They are making me worried.

260
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,990
Make her feel safe.

261
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,460
[Liu Ruo Chen said]

262
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,710
[Yu Li Qing can't drive.]

263
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,950
[So that car crash]

264
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,230
[can't be an accident.]

265
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,470
[Has Gao Ru Wen turned bad?]

266
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,940
Dr. Shen?

267
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,430
Dr. Shen?

268
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,990
Dr. Shen?

269
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,910
Dr. Shen?

270
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,750
Dr. Shen?

271
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,310
Dr. Shen?

272
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,590
[This is strange.]

273
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,470
[Dr. Shen didn't go to
work at the hospital.]

274
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,790
[He isn't home either.]

275
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,670
[Where has he been?]

276
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,180
Ruo Chen,

277
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,750
why are you watching boxing videos?

278
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,910
Only by

279
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,270
becoming stronger
can I protect the people I love.

280
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,870
Is there really no way

281
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,270
for you and Fan Fan to get back together?

282
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,910
I understand her,

283
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,590
so I respect her choice.

284
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,510
It's not a bad thing to give
each other some time to cool off.

285
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,110
Want to join me?

286
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,510
Forget it.

287
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,790
My wound has just recovered.

288
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,990
So, solving physics problems
suits me better.

289
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,700
Cheers.

290
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,790
It's been a long time.

291
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,380
The wine is nice.

292
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,350
Your restaurant looks great too.

293
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,150
So, this is your restaurant.

294
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,510
Xian Lu.

295
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,910
It's a cool name.

296
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,270
The place is nice.

297
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,950
It's not big,

298
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,630
but it's cozy.

299
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,470
Fan Fan,

300
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,750
I'm here to talk

301
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,150
to you about the car crash last time.

302
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,950
That was just an accident.

303
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,710
Besides,

304
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,510
it's over now.

305
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,110
Look at me.

306
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,990
I'm still alive and well.

307
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,100
Maybe I've become

308
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,230
even smarter than before.

309
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,630
Seeing you and Ruo Chen like this,

310
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,630
I'm feeling bad about it.

311
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,390
Qin Yang,

312
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,270
it was not.

313
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,870
It was not an accident.

314
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,350
It's because

315
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,990
I investigated Shen Shi Jia.

316
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,910
That's why Gao Ru Wen made a move earlier.

317
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,350
I don't want anyone else

318
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,980
to get hurt

319
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,510
because of

320
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,710
my decision.

321
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,790
That's why

322
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,700
you chose to break up.

323
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,510
This is good for everyone.

324
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,190
Stop trying to persuade me.

325
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,870
I just want

326
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,150
to find Gao Ru Wen.

327
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,510
But I went to Shen Shi Jia's house.

328
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,110
There wasn't anyone there.

329
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,510
How about

330
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,990
we figure out another way?

331
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,390
You've helped me a lot before.

332
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,470
I'll take care of it

333
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,350
by myself from here.

334
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,110
You have to let me know

335
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,150
if you find anything.

336
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,350
Shen Shi Jia.

337
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,350
Shen Shi Jia.

338
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,430
Why am I here?

339
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,350
Shen Shi Jia.

340
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,030
Shen Shi Jia.

341
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,110
Wen Wen.

342
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,910
Help me up.

343
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,590
Help me up.

344
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,470
Who are you calling Wen Wen?

345
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,470
I remember it now.

346
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,110
You're not Wen Wen.

347
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,870
You're not Wen Wen.

348
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,710
Shen Shi Jia,

349
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,990
just stay here.

350
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,710
[Hai Bo Bookstore]

351
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,550
Uncle Xiang.

352
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,670
Uncle Xiang.

353
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,150
I want to buy a Comic Guests.

354
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,030
Hi.

355
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,990
How may I help you?

356
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,510
Where is Uncle Xiang?

357
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,310
You mean the previous owner?

358
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,350
He lucked out.

359
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,750
He bought a lottery ticket

360
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,950
and won the jackpot.

361
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,110
He sold his shop to me

362
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,990
and went back to his
hometown to live a luxury life.

363
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,270
He's so lucky.

364
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,470
I have never won the lottery before.

365
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,150
I heard someone

366
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,470
gave him a little tip.

367
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,230
What someone?

368
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,950
He told him to play
some kind of game.

369
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,270
Right.

370
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,110
Yes.

371
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,150
He would get a phone number.

372
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,790
And that phone number
can predict the future.

373
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,910
So,

374
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,110
he got to know

375
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,270
the lottery number in advance.

376
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,990
If so,

377
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,230
wouldn't everyone

378
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,350
be a millionaire?

379
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,430
Just listen to it for fun.

380
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,990
Here's the money.

381
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,950
Okay.

382
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:47,910
Okay.

383
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,830
Come again if you need anything.

384
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,710
Okay.

385
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,310
Bye.

386
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,190
Bye.

387
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,020
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

388
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,670
I'm

389
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,630
going home now.

390
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,470
Bye bye.

391
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,350
Be careful.

392
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,550
Text me when you get home.

393
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:29,950
Okay.

394
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,500
Bye bye.

395
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,430
Bye bye.

396
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,630
Why are you two

397
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,030
still here?

398
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,270
You're not staying overnight, are you?

399
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,070
I have no empty room here.

400
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,270
-I have something to tell you.
-I have something to tell you.

401
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,830
What do you have to tell her?

402
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,990
Stop.

403
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,750
You go first.

404
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,870
Why does he get to go first?

405
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,590
I should get to go first.

406
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,070
Because

407
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,030
I want him to go first.

408
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,110
Besides, you've said enough today.

409
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,110
You can go now.

410
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,870
Fine.

411
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,750
Take all the time you need.

412
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,670
Ruo Chen

413
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,350
is like a reactor today.
