The light is on.

199

Stand against the wall first.

200
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,110
Let me try the emergency button.

201
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,830
I think there is no one there.

202
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,190

afraid of the dark just now?

I'm not afraid of the dark.

You guys are making it sound so scary.

386
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,590
I'm afraid to go home now.

387
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,940
Don't be afraid.

388
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,310
I'm here.

389
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,470
I think

390
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,830
it won't take him long

391
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,590
to show himself.

392
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,270
But

393
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,710
we're being too passive now.

394
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,090
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

395
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,990
Liu Ruo Chen,

396
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,190
shopping with me in a supermarket now,

397
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,030
won't it affect your topic selection?

398
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,030
No.

399
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,790
I've learned what I'm supposed to learn.

400
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,230
What about those you haven't learned?

401
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,710
Those I haven't learned,

402
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,070
even the lecturers
won't be able to help me.

403
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,350
You're so smart.

404
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,060
♫ If I miss the train to the future ♫

405
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,140
There's no way you will forget it.

406
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,430
What did you say?

407
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,550
♫ I will become a passenger of time ♫

408
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,310
I said

409
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,470
I'll take two packs of river snail noodles

410
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,070
to ward off evil spirits.

411
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,920
♫ If I cry a river ♫

412
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,510
Wait.

413
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,030
What?

414
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,200
♫ Will it flood the passage of time ♫

415
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,450
♫ If sadness doesn't remember happiness ♫

416
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,320
♫ I won't linger ♫

417
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,560
♫ If eyes don't remember colors ♫

418
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,630
You look pretty.

419
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,550
Let me pick one for you too.

420
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,590
♫ Leave it to the reflex of heart ♫

421
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,250
♫ If I say I don't remember ♫

422
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,510
I don't want pink.

423
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,270
Come here.

424
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,960
♫ I don't believe long separation
will always end in reunion ♫

425
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:00,050
♫ The stubborn persona
doesn't accept rebuttal♫

426
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,830
Give me a smile.

427
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,630
Give me a smile.

428
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,470
Adorable.

429
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,980
♫ If I don't even remember you ♫

430
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,670
Sit tight,

431
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,130
♫ Will I forget myself too ♫

432
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,590
kid.

433
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,190
It's too fast!

434
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,180
♫ The only thing left in
my head is that love song ♫

435
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,550
Sorry.

436
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,670
Who are you calling kid?

437
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,710
You're my kid.
