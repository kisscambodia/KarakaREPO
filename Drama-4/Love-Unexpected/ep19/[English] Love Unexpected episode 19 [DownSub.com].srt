[2012]

5
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,910
I'll get going then.

6
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,430
Bye.

7
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,310
Bye.

8
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,870
Let's go, Ruo Chen.

9
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,710
Let's grab a drink.

10
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,390
Let's go.

11
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,910
Your alcohol tolerance is a joke.

12
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,630
Don't look down on me.

13
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,150
I envy you.

14
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,310
You never get affected

15
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,870
by someone else's emotion.

16
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,470
I feel sick all the time these days.

17
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,790
Are you referring to Fan Fan?

18
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,829
You ask for it.

19
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,070
When you drink,

20
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,790
don't pull a long face.

21
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,710
If you ask me,

22
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,470
as long as you persist,

23
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,830
Fan Fan and you

24
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,990
can go through all the obstacles.

25
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,910
Drink up.

26
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,140
Women

27
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,110
are just like water.

28
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,150
You can neither grab them

29
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,310
nor sure of them.

30
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,829
But

31
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,990
I think Fan Fan is adorable.

32
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,590
Furthermore,

33
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,670
it's not hard to understand her.

34
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,510
Fan Fan is exceptionally cute.

35
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,590
She is really cute

36
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,310
but I can't figure her out.

37
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,550
Tell me.

38
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,310
What should I do?

39
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,670
You can't figure her out

40
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,270
because you have not tried hard enough.

41
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,590
Haven't I tried hard enough?

42
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,350
Liu Ruo Chen.

43
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,029
You should be grateful.

44
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,590
At least your crush likes you.

45
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,590
What about me?

46
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,710
I chose to not disturb her

47
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,950
and hide my feelings from her.

48
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,750
I have a crush too.

49
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,590
You are so lucky.

50
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,909
You have no idea how blessed you are.

51
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,430
Am I blessed?

52
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,790
I am living in pain.

53
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,470
I don't know what I should do.

54
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,030
Every day, in my heart,

55
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,870
I feel anxious.

56
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,510
What should I do?

57
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,030
Liu Ruo Chen.

58
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,270
Let me tell you.

59
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,340
Lu Fan Fan

60
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,750
stays away from you because of Gao Ru Wen.

61
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,550
She worries that Gao Ru Wen will harm you

62
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,430
if both of you get together.

63
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,950
Gao Ru Wen...

64
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm not afraid of him, 
not even a little bit.

65
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,110
No way.

66
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,830
Liu Ruo Chen.

67
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,390
I envy you.

68
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,110
I want to see Fan Fan.

69
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,390
I just want to see her for one time.

70
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,430
Just one time.

71
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,190
You are drunk.

72
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,590
How...

73
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,590
How can you see her?

74
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,750
I am going home.

75
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,310
Ruo Chen.

76
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,510
I will send you home.

77
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,950
Excuse me.

78
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,750
Bill.

79
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:20,990
Ruo Chen.

80
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,470
Where are you going?

81
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,070
Where are you going?

82
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,590
I'll send you there.

83
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,590
Please send me home.

84
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,670
Sir,

85
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,190
let's go.

86
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,430
Are you doing this on purpose?

87
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,670
Are you really drunk?

88
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,710
This is Fan Fan's house.

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,550
This is not your house.

90
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,430
This is my house.

91
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,070
Fan Fan!

92
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,230
Fan Fan!

93
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,350
Stop slamming the door.

94
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,310
It's already late. We will be arrested 
for causing nuisance.

95
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,630
Let me give Fan Fan a call.

96
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,190
Sit down.

97
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,270
Hello?

98
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,190
Hello,

99
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,750
Fan Fan.

100
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,790
Ruo Chen and I

101
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,030
are in front of your house.

102
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,790
[Please come out.]

103
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,630
Okay.

104
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,150
I'm coming right away.

105
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,190
What is going on?

106
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,030
Ruo Chen...

107
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,909
He is drunk.

108
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,150
He insisted to see you.

109
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,190
I'm at my wits' end.

110
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,550
That's why I called you.

111
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,630
Why did he drink so much?

112
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,150
Fan Fan.

113
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,390
Fan Fan.

114
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,270
Fan Fan.

115
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,350
Let's go inside. We'll talk later.

116
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,550
Fan Fan.

117
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,270
Slow down.

118
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,270
Fan Fan.

119
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,180
Fan Fan.

120
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,750
Fan Fan.

121
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,150
Fan Fan.

122
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,150
I told him to go home

123
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,580
but he insisted to come to your place.

124
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,510
He knew

125
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,580
that I won't let him in

126
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,909
if he is not drunk.

127
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,150
That's why he did this.

128
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,710
In that case,

129
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,750
I have accomplished the mission.

130
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,670
Take care of him.

131
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,670
Okay.

132
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,070
Take care.

133
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,470
Rest early.

134
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,950
Text me when you are home.

135
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:56,990
Okay.

136
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,990
I'll get going then.

137
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,430
Bye.

138
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,310
Bye.

139
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,230
Liu Ruo Chen.

140
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,230
Stop pretending.

141
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,750
Are you drunk?

142
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,790
Fan Fan.

143
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,020
Fan Fan.

144
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,750
Don't chase me away.

145
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,470
Don't chase me away.

146
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,950
Okay?

147
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,740
I'm not chasing you away.

148
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,990
Silly boy.

149
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,670
Rest well.

150
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,950
Good night.

151
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,150
Fan Fan.

152
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,310
Fan Fan.

153
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,390
It's burning.

154
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,550
Is he having a fever?

155
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,670
Come on.

156
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,870
Get up.

157
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,550
Take some medicine.

158
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,750
You may continue sleeping 
after taking medicine.

159
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,110
Here.

160
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,540
Here.

161
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,830
Water.

162
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,670
I want water.

163
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,710
Okay, I will get some water for you.

164
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,310
Hold on.

165
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,550
Here is the water.

166
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,310
How did I end up in Fan Fan's house?

167
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,390
Fan Fan, don't go.

168
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,350
Fan Fan.

169
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,950
Don't chase me away.

170
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,430
Don't chase me away, okay?

171
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,910
Silly boy.

172
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,750
No one is chasing you away.

173
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,430
Rest well.

174
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,310
Good night.

175
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,270
Fan Fan.

176
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,510
What are you doing here?

177
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,070
Get some rest.

178
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,830
I'm fine now.

179
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,990
You are getting better.

180
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,070
I'm afraid you may 
have no appetite due to fever.

181
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,670
That's why I cooked century egg porridge

182
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,630
with some side dishes.

183
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,790
After eating,

184
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,590
you may go back to sleep.

185
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,550
In the future,

186
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,110
don't you dare to drink so much.

187
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,310
When I had barbecue with Qing Yang,

188
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,590
I had a little beer.

189
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,380
A little?

190
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,590
Yet, you were terribly drunk.

191
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,670
God knows if you had barbecue

192
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,550
or just beers.

193
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,350
How do I get in here 
if I didn't drink?

194
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,270
Fine.

195
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,740
Wait outside, the food is almost ready.

196
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,310
Yes, sir.

197
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,580
[I'm at your sister's place.
Everything goes well.]

198
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,910
[No wonder she takes a day off.]

199
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,550
[It turns out you are at her place.]

200
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,510
You are a teaching assistant.

201
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,470
You should take care of your appearance.

202
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,750
Your hair is as messy as a chicken coop.

203
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,310
I'm sick.

204
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,670
Why don't

205
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,270
you wash my hair?

206
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,190
Wash your hair?

207
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,790
Are you armless?

208
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,710
Go home and wash your hair.

209
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,110
I'm sick.

210
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,630
No one is taking care of me.

211
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,630
What if I pass out?

212
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,910
How about this?

213
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,790
Why don't

214
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,470
I bathe you as well?

215
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,150
If you are willing to do it,

216
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,590
I don't mind.

217
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,110
Dream on.

218
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,070
The shampoo smells so good.

219
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,990
I think it's clean.

220
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,420
I think

221
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,750
you can exert more strength.

222
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,940
Like this?

223
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,590
Move slightly to the right.

224
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,310
Like this?

225
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,030
Move slightly more to the right.

226
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,790
Like this?

227
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,430
Yes.

228
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,030
Mr. Liu.

229
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,660
I think

230
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,069
you really enjoyed the service.

231
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,190
Well,

232
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,950
I shall continue.

233
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,990
What about this?

234
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,230
Okay.

235
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,829
Thank you for the service.

236
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,869
Let's rinse the hair.

237
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,190
What do you think?

238
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,870
Is my hairstyle okay?

239
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,750
It's acceptable.

240
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,390
You look like Pikachu.

241
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,910
You are comparing me to Pikachu.

242
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,150
You are incomparable to it.

243
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,830
That's better.

244
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,230
It is more adorable than you.

245
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,030
Am I not adorable?

246
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,830
All right.

247
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,390
Turn around.

248
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,670
Liu Ruo Chen.

249
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,790
When are you going home?

250
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,030
I still feel a little dizzy.

251
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,670
You are dizzy?

252
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,190
Are you still dizzy?

253
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,270
No, the dizziness is gone.

254
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,470
I will go home after lunch.

255
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,790
[I just want to spend more time with you.]

256
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,910
Happy weekend party!

257
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,390
You should have come empty handed.

258
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,510
Why did you bring food?

259
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,820
Why are you here?

260
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,790
I invited them.

261
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,190
It's been a while since we had gathering.

262
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,670
How is your mom doing?

263
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,990
She is getting better.

264
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,310
Furthermore,

265
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,510
ever since my dad went there,

266
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,870
her life is getting better.

267
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,590
My dad promised us,

268
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,910
when he is out of prison,

269
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,590
he will quit gambling.

270
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,510
We will live a good life together.

271
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,870
That's great.

272
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,430
If you face any difficulty, let us know.

273
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,310
Don't be shy.

274
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,870
Don't worry.

275
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,630
I can tell that

276
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,670
Mr. Liu really likes you.

277
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,510
Why did you break up with him?

278
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,470
Actually,

279
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,670
I did that for a reason.

280
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,430
After experiencing so much,

281
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,350
I'm really glad 
that we have become friends.

282
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,660
Therefore,

283
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,790
I hope

284
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,150
you can live happily.

285
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,910
Same goes to you.

286
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,150
I hope

287
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,630
you can live happily too.

288
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,950
Lu Fan Fan's weekend party

289
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,910
also known as the first 
dumpling cooking contest

290
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,910
will begin soon.

291
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,060
Are you two ready?

292
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,420
-Yes.
-Yes.

293
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,270
The winner

294
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,630
will get The Lu's 36-Style-Recipe.

295
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,790
The loser

296
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,070
will have to tell the opponent

297
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,750
"I admit defeat"

298
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,950
for three times.

299
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,950
Get ready.

300
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,630
Go!

301
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,470
Who would have thought

302
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,110
that they are

303
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,910
so skillful in cooking.

304
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,190
This...

305
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,190
This is...

306
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,620
That's so impressive.

307
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,550
Is that for real?

308
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,470
What do you usually do?

309
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,110
I have a wide variety of hobbies.

310
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,430
I vote for Qin Yang.

311
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,150
We unanimously decided

312
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,430
that the winner is

313
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,390
Qin Yang.

314
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,510
I admit defeat.

315
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,710
I admit defeat.

316
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,260
I admit defeat.

317
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,830
No matter what,

318
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,430
regardless the winner,

319
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:16,990
there are

320
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,950
so many dumplings,

321
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,590
we have to finish them.

322
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,510
