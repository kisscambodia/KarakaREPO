Durian, here I come!

00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,910
Did you buy durian in secret again?

7
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,670
I did not.

8
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,390
If you don't admit,

I'll throw away your half pack of durian.

10
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,030
You should take a shower.

I haven't had durian for a month.

Are you

21
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,870
shy?

22
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,270
I am not.

or watching movie?

137
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,950
Didn't I say I wanted
to spend time with you?

138
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,309
What movie are we watching?

139
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,710
Switch off the light.

Here comes the best part.

142
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,950
Is the movie
you're talking about a horror movie?

143
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,870
You know

144
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,350
that I'm afraid of it.

145
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,230
Didn't someone

146
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,030
once claim
that he is not afraid of horror movies?

147
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,030
All right.

154
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,790
Choose something

155
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,350
that is romantic

156
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,670

As such, I won't let you have a good time.

189
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,830
Who are you?

190
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,150
What are you doing?

191
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,590
You gave me a hard time.

192
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,990
As such, I won't let you have a good time.

193
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,670
Gao Ru Wen.

194
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,430
You are Gao Ru Wen from the year of 2024.

195
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,270
You are quite smart.

196
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,790
Lu Fan Fan.

197
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,020
Nice to meet you again.

198
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,390
What do you want?

199
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,390
Are you afraid?

200
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,470
Don't worry.

201
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,710
You won't be suffering for too long.

202
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,950
I will put an end to everything.

203
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,990
Tell me.

204
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,430
What do you want?

205
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,510
Hello?

206
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,550
Hello?

207
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,470
Gao Ru Wen?

208
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,950
Has he escaped?

209
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,070
It's someone scarier than him.

210
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,030
It's Gao Ru Wen from the year of 2024.

211
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,270
Who would have thought
this would happen.

212
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,710
Gao Ru Wen is the kind of person who'll
seek revenge for the smallest  grievances.

213
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,910
He will surely

214
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,350
seek revenge against Fan Fan
in every possible way.

215
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,870
He is so terrifying.

216
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,550
When I think about it,

217
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,710
he did that to me even though

218
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,750
we did not have any conflict.

219
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,350
He will do something worse to you.

220
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,190
Well...

221
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,630
Even if he is a fool,

222
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,230
I don't think
he will throw himself in our way.

223
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,030
Never lower your guard.

224
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,080
A baited cat may grow
as fierce as a lion.

225
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,630
Don't forget that Gao Ru Wen is a felon.

226
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,750
With his intelligence,

227
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,230
in the coming days,

228
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,150
he will try to escape at all cost

229
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,310
and find a breakthrough
to his advantage.

230
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,540
Are you saying

231
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,310
I'm the breakthrough?

232
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,230
Judging from the current situation,

233
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,110
he called you

234
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,310
because of that.

235
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,310
That...

236
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,990
That's so arrogant of him.

237
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,350
Do I look like

238
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,070
a pushover?

239
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,830
I...

240
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,470
What about this?

241
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,470
Move in with me.

242
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,310
Qin Yang.

243
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:37,990
Yi Xiao.

244
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:38,870
Move to my place.

245
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,070
We should stay together.

246
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,670
If you stay at home,

247
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,550
he won't stand a chance

248
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,070
even if he aims to attack you.

249
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,510
Under the circumstances,

250
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,790
this is by far the best way.

251
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,990
Enjoy while you can.

252
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,150
Tomorrow is another day.

253
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,270
Not bad.

254
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,790
What were you doing?

255
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,470
We were exchanging code words

256
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,470
that was fresh out of the oven.

257
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,910
If someone can't answer the code words,

258
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,070
don't open the door.

259
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,350
I see.

260
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,630
It's quite easy to remember.

261
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,310
Come on in.

262
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,830
Yi Xiao.

263
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,430
Give me the suitcase.

264
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,830
Did you encounter

265
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,870
anything unusual tonight?

266
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,270
I came here by taxi.

267
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,630
I came here right after
picking up Yi Xiao.

268
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,350
I have verified
the vehicle registration number

269
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,030
and the license.

270
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,070
He is just a normal driver.

271
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,430
I didn't notice anyone unusual either.

272
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,390
When did you do that?

273
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,470
I didn't notice it at all.

274
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,180
Of course I had to do that in secret.

275
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,990
That...

276
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,550
That was so exciting.

277
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,430
It's as if we were in a spy movie.

278
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,550
It's not that exciting

279
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,030
but

280
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,310
it's better to stay cautious.

281
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,310
You have reminded me of something.

282
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,190
It's a little to passive

283
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,150
to guard against Gao Ru Wen.

284
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,390
Moreover, Yi Xiao and Fan Fan
are easy targets for him

285
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,150
as they are ladies.

286
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,190
In that case,

287
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,460
what should I do?

288
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,830
How about

289
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,670
I pretend to approach him?

290
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,150
Anyway, I have no money,

291
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,310
but a life.

292
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,990
If you lose your life,

293
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,550
what should someone do?

294
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,110
You are right.

295
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,110
Fan Fan and I

296
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,710
will stay together
until death do us apart.

297
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,390
Well,

298
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,910
don't you forget about it.

299
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,590
When you girls are outside,
you need to protect yourself.

300
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,070
If you encounter this kind of situation,

301
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,750
what should you do?

302
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,310
Lu Fan Fan.

303
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,310
Are we

304
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,910
going to learn this?

305
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,150
Of course.

306
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,070
This is self-defence
martial arts for ladies.

307
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,630
If you master it,

308
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,990
Gao Ru Wen is all alone

309
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,870
and he won't be able to defeat us.

310
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,350
Ruo Chen,

311
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,870
are you sure

312
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,870
this is useful?

313
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,750
I think it's not too useful

314
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,150
but we can't give up.

315
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,950
Actually,

316
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,910
we can

317
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,230
carry weapons with us.

318
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,390
For example,

319
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,700
pepper spray.

320
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,430
I have it.

321
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,470
Alarm.

322
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,510
I have it too.

323
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,030
Stop.

324
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,460
Did you forget

325
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,070
Gao Ru Wen
is good at hypnotising?

326
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,790
All he has to do

327
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,470
is to stare at you

328
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,870
and you will pass out immediately.

329
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,230
Give it to me.

330
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,270
Qin Yang.

331
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,630
Come out.

332
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,510
Put your hand on me.

333
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,069
If you encounter this situation,

334
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,589
lift your left hand.

335
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,630
Then,

336
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,150
in the next second,

337
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,790
in the blink of an eye,

338
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,470
press his wrist,

339
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,349
lift your leg

340
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,030
and attack him with your elbow.

341
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,110
That's a complete demonstration
of the move.

342
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,790
Next.

343
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,790
The next move...

344
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,390
Ruo Chen.

345
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:44,990
This...

346
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,190
I don't think it suits us.

347
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,070
What about...

348
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,550
Let's play a game.

349
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,230
Sure.

350
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,550
What is it?

351
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,910
Water carry game.

352
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,190
Water carry game,

353
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,820
as suggested by its name,

354
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,350
means carry a bowl of water horizontally.

355
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,350
What we have to do is

356
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,430
pour water from one cup to another.

357
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,230
The first person to spill the water

358
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,750
is the loser.

359
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,670
The loser...

360
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,350
The loser will have to

361
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,710
clean the kitchen

362
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,270
and do dishes!

363
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,070
Sure.

364
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,310
It sounds simple.

365
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,870
Let's begin.

366
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,670
Who wants to be the first?

367
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,580
Fan Fan is the focus of the day.

368
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,710
Let Fan Fan go first.

369
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,670
You are so mean.

370
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,270
After all, it's a game.

371
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:39,910
Come on.

372
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,150
Mr. Qin.

373
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,790
I got it under control.

374
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,470
Come on.

375
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,830
It's easy.

376
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,590
You guys are

377
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,710
working together to trick me.

378
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,790
Good luck.

379
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,550
You are something!

380
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,590
This...

381
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,030
This...

382
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,910
I can do it.

383
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,110
Ruo Chen.

384
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,670
You lose.

385
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,870
I was giving way to you.

386
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,790
Harm set,

387
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,990
harm get.

388
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,270
It seems that

389
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,590
the kitchen

390
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,990
belongs to you today.

391
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,510
A bet is a bet. I admit defeat.

392
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,790
Thank you for the hard work.

393
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,990
A bet is a bet. I admit defeat.

394
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,990
All right.

395
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,510
Take your time.

396
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,590
I'm going out.

397
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,670
No way.

398
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,390
It won't be long.

399
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,470
I will come home soon.

400
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,470
Like I said, it's very dangerous.

401
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,470
No way.

402
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,070
But...

403
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,550
I need to buy something.

404
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,190
What thing?

405
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,350
I'm on period.

406
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,750
I need to buy

407
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,420
that thing.

408
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,190
You...

409
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,670
What thing do you mean?

410
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,990
Something for ladies.

411
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,830
That thing.

412
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,030
Something for ladies.

413
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,270
What is it?

414
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,110
Sanitary pad.

415
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:53,790
I...

416
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,630
I got it now.

417
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,430
Well...

418
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,870
I can get it for you.

419
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,670
Give me a minute.

420
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,950
Give me a minute.

421
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,710
Goodness.

422
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,430
He is so handsome.

423
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,070
He looks even more handsome
than the actor in the drama.

424
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,110
There are so many brands.

425
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,190
This...

426
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,070
This...

427
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,470
They are alike.

428
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,270
Which one does Fan Fan use?

429
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,590
Sir.

430
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,030
Do you need help?

431
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,910
Are you buying pad for your girlfriend?

432
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,390
If she has a heavy flow,

433
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,590
I recommend this one

434
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,310
and this one.

435
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,390
It can prevent period leaks.

436
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,550
There is an ongoing promotion.

437
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,510
You can buy one and get one free.

438
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,910
If you want something comfy,

439
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,060
you may choose this.

440
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,070
Which one

441
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,190
do you need?

442
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:19,550
Come in.

443
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,870
You...

444
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,470
Thank you.

445
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,630
I'm going to meet Qin Yang.

446
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,020
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

447
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,950
What are you drawing?

448
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,230
Give it back to me.

449
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,750
Give it back to me.

450
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,300
You remember everything.

451
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,190
I always remember it.

452
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,150
In that case,

453
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,470
let me keep you company forever,

454
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,870
okay?

455
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,830
What are you drawing?

456
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,030
Can't you tell?

457
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,030
It's a cello.

458
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,150
It's the instrument that you play.

459
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,070
Does cello look like this?

460
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,430
It looks like a bee.

461
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,150
I think it looks like cello.

462
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,630
No way.

463
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,230
Why are there antenna?

464
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,550
Silly girl.

465
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,550
You should draw like this.

466
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,590
Like this.

467
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,590
To the left.

468
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,670
Like this.

469
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,990
Followed by a curve.

470
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,470
And lastly,

471
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,350
draw this.

472
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,470
That's right.

473
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,350
Right?

474
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,630
♫ Watch the clear blue sky
from the window ♫

475
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,870
You forgot it.

476
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,590
Will you teach me how to play cello?

477
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,470
♫ All I hear is your whispers ♫

478
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,910
You want to learn it?

479
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,550
Sure.

480
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,480
♫ Living under the same roof ♫

481
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,340
Lower your hand.

482
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,350
Like this?

483
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,430
♫ Your presence
is a whole new experience ♫

484
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,790
That's not how you hold the bow.

485
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,610
♫ Just like yesterday,
memories push me forward  ♫

486
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,470
Lower your hand.

487
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,280
♫ It reminds me of a wish
I made many years ago ♫

488
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,950
♫ Your backlight makes you glow ♫

489
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,590
Like this?

490
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,830
Yes.

491
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,760
♫ I can never forget your smile ♫

492
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,910
What about this?

493
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,830
Be serious.

494
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,350
♫ You are the stars
lighting up the long night ♫

495
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,150
It's so hard.

496
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,750
I don't want to play anymore.

497
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,360
♫ I wish I could go against time
and grow up with you again  ♫

498
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,150
You have never changed.

499
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,020
♫ The street that we passed by
when we were kids ♫

500
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,590
By the way,

501
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,790
I got you a present.

502
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,700
♫ It has aged gracefully
as time passed ♫

503
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,070
What is it?

504
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,670
Back then,

505
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,230
you always sat by my side

506
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,830
♫ My childhood is all about you ♫

507
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,150
and watched me play cello.

508
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,550
But

509
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,290
♫ I collect the fragments of memories ♫

510
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,030
I haven't played cello for you for long.

511
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,470
Would you like to hear it?

512
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,390
♫ You are my one and only ♫

513
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,630
[Fan Fan,]

514
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,510
[thank you for getting my brother back.]

515
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,190
[I am really happy now.]

516
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,950
[I hope you are happy too.]
