[2012]

5
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,630
I am the closest person to you.

6
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,070
If it wasn't because you care about him,

7
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,630
I would've already sent
him to see Yu Li Qing.

8
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,950
Don't talk about my mum!

9
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,310
What do you think you're doing?

10
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,270
Don't forget

11
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,990
I've still got Shen Shi Jia.

12
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,870
I won't be threatened by you again.

13
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,710
At worst, I'll just
fight you to the death.

14
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,070
If I die,

15
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,430
you won't live either.

16
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,540
I was just joking.

17
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,110
How...

18
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,750
How could I make things difficult for you?

19
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,150
We're one person.

20
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,820
You are me,

21
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,740
I am you.

22
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,510
We still have to live well together.

23
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,990
Dad,

24
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,870
do you still remember me?

25
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,950
I'm Wen Wen.

27
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,790
What's wrong, dad?

28
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,630
Dad?

29
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,670
Dad?

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,550
Don't scare me, dad.

35
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,230
Are you okay?

Dad?

37
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,790
Are you okay, dad?

38

It's me, dad.

It's me.

It's me, dad.

Get me out of here.

Get me out of here.

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,190
Look at me.

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,510
You need to get me out of here.

51
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,030
There is hope for us

52
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,550
as long as we get out of here.

53
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,270
Trust me.

54
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,670
We'll leave together.

55
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,190
Okay.

00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,350
Really?

58
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,070
Very good.

59
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,470
It's not good

60
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,790
for a kid to lie.

61
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,310
You tried to knock me out to get him out.

62
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,430
You're sleepy now.

63
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,830
You're feeling exhausted.

64
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,830
You just

65
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,590
want to go to sleep now.

66
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,630
Don't forget that

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,470
I know how to hypnotize too.

68
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,750
Dad.

69
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,030
I did it.

70
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,950
I stalled him.

71
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,070
Come on.

72
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,150
Once we get out of here,

73
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,590
we can start over.

74
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,230
He's not going to 
take us back again, is he?

75
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,310
We can alert the police.

76
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,190
He has no identification.

77
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,190
It will put him in trouble.

78
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,030
We'll have enough time to escape.

79
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,470
If only your mother

80
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,990
was here with us.

81
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,110
She'll protect us

82
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,190

83
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,510

Fan Fan,

88
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,510
Gao Ru Wen has been arrested.

[Police]

91
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,910
I never thought

92
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,750
someone would report Gao Ru Wen
anonymously to the police.

93
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,270
And Gao Ru Wen would
surrender cooperatively.

94
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,750
Was it reported by the family of

95
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,070
the victim of the previous cases?

96
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,100
Anyway,

97
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,230
now that the police are involved,

98
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,550
we can be less worried.

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,590
That's right.

100
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,510
I feel scared whenever I go on stage now.

101
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,950
When the police get conclusive
evidence on Gao Ru Wen,

102
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,670
he'll get the punishment he deserves.

103
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,260
Yes.

104
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,030

105
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,030
to live in

106
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,150

Yi Xiao,

109
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,750
we did hide something from you,

110
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,390
because it really
needed to be kept secret.

111
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,350
You guys aren't

112
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,670
just messing with me, are you?

113
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,870
Is it true what you say?

114
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,310
Yes.

Fan Fan,

116
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,070
you came from another time and space?

117
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,710
I didn't believe it either at first,

118
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,390
but many things proved that

119
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,300
Fan Fan really came

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,980
from 2024.

121
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,990
But don't

122
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,790
all these things

123
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,270
only happen in movies?

124
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,750
Speaking from a physics perspective...

125
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,630
-Stop.
-Stop.

126
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,910
I'm just worried that Yi Xiao
wouldn't understand.

127
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,630
Since you have said so,

128
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,870
I can only believe you.

129
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,590
Oh my God.

130
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,670
I can't believe I have a
friend from 12 years later.

131
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,820
This is incredible.

132
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,909
And she is now sitting right beside me.

133
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,310
So how old are you really?

134
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,860
How come your skin is so smooth?

135
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,070
How do you take care of it?

136
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,990
That's enough.

137
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,550
It's good that you know.

138
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,390
Since

139
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,950
Gao Ru Wen has been arrested,

140
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,670
should we

141
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,070
have some fun now?

142
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,910
Let's go to the

143
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,590
old haunt.

144
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,190
The old haunt it is.

145
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,190
Have you found him?

146
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,350
No.

147
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,830
I've checked over there.

148
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,750
He's not there.

149
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,030
What about you?

150
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,790
There isn't

151
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,750
any exit on that side.

152
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,590
Where can he possibly be?

153
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,350
If you had told us
about this place earlier,

154
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,190
we would've come sooner.

155
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,630
It's not too late to come now.

156
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,790
Do you come here often?

157
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,790
Of course.

158
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,310
Ruo Chen has been trying to outrank me,

159
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,150
but he didn't have the chance.

160
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,390
We'll see about it on the track.

161
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,790
Fan Fan,

162
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,470
we get to watch

163
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,990
the battle between two master players.

164
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,590
Why aren't you excited
to see me on the track too?

165
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,230
Alright.

166
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,190
I'll go warm up first.

167
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,070
I'll wait for you there.

168
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,470
The race suit suits you well.

169
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,110
You look really cool in it.

170
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,550
Try the helmet.

171
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,910
You sound really convincing.

172
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,190
Compliments

173
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,550
make women more confident.

174
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,230
Where did you hear that nonsense from?

175
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,590
Besides,

176
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,870
since when am I not confident?

177
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,790
Since Gao Ru Wen turned himself in,

178
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,750
you're in a much better mood.

179
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,710
Of course.

180
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,710
That's a relief to me.

181
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,350
Come on.

182
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,750
I'll see you on the track.

183
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,430
Wait for me.

184
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,500
Fan Fan,

185
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,630
want me to give you a head start?

186

Liu Ruo Chen,

187
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,550
I'll wait for you at the finish line.

188
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,670
Okay.

189
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,830
See you at the finish line.

190
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,070
I'm exhausted.

191
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,750
I didn't know kart racing
could be so tiring.

192
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,870
It will get better
once you drive a few more times.

193
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,660
But Ruo Chen did pretty well today.

194
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,430
It's just a matter of time
before I break your record.

195
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,030
Fan Fan did a good job too.

196
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,390
Fan Fan,

197
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,590
when will we come again?

198
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,550
We'll

199
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,390
see.

200
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,150
I have to go to work.

201
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,190
I'm going back to
Xian Lu Dessert now.

202
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,980
Bye bye.

203
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,900
Let me take you back.

204
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,950
It's fine.

205
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,870
Ruo Chen,

206
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,150
the problem about Gao Ru Wen
has been resolved.

207
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,710
You two

208
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,910
haven't made up yet?

209
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,390
We haven't.

210
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,350
She should know that I'm waiting
for her to come back to me.

211
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,070
What do you mean she should know?

212
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,830
The festival is coming up.

213
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,590
You should give her a ritual.

214
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,710
A ritual?

215
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,590
Rituals are important for girls.

216
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,310
You don't really need
to prepare something big,

217
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,710
but

218
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,910
you have to let Fan Fan
know how much you love her.

219
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,070
No matter how many times
she needs to confirm it,

220
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,030
you just have to let her know.

221
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,830
Who doesn't want to be cared for

222
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,670
and cherished?

223
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,390
Sister, is the steak ready?

224
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,070
Coming.

225
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,270
Here's your medium well
heart-shaped steak.

226
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,350
Watch your drool.

227
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,990
We can close early today.

228
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,270
Don't we have guests tonight?

229
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,790
Tonight,

230
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,030
I'm taking my wife

231
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,230
and Fan Fan out

232
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,990
for a romantic evening.

233
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,870
Lu,

234
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,470
why don't you ask Liu
out and spend the festival

235
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,950
with him tonight?

236
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,230
That's right.

237
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,310
Stop staying at home all the time.

238
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,510
I got it.

239
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,990
[Celebrating the festival.]

240
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,470
[I wonder]

241
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,790
[if he would ask me to spend it with him.]

242
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,030
Pikachu,

243
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,510
why am I so miserable?

244
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,390
No way.

245
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,990
This is such a romantic festival.

246
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,910
There's no way I'll spend it alone.

247
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,590
[Yi Xiao,]

248
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,950
[come to my place.]

249
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,350
[Let's celebrate the festival together.]

250
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,110
Why don't

251
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,670
we ask

252
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,190
what is Aunt Yi Xiao doing now?

253
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,390
[I can't.]

254
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,950
[Our school is holding
a masquerade ball.]

255
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,710
[All freshmen are attending.]

256
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,830
[There are many handsome guys there.]

257
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,390
[Alright.]

258
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,110
[Do you have any plans today?]

259
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,430
Uncle Qin Yang

260
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,470
must be available.

261
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,350
[Ruo Chen and I are
at the masquerade ball.]

262
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,310
[Want to join us?]

263
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,310
[Let me show you.]

264
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,590
[The most eye-catching
handsome men at tonight's ball.]

265
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,230
[What about you?]

266
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,630
[You're not alone at home, are you?]

267
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,070
Pikachu,

268
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,350
looks like

269
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,150
you and me

270
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,750
are going to

271
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,190
spend the festival alone.

272
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,950
I'll

273
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,590
take you out

274
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,430
for a walk.

275
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,070
[I already told Fan Fan.]

276
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,350
[I've already hinted Fan Fan.]

277
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,470
[The rest]

278
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,510
[is up to you.]

279
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,470
Go for it.

280
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,990
Pikachu,

281
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,830
it actually bloomed.

282
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,860
Pikachu,

283
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,670
this flower

284
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,990
was planted by Uncle Liu.

285
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,760
[Liu Ruo Chen]

286
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,590
Hello.

287
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,190
Hello.

288
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,270
[Is the ball over?]

289
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,590
No.

290
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,630
Why do you have time to call me then?

291
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,670
The ball is boring.

292
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,710
There are too many people
who want to dance with me.

293
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,230
Have a good time then.

294
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,350
Don't hang up.

295
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,750
Where are you

296
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,990
spending the festival?

297
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,670
At home.

298
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,350
Do you want to see snow?

299
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,550
Is it snowing?

300
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,180
I know a VIP spot to enjoy the snow.

301
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,109
[Sure.]

302
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,270
So

303
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,990
the weather forecast didn't say

304
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,190
it would snow today.

305
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,590
It's just up ahead.

306
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,550
We're almost there.

307
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,670
Is it really okay

308
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,030
for you to leave the ball

309
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,070
like this?

310
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,190
I'm the only one who doesn't
have a partner to dance with.

311
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,110
Besides, compared to

312
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,350
watching the snow with you,

313
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,030
you're more important.

314
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,350
Are we there yet?

315
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,150
It's time for the miracle.

316
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,550
It's beautiful.

317
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,070
Do you like it?

318
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,910
I'm glad you like it.

319
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,150
Fan Fan,

320
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,470
let's make up.

321
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,700
Lu Fan Fan,

322
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,710
be my girlfriend.

323
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,510
You couldn't hear me?

324
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,350
Lu Fan Fan, be my girlfriend...

325
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,430
I heard you.

326
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,710
♫ When life gets hard ♫

327
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,860

[I keep thinking]

♫ I shouldn't resign myself to it ♫
