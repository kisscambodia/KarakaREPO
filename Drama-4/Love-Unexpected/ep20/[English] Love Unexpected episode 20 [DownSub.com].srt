Didn't you say that person didn't go

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,100
to the restaurant that day?

7
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,370
Why are you looking at these pictures?

8
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,620
He didn't show up

9
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,820
does not mean he didn't go.

10
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,570
Is there the person
we're looking for in here?

11
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,060
Look at this.

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,940
It is exactly the same as I guessed.

13
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,740
This person is always around us

14
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,620

15
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,100

16
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,900
Actually, there is one thing
I don't quite understand.

Why is he targeting us?

18

I don't even know him.

19
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,580
Maybe he's not targeting you.

What do you mean?

21
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,740
It's a long story.

There are many other things involved.

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,420
When there is a chance,

24
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,860
you can ask Ruo Chen
and Fan Fan to tell you.

25
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,780
Right,

why haven't they come yet?

27
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,140
The two of them probably

28
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,380
don't have time to care about this.

29
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,380
What about you?

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,300

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,220
Everyone can tell

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,370
you like Fan Fan.

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,380
Why didn't you confess your love to her?

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,020
You don't have to say it

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,340
when you like someone.

36
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,930
As long as she lives happily.

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,380
You're right.

38
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,700
Are Liu Ruo Chen
and the others looking for you?

39
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,660
Yes.

40
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,940
I knew they wouldn't be easy to deal with.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,100
Is that so?

42
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,250
But I have followed her for a long time,

43
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,380
I feel that she is an ordinary person.

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,620
She has secrets that we don't know.

45
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,130
No wonder you want her blood test report.

46
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,700
So, what is her secret?

47
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,260
I wanted to wait for
the right time to tell you.

48
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,370
Lu Fan Fan is the same as me,

49
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,620
she came from the
parallel time and space too.

50

Nothing has happened
to her so far since she arrived,

51
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,220
but my health is getting worse.

52
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,660
I need a healthy body.

I'm used to it.

57
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,210
The last medical report

58
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,820
just shows some basic data.

59
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,460
It can't be of much use.

60
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,220
If we can get her here,

61
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,380
things will be easy.

no one will be able to heal Dad.

65
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,540
Can I talk to my dad

66
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,860

When I see the way you are now,

72
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,820
I can't hate you anymore.

73

something wrong in the past,

it would have been great.

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,060
It's all my fault for being selfish.

leading a very happy life.

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,460
You are awesome.

194
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
I am going to extend it.

195
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,220
What are you doing?

196
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,610
You promised not to hypnotise Dad anymore.

197
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,140
You lied to me again?

198
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,090
You are very sleepy now

199
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,500
and want to go to bed.

200
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,300
I was also hypnotised by him.

201
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,900
Dad.

202
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,300
Dad.

203
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,420
Dad, come here.

204
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:24,980
Dad.

205
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,020
I will take you out.

206
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,020
The game of cat and mouse is over.

207
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,410
Follow me back.

208
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,550
[Liu Ruo Chen]

209
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,350
[Liu Ruo Chen]

210
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,220
Liu Ruo Chen.

211
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,820
Liu Ruo Chen.

212
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,660
[Yes?]

213
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
You're awake?

214
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,300
[I woke up a long time ago.]

215
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,140
[You listen to this.]

216
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,180
[I found something important yesterday.]

217
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,260
Is it about Gao Ru Wen?

218
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,250
[Listen to this.]

219
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,540
[Fan Fan,]

220
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,820
[a pig slept in your house last night.]

221
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,980
[Can you hear it?]

222
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,420
Liu Ruo Chen!

223
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,860
Alright.

224
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,180
I'm off to wash up.

225
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,580
Bye.

226
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,380
[Fan Fan!]

227
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,860
Wake up.

228
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,060
Dad.

229
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,060
Why do you want to torture him?

230
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,660
Why don't you ask him why he tortured me?

231
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,500
I wanted to kill him long ago.

232
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,420
Don't hurt him.

233
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,380
As long as you don't hurt him,

234
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,980
I can do anything.

235
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,380
If I find it out again,

236
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,340
I'll break his legs.

237
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,660
I…

238
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,020
I will not run away anymore.

239
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,300
Please give me a chance to prove it.

240
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,340
Catch Lu Fan Fan.

241
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,820
If you don't behave and obey me,

242
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,540
I will make sure
you will never see him again.

243
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,940
Let's go.

244
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,500
Pikachu.

245
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,420
Hello.

246
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,140
Who are you?

247
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,860
[Hello.]

248
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,820
[I'm calling from a
family-friendly outdoor tour agency.]

249
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,740
[We have an event
that is perfect for you recently.]

250
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,980
[Are you interested in
learning more about it?]

251
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,100
I am very interested to know about it,

252
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,820
but I don't have a child yet.

253
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,300
I'll contact you when I have a child.

254
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,300
[Alright.]

255
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,420
[I'm sorry to disturb you.]

256
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,180
It's okay.

257
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,140
Bye.

258
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,740
[Bye.]

259
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,380
I don't have a child but I have

260
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,220
Pikachu.

261
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,820
Pikachu!

262
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,260
Pikachu!

263
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,620
Little Pi!

264
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,180
Little Pi.

265
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
This can't be such a coincidence, right?

266
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,500
I'm just going to see you.

267
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,620
Where is your mother?

268
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Little Pi.

269
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,860
There's a question
I've been wanting to ask you.

270
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,620
How can you make Fan Fan happy

271
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,130
without doing anything?

272
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,460
Here.

273
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,650
Let me give you a handful of dog food

274
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,300
as a token of appreciation.

275
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,980
Let's eat.

276
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
Eat slowly.

277
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,460
Liu Ruo Chen!

278
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,540
Pikachu!

279
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,140
Liu Ruo Chen,

280
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,660
you are too scheming.

281
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,420
You even use dog food to bribe Pikachu.

282
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,900
Did you follow us all the way?

283
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
I didn't.

284
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,770
Then, why are you here

285
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,180
so early in the morning?

286
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,380
This dog food…

287
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,900
Pikachu.

288
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,740
My house is over there.

289
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,700
Yes,

290
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
I was coming for you.

291
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,580
I bought this for Pikachu too.

292
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,300
However,

293
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,060
I met Little Pi by chance.

294
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,740
It turns out that you lost him.

295
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,820
I…

296
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,500
I didn't lose him.

297
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,820
You are the one
who're trying to bribe him.

298
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,380
To be fair,

299
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,580
let him speak the truth.

300
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,340
Little Pi,

301
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,940
did Mum lose you

302
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,900
or did Dad buy you off?

303
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,220
What Dad?

304
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,740
Uncle Liu.

305
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,660
Where are you going?

306
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,220
Go home and get dressed

307
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,100
for work.

308
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,860
100 ways to spoil your wife.

309
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,980
First,

310
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,220
your wife is always

311
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,130
the most beautiful.

312
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,610
Give your wife a little
surprises from time to time.

313
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,540
Remember your wife's favourite food,

314
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,420
clothes design and colour.

315
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,340
Lu Fen Jin.

316
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,140
Yes, Your Highness.

317
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,740
Why did you write this?

318
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,660
Darling, you have no idea

319
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,140
how pitiful

320
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,060
Liu is.

321
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
So I have decided

322
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,300
So I have decided to
pass on all my experience

323
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,060
to him.

324
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,460
Yes.

325
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,580
I know you mean well.

326
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,300
But I think

327
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,220
we'd better not add to the mess.

328
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,780
Young people

329
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,700
have their own thoughts

330
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,460
have their own way of
dealing with problems.

331
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,180
So,

332
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,980
let's leave everything to fate.

333
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,580
Can somebody tell me
what is love all about?

334
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,300
It's not accurate.

335
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,220
Is it sentimental or lamenting?

336
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,660
Lamenting.

337
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,690
Lu Fan Fan.

338
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,530
Have you

339
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,020
finished your homework?

340
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
Have you cleaned the table?

341
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,220
Have you helped me sweep the floor?

342
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,970
Then, what are you doing here?

343
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,300
Quickly go and finish it.

344
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,540
Lu Fen Jin.

345
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,660
Come here!

346
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,130
Yeah,

347
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,860
let's leave everything to fate.

348
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,180
What is the point of you doing this?

349
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,620
Just let him go.

350
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,540
They didn't do anything to hurt us.

351
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,370
Let him go?

352
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,260
Did they treat me as their own child?

353
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,020
Don't forget.

354
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,810
We are the same person.

355
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
I am the only one
who is the closest to you.

356
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,420
If it's not for your reluctance,

357
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,940
I would have sent him to
meet Yu Li Qing long ago.

358
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,220
Don't mention my mum!

359
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,540
Do you know what you're doing?

360
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,240
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

361
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,820
Have a seat first,

362
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,660
I'll have it done in a minute.

363
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,500
Alright,

364
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,610
let's talk about you now.

365
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,020
Doctor,

366
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,380
I want to ask you something.

367
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,980
If you could go back in time,

368
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,220
which period would you like to go back to?

369
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,370
Did you make any mistakes?

370
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,220
Some mistakes should not be erased.

371
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,900
There is no need to go back in time.

372
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:36,740
You…

373
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,700
You don't have to wonder why I'm here.

374
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,500
It's not important.

375
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,740
What matters is

376
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,500
why you have become like this.

377
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,460
What's wrong with being like this now?

378
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,980
Money.

379
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,340
Respect.

380
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,580
Social status.

381
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,900
I have everything I want.

382
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,860
The most important thing is that

383
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,380
I won't be bullied by others anymore.

384
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,980
Now,

385
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,740
it's just me bullying others.

386
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,220
I know you have suffered a lot

387
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,620
over the years.

388
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,020
None of this matters.

389
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,700
Have you ever thought about

390
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
what kind of person
Dad would like us to be?

391
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,260
He has been gone for so long.

392
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,770
Why did you mention him?

393
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,020
Coward.

394
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,420
You are still a coward.

395
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,580
Chicken-hearted.

396
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,820
Timid.

397
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,700
Easy to bully.

398
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,580
Yes.

399
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,420
I'm chicken-heated,

400
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,860
timid,

401
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,300
easy to bully.

402
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,180
But I just want a home sweet home.

403
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,130
I promised Dad

404
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,420
I would be a successful person,

405
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,980
not someone as

406
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,380
vile,

407
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,700
gloomy,

408
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,740
psycho

409
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,700
and perverted as you are!

410
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,580
Shut up!
