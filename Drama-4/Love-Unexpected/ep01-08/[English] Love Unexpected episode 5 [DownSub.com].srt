But,

163
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,150
do you really believe that
I'm from the future?

164
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,870
Time travel is not impossible.

165
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,430
When the space is warped
by the force of gravity,

166
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,430
time will also fly pass at different speed

167
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,630
due to the huge gravitational force.

168
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,910
When the black hole
and white hole are connected,

169
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,550
if the entrance to the black hole
and white hole

170
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,390
overlaps within a small range

171
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,590
and you jump through it,

172
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,630
you will find that

173
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,940
you have skipped the passage of time.

174
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,070
This is what we called time shift.

175
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,350
It's so complicated.

176
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,390
I don't understand.

177
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,350

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,590

So,

181
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,310
can you tell me

182
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,790
how to get back to where I came from?

183
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,830
This, I don't know.

184
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,630
In today's science,

185
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,990
only the parallel space theory

186
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,710
supports the time shift phenomenon.

187
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,870
It's just that

188
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,390
these have not been proven.

189
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,230

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,430
Well then,

192
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,990
how does 2024 look like?

193
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,830
Much more fun than now.

194
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,300
There are VR games,

195
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,670
livestream videos,

196
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,110
artificial intelligence
and driverless cars.

197
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,110
Even software can identify its owner

198
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,310
based on just the iris.

199
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,670
Car theft will never happen.

200
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,070
That convenient?

201
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,470
But

202
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,990
there are pros and cons.

203
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,740
If your personal information is stolen,

204
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,420
right on the next day,

205
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,350
your bank card,

206
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,070
ID card,

207
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,230
personal privacy,

208
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,710
will all be made public,

209
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,110
and you'll make the headlines.

210
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,470
Your 2024

211
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,270
is hard to imagine.

212
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,430
Do you not believe me?

213
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,870
No, no.

214
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,030
It's just that the world you mentioned
is too perfect.

215
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,070
I'm looking forward to it.

216
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,550
So,

217
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,870
if I can find a way back,

218
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,990
I will definitely look for the future you

219
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,230
in 2024,

220
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,630
and then prove it to you.

221
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,070
It's a promise.

222
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,030
It's a promise.

223
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,150
Oh, by the way,

224
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,030
this thing here,

225
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,110
is it yours?

226
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,870
Why do you have it?

227
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,510
I've been looking for it for a long time.

228
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,190
I found it at the basketball court
the other day.

229
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,110
Now

230
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,350
it's returned to its owner.

231
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,110
Thank you.

232
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,610
[An Ren Hospital
Hospital Payment]

233
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,190
It's me.

234
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,310
Don't scream!

235
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,710
What are you doing here?

236
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,830
This is the hospital.

237
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,230
Have you paid all the hospital bills?

238
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,430
Is there any more?

239
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,750
I have no money.

240
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,670
I am completely broke now.

241
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,110
Show it to me.

242
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,830
Isn't this money?

243
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,310
I borrowed this.

244
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,710
This is for mom's medical bills.

245
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,270
Go and borrow more.

246
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,430
I need it for emergency.

247
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,230
I've promised him that

248
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,030
these will be used
to buy supplements for mom.

249
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,510
My lovely daughter.

250
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,350
Not bad.

251
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,550
Have you found another boyfriend?

252
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,990
He treats you well.

253
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,670
He even gives you money for supplements.

254
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,790
Who will like someone like me?

255
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,190
Why doesn't he like you?

256
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,070
My daughter is so pretty.

257
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,310
He has a girlfriend

258
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,190
and I don't want to
ruin their relationship.

259
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,590
My lovely daughter.

260
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,630
Tell me,

261
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,470
is he rich?

262
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,270
No.

263
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,430
And I will never
borrow money from him again.

264
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,510
Stop lying.

265
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,950
I watched you grow up.

266
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,110
Let me tell you,

267
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,670
as long as he is rich,

268
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,830
you have to get him!

269
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,750
As for that girlfriend,

270
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,390
leave her to me.

271
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,910
It won't be that easy.

272
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,950
Looks colorful, aromatic and flavorful.

273
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,310
Of course.

274
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,790
I am a famous top notch nutritionist.

275
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,030
Can you cook every day from now on?

276
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,310
What's so hard about cooking?

277
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,790
I'm talking about every day.

278
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,150
Make sure there is no leftover today.

279
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:06,830
Finished everything.

280
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,350
Okay!

281
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,870
Bon appetit!

282
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,630
It's delicious!

283
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,750
It's really good!

284
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,870
Liu Ruo Chen.

285
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,030
Are you drunk?

286
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,350
I'm just

287
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,620
a little sleepy.

288
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,670
Let me take a nap.

289
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,990
Liu Ruo Chen.

290
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,710
Liu Ruo Chen.

291
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,750
You

292
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,020
Walk properly.

293
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,150
Don't drink so much if you can't drink.

294
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,710
Such a light drinker.

295
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,260
Liu Ruo Chen!

296
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,150
You liar!

297
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,030
You're just pretending to be drunk.

298
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,830
No, I am really drunk.

299
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,390
Continue to be drunk then.

300
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,430
Fan Fan.

301
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,190
I'm really drunk.

302
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,310
[I wanted to confess to her
by pretending to be drunk.]

303
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,630
[Such a failure.]

304
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,130
[2024]

305
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,109
[This world here,]

306
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,990
[is this really the world I exist in?]

307
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,780
[What happened when I was in a coma?]

308
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,910
You are really here.

309
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,069
Why are you here?

310
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,750
Isn't there a meteor shower today?

311
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,270
Auntie told me,

312
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,470
you're here waiting for shooting stars.

313
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,310
There's shooting stars!

314
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,670
Quick, make a wish.

315
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,790
You're done? That's fast.

316
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,950
Shooting stars can't realise my wish.

317
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,150
What do you mean?

318
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,070
I just hope

319
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,190
the wish you just made has me in it.

320
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,900
What a shame,

321
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,510
every time there's shooting stars,

322
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,430
it doesn't last long.

323
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,510
There's not enough time for more wishes.

324
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,430
Do you want to see shooting stars again?

325
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,270
Do you think shooting stars belong to you

326
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,710
and that you get to see it
whenever you want?

327
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,950
You are not Doraemon.

328
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,550
Who knows?

329
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,710
Close your eyes.

330
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,430
Doraemon and me

331
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,470
will make your dream shine.

332
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,990
Quick, make a wish.

333
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,830
I hope

334
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,350
the people around me

335
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,230
will be safe,

337
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,350
and happy forever.

338
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,430
It's a bit different from shooting stars,

339
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,870
but it's still beautiful, isn't it?

340
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,190
It's really beautiful.

341
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,070
Thank you.

342
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,030
Thank you for today.

343
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,870
Don't mention it.

344
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,110
How did this happen?

345
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,270
Don't worry.

346
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,510
Don't be afraid.

347
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,550
I'll call the police right away.

348
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,390
Did I offend anyone?

349
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,150
[He's now targeting Fan Fan.]

350
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,750
Don't overthink.

351
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,950
Let the police handle it.

352
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,430
You can't stay here tonight.

353
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,510
Come to my place.

354
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,590
For your safety,

355
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,870
not just tonight.

356
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,710
If you nothing important to do these days,

357
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,510
stay at my place and don't go anywhere.

358
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,420
But

359
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,350
At your place?

360
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,550
Won't it be inconvenient?

361
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,190
Safety is most important.

362
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,710
I want to lodge a police report.

363
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,010

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,190
Come here.

366
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,750
When will you pay up?

367
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,910
In four days.

368
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:54,990
When?

369
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,510
Four days.

370
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,110
Say it again!

371
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,030
Four days!

372
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,190
It's broken!

373
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,950
Three days, right?

374
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,990
Three days!

375
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,260
Right?

376
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,390
It's broken!

377
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,470
Three days.

378
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,190
Brother!

379
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,550
I'll pay up in three days for sure!

Three days!

381
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,990
I'll pay up in three days for sure!

382
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,350
Don't hit me!

383
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,990
Brother Feng.

384
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,470
Don't hit me!

385
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,190
Brother Feng.

386
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,670
It's me.

387
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,830
Get up.

388
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,550
Get up.

389
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,070
You scared me!

390
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,670
Brother Feng.

391
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,870
I saw debt collectors
at the door just now.

392
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,350
This time they are for real.

393
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,630
I can see that.

394
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,590
Alright, alright.

395
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,220
Xiao Hu.

396
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,150
I want to ask you something.

397
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,430
What's the fastest way possible

398
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,350
to make a woman

399
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,630
leave a man?

400
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,790
Brother Feng.

401
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,430
Are you preparing for a funeral?

402
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,950
What nonsense.

403
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,350
I have a way to get money.

404
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,720
[Stay tuned for the post-credit scene!]

405
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,400
♫ A little bit caught in ♫

406
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,680
♫ A little about jokes ♫

407
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,340
♫ Life seems to be a strange riddle ♫

408
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,540
♫ I don't know who to tell the story ♫

409
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:22,710
♫ And I don't know why
you just disappeared suddenly ♫

410
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:30,060
♫ Better slow it down ♫

411
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:38,880
♫ Or else my heart
will be crushed to pieces ♫

412
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,390
What good food are you making?

413
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:47,190
♫ Because losing you ♫

414
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,870
Didn't I say yesterday that
good-hearted people will be rewarded?

415
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,830
Today,

416
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,510
someone is making you breakfast.

417
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,830
By the way,

418
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,390
I've lent my money to Zhu Yi Xiao,

419
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:56,600
♫ Is just too unbearable ♫

420
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,830
what to do now that
I don't have money for food?

421
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,910
For the sake of your righteous,

422
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,390
I'll take care of your daily meals
from now on.

423
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,630
Can you add some red beans?

424
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,400
♫ You said I am a fool who is not loved ♫

425
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,590
No one add red beans to omelette rice.

426
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,720
♫ Because I just can't forget you ♫

427
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,670
Don't cause trouble.

428
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,870
Go and get yourself clean.

429
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,950
♫ And I can't forgive you
for what you did ♫

430
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,260
♫ You left me alone in emptiness ♫

431
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,090
♫ In a mysterious room without sunlight ♫

432
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,960
♫ Go tell the world
that I still love you ♫

433
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,570
♫ I can't get you out of my mind ♫

434
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,010
♫ But you never will find me ♫

435
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:35,240
♫ Craving the affection from you ♫

436
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,030
Bon appetit.

437
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,070
Omelette rice.

438
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,470
What is it?

439
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,230
Nothing.

440
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,550
This is the tastiest
and sweetest omelette rice

441
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,710
I've had in my life.
