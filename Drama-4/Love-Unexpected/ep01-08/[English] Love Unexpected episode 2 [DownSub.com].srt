Hello?

572
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,150
[Hello, Boss.]

573
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,750
[I would like to place an order.]

574
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,110
Please hold on.

575
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,790
[I want a set of lemon chicken feet.]

576
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,310
Lemon chicken feet.

577
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,190
[A set of crispy rice cakes,]

578
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,070
[a set of steamed prawns
with minced garlic,]

579
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,270
[and a cup of]

580
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,230
[your signature milk tea.]

581
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,590
Signature milk tea?

582
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,270
We don't have that.

583
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,060
I'm sorry.

584
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,070
[That's impossible.]

585
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,110
[I just ordered that yesterday.]

586
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,710
[Please send the food to me
as soon as possible.]

587
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,710
Mum.

588
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,030
What's the matter?

589
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,590
Do we serve signature milk tea here?

590
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,790
We do.

591
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,030
The drink was always available.

592
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,750
Since when did we serve that?

593
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,270
Did you forget?

594
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,270
A long time ago,

595
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,350
there was a young girl
who worked in our restaurant.

596
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,350
She invented it.

597
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,710
You loved it

598
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,790
when you were young.

599
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,790
I remember now.

600
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,190
You can resume your work.

601
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,270
[So, what exactly went wrong?]

602
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,550
[Why is the present world]

603
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,030
[so much different
from what I can remember?]

604
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,790
[Don't tell me]

605
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,590
[that Liu Ruo Chen
was speaking the truth?]

606
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,030
Sorry about that.

607
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,590
Sorry about that.

608
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,350
Lu Fan Fan?

609
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,670
Fancy seeing you here.

610
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,550
Are you here for grocery shopping?

611
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,910
You are?

612
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,070
Don't you

613
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,870
recognise me?

614
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,870
I'm Gao Ru Wen.

615
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,590
Gao Ru...

616
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,150
Sorry.

617
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,230
I was caught in an accident before.

618
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,310
I can't remember everything clearly.

619
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,710
Do we know each other?

620
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,990
That's right.

621
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:33,950
Look.

622
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,430
We've known each other for a long time.

623
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,550
You used to chat with me often.

624
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,910
I'm sorry.

625
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,230
I didn't mean to behave like this.

626
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,260
That's fine.

627
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,070
You should try to chat with the people
you used to chat with

628
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,670
and visit the places you used to frequent.

629
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,100
It might aid you in
recovering your memories.

630
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,670
Your current situation

631
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,750
is just like a frozen PC.

632
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,750
Some errors had occurred.

633
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,830
Everything will be fine

634
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,790
when the system is restored.

635
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,830
I believe

636
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,710
that I will surely get better
after some time.

637
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,110
This is my name card.

638
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,910
[Gao Ru Wen]

639
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,830
Keep it.

640
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,950
It might be of use to you in the future.

641
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,230
Thank you.

642
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,950
Gao Ru Wen?

643
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,550
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

644
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,350
♫ I never believed in ♫

645
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,240
♫ So-called obstacles ♫

646
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,570
♫ I only believed ♫

647
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,960
♫ That you loved me ♫

648
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,890
♫ It's you ♫

649
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,340
♫ Who had shown me a sky full of love ♫

650
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,990
Mum,

651
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,590
I just received the university's
letter of acceptance.

652
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,560
♫ Every bit ♫

653
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,340
When I was young,

654
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,640
♫ Makes me happy ♫

655
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,190
you kept saying that I didn't study hard.

656
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,620
♫ Because I have met you ♫

657
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,550
I was an elite student

658
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,070
in high school, you know?

659
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,260
♫ From that day onwards ♫

660
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,920
♫ I will become careful ♫

661
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,310
I don't need to worry about finding a job.

662
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,430
Now, I can support the family too.

663
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,530
♫ Not to wake you up in the morning ♫

664
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,230
Dad doesn't need

665
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,590
to be the sole breadwinner
of the family now.

666
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,140
♫ When you're still asleep ♫

667
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,270
Just rest well.

668
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,750
You don't need to worry about us.

669
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,670
♫ In my heart ♫

670
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,090
♫ You're the stars
that are brighter than the sun ♫

671

♫ Bringing me unforgettable memories ♫

672

♫ From that day onwards ♫

673
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,830
Mom,

674
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,190
♫ As long as there are traces of you ♫

675
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,470
the house is doing fine.

676
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,260
♫ They can never be replaced ♫

677
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,710
But I truly miss you.

678
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,200
♫ Never parting with me ♫
