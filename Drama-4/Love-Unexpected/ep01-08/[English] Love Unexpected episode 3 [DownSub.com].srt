You've mistaken him.

199
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,190
Excuse me.

201
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,510
I saw it first.

202
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,110
Do you like Qian Ming Yue?

203
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,790
Yes.

204
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,710
I've liked him since his debut.

205

It's his new album.

206
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,220
And then?

207
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,390
I saw it first.

208

Hurry up. Don't waste our time.

230
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,870
it's wrong to bully your classmate?

231
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,110
Who are you?

232
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,630
You bully others at such a young age.

233
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,990
It's not good when you grow up.

234

Old lady.

235
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,350
It's none of your business.

You know what we're going to do.

262
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,990
It costs at least 70 or 80.

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,030
Do you have money?

264
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,510
No.

let's rush out.

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,590
Are we not going to pay?

270
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,950
It's not good.

271
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,910
Why not?

272

Is there any problem with the food today?

277
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,950
So, he didn't come today.

278
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,310
He stood us up all the time.

279
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,420
Run!

280
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,110
Hey.

281
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,950
You didn't pay and yet hit my wife.

282

I have no money.

283

284

289

tell me about your conditions.

383
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,430
I'll adjust it for you accordingly.

384
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,150
I don't have

385
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,030
an eating disorder.

386
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,190
Well.

387
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,590
Please follow me.

388
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,750
Miss Lu.

389
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,270
Please have a rest here.

390
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,310
Help yourself.

391
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,550
Puppy.

392
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,790
Why are you here?

393
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,310
Are you hungry?

394
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,710
It's called Pikachu.

395
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,230
Mr. Liu.

396
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,550
Aren't you going too far?

397
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,820
You fed my food to the dog before.

398
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,790
Yet now,

399
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,590
you asked someone to find me.

400
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,950
What do you want?

401
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,550
I run such a big law firm.

402
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,510
Why would I make such a joke with you?

403
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,270
Look.

404
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,870
This is the picture we took
on the wishing boat in 2012.

405
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,030
I don't know

406
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,470
how you got the picture.

407
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,190
But if you keep on bothering me,

408
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,350
I'll sue you for harassment.

409
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,710
Don't be mad, Fan Fan.

410
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

411
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,990
I just came to deliver meals.

412
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,350
Please enjoy the meal.

413
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,990
Thank you.

415
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,910
Cheer up, Assistant Liu.

416
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,590
The Faculty of Law and Faculty
of Economics are playing basketball.

417
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,390
There are many handsome boys. Come on.

418
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,270
Is it too late to go now?

419
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,990
No. Hurry up.

420
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,990
The Faculty of Law?

421
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,590
Could it be

422
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,550
Liu Ruo Chen playing basketball?

423
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,550
Come on!

424
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,670
Cheer up!

425
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,830
Keep it up, Faculty of Economics!

426
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,430
Go for it!

427
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,790
Block him.

428
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,990
How cool.

429
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,790
Liu Ruo Chen is so cool.

430
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,630
Who is she?

431
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,110
How dare she call Assistant Liu
by his name?

432
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,590
Yes.

433
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,950
Why did she call him so?

434
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,310
Ridiculous.

435
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,870
Run, run.

436
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,230
Block him.

437
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,230
Cheer up!

438
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,390
Watch out for the rebound.

439
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,790
Assistant Liu.

440
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,230
Assistant Liu, drink some water.

441
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,940
Take mine.

442
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,550
Have some water.

443
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,270
I bought it specially for you.

444
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,750
Assistant Liu.

445
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,510
Take mine.

446
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,430
Assistant Liu.

447
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,500
Please have some water.

448
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,110
Assistant Liu.

449
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,510
Gosh.

450
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,430
Why did he drink her water?

451
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,430
Who's that?

452
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,910
Why would he drink her water?

453
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,470
Zhu Yi Xiao was rejected.

454
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,270
That's right.

455
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,390
It doesn't matter
if she's rich and good-looking.

456
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,870
She was still being turned down.

457

[178 Average Benz]

458
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,910
[Hello, Yi Xiao.]

459
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,590
What's the matter?

460
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,860
[I'm outside your college.]

461
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,790
[I want to ask if your class is over.]

462
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,630
Did you come to my college?

463
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,470
[Yes.]

464
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,790
[I'm at the gate.]

465
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,550
Come in then.

466
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,750
I'm at the basketball court.

467
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,110
[Okay.]

468
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,790
Yi Xiao.

469
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,950
Is that your boyfriend?

470
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,830
No.

471
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,150
I haven't agreed yet.

472
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,110
Did you purposely come to see me?

473
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,830
I didn't.

474
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,550
I just happened to pass by.

475
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,590
That was my student.

476
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,620
I didn't ask you about it.

477
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,710
I just think that

478
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,350
it's not good.

479
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,470
Well.

480
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,270
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,550
I didn't mean to...

482
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,630
How about this?

483
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,990
Let me treat you to ice cream

484
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,070

I cut some fruits for you.

493

Come on.

494
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,470

495
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,550
Are you sleepy?

496
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,910
If you're not sleepy,

497
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,180
talk to me.

498
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,350
Is there anything you want to tell me?

499
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,070
Well.

500
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,150
There are many things

501
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,830
I can't remember recently.

502
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,030
For instance,

503
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,670
Mr. Liu said

504
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,710
he's my boyfriend.

505
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,990
But I don't remember him at all.

506
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,550
I also think

507
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,750
Mr. Liu looks familiar.

508
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,750
As you know,

509
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,230
I won't interfere much
in your relationship.

510
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,830
So

511
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,070
if there are any doubts,

512
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,540
you should ask clearly.

513
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,550
Don't avoid it.

514
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:10,950
Okay.

520
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,670
I've put it on.

521
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,830
I thought you wouldn't come to me again.

522
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,110
Don't think too much.

523
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,350
I just want to

524
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,070
talk about

525
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,870
our relationship.

526
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,660
If I mean a lot to you

527
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,670
as you mentioned,

528
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,430
why do I have no impression of you?

529
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,590
You don't remember me at all?

530
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,110
Yes.

531
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,900
But I only remember

532
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,990
that you're Mr. Liu

533
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,310
I've seen on television.

534
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,670
That's all.

535
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,190
Apart from television,

536
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,950
do you have the impression
of other places?

537
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,030
Oh, right.

538
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,830
It's the wishing card
on the wishing boat.

539
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,670
It's our token of love

540
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,430
and my promise to you.

541
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,430
Among all things in the world,

542
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,200
[You're the most special one for me]

543
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,150
you're the most special one for me.

544
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,030
Yes.

545
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,110
It's the wish we made together.

546
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:00,990
How?

547
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,590
Did you recall it?

548
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,230
I have no idea.

549
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,590
And

550
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,430
it's not like my style.

551
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,110
Twelve years.

552
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,070
I've been waiting for this and
those words for twelve years.

553
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,310
How could you even forget it?

554
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,750
It was our promise.

555
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,790
Maybe

556
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,110
it's not me

557
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,950
who made the promise.

558
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,750
I shouldn't come here.

559
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,510
Mr. Liu.

560
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,190
Take it back.

00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,550
[is just a piece of aimless music.]

574
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,910
[They hopped and spoke]

575
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,830
[the voice of my heart]

576
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,830
[as if they were alive.]

577
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,100
♫ I'm looking forward ♫

578
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,200
♫ To our Wednesday date♫

579
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,030
[Xiao Yue.]

580
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,390
[My dear sister.]

581
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,180
♫ Catching ♫

582
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,310
[It's been ten years.]

583
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,030
[I've been looking for you.]

584
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,370
♫ The last movie together with you ♫

585
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,430
[But I couldn't find you.]

586
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,710
♫ I'm afraid that I'm overthinking it ♫

587
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,270
[Where exactly are you?]

588
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,150
[How are you doing?]

589
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,090
♫ I'm hesitating about my last move ♫

590
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,290
♫ Remembering your name ♫

591
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,470
Xiao Yue.

592
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,510
Let me play a song for you.

593
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,390
Okay.

594
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,210
♫ Catching ♫

595
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,570
♫ The last movie together with you ♫

596
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,449
♫ I'm afraid that I'm overthinking it ♫

597
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,210
♫ I'm hesitating about my last move ♫

598
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,449
♫ Remembering your name ♫

599
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,350
♫ The ending of the story was light ♫

600
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,429
[I wish I could see you again.]

601
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,429
♫ I have zero luck today ♫

602
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,870
[I wish we could]

603
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,030
[still be as simple]

604
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,090
♫ The weather forecast last night
foresaw a sunny morning ♫

605
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,670
[and happy]

606
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,310
[as we were young.]

607
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,210
♫ But it's drizzling within my heart ♫

608
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,940
♫ I cannot resonate with you ♫

609
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,600
♫ I heard your voice all of a sudden ♫

610
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,130
♫ Why do you sound
as cold as a cloudy day? ♫

611
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,320
♫ I have the same longing ♫

612
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,469
[I wish I could meet you again]

613
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,639
♫ For you today ♫

614
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,909
[and play a wonderful melody.]
