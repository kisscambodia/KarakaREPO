00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,470
In the future,

6
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,950
you shouldn't be this careless.

7
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,150
Thanks.

8
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,910
I'll make a move first.

9
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,350
Are you going to return home?

10
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,910
Since I'm already here,

11
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,310
I might as well walk around.

12
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,750
I'll return home by myself later.

13
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,470
You don't need to care about me.

14
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,830
Qin Yang!

15
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,670

16
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,270
Let's head inside for now!

17
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:09,990
Let's hide first!

18
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,580
What's the matter?

19
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,150
Hide!

20
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,270
That Qin Yang,

21
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,950
he actually barged into my lab

22
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,950
instead of studying law.

23
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,430
If I catch you,

24
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,910
I'll teach you a lesson.

25
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,390
What did you do?

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,510
I just did

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,510
a Helmholtz coil experiment in the lab.

28
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,190
As long as the magnetic field response

29
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,590
and the energy of an area
are strong enough,

30
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,500
we can transport a person
from one timeline

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,790
to another timeline.

32
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,950
By then,

33
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,590
we can prove that you did come from 2024.

34
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,230
It sounds complicated.

35
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,190
But,

36
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,670
isn't my existence

37
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,270
the best proof of them all?

38
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,990
Are you willing to tell me about

39
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,710
the time-travelling process
you had undergone?

40
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,950
I can analyse it for you.

41
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,510
I remember now.

42
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,950
On that day,

43
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,310
the entire city had a blackout.

44
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,950
After that,

45
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,990
I saw a streak of light
on the door handle.

46
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,500
Just when I was about to touch it,

47
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,510
that was when I realised
I was transported here.

48
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,750
Was that information useful?

49
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,350
A blackout?

50
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,670
A streak of light?

51
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,030
I think it was caused by a magnetic field.

52
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,150
Maybe it's a geomagnetic storm.

53
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,190
caused by the mutated sunspots.

54
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,829
Don't tell me it's due to
the Fermi Bubbles?

55
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,430
That's right.

56
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,950
It's the Fermi Bubbles.

57
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,310
They showed it on TV during that day.

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,510
Qin Yang,

59
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,950
you're really amazing.

60
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,070
So, it was what I expected.

61
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,750
I've done my investigation.

62
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,230
In August 2012,

63
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,270
the Bermuda Triangle,

64
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,070
the Crop Circles,

65
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,110
all of those phenomena

66
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,190
proved that Earth's magnetic field
was experiencing turbulence.

67
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,790
The turbulence resonated

68
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,830
with the magnetic field line
in your timeline.

69
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,070
That's how you were able to time-travelled

70
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,260
from 2024 to 2012.

71
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,230
So, does that mean

72
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,230
if the Fermi Bubbles appear again,

73
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,190
I might have a chance
to return to my timeline?

74
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,270
I guess so.

75
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,350
I can finally go back!

76
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,470
Go back?

77
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:19,950
Qin Yang,

78
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,910
is this experiment

79
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,670
very difficult?

80
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,510
It'll be fine.

81
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,350
Don't worry.

82
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,550
Just leave the experiment to me.

83
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,270
By the way,

84
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,990
I remember that
there was a book in the library

85
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,470
that talked about the
time-space continuum.

86
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,270
Maybe

87
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,310
it might be useful to us.

88
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,790
I remember that book was in Zone G.

89
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,230
It should be nearby.

90
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,830
Why can't I find it?

91
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,590
What's the name of the book?

92
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,030
"Letters to Lily".

93
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,510
Let's look for it together.

94
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,670

I'm late for the class.

[Do you understand?]

190
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,950
[How does he know]

191
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,510
[about my every move?]

192
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,390
[He even took a picture
of me and Fan Fan.]

193
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,870
[Could it be that he had installed
hidden cameras in the house?]

194
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,510
[Did he install them
right beside the house?]

195
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,950
The show will begin soon.

196
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,870
Here.

197
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,790
The weather has turned cold.

198
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,790
You should cover yourself.

199
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,950
Thank you, Mum.

200
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,830
You too.

201
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,430
Have you been feeling better

202
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,030
these few days?

203
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,270
I feel much better.

204
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,830
It's just

205
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,110
that some things

206
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,230
and some people

207
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,870
feel muddy

208
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,750
to me.

209
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,070
I cannot remember them.

210
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,980
Were you referring

211
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,550
to Lawyer Liu?

212
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,270
He told me a lot of things.

213
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,670
It...

214
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,230
It felt unfamiliar,

215
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,630
but it didn't seem fake.

216
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,710
It's fine.

217
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,190
Take your time.

218
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,590
Don't stress yourself out.

219
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,630
Everything will get better.

220
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:44,990
Mum,

221
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,950
so...

222
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,590
What if, one day,

223
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,350
I forgot

224
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,030
the way home?

225
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,430
What should I do?

226
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,710
Silly child,

227
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,630
no matter where you are,

228
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,350
I'll be able to find you.

229
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,030
It's because our hearts

230
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,830
are interconnected.

231
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,390
Hello, Mr. Qin.

232
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:25,950
Chen,

233
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,230
I found Gao Ru Wen.

234
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,430
What should we do now?

235
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,990
We don't have concrete evidence
against his crime.

236
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,830
We can't do anything to him for now.

237
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,310
But you can't just let him

238
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,430
spy on you all the time.

239
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,750
Moreover, there's Fan Fan.

240
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,350
What if he tries to harm Fan Fan?

241
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,990
Let's go and meet him then.

242
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,830
Chen,

243
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,390
do we need to call the cops in advance?

244
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,590
What's the room number?

245
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,390
1801.

246
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,750
[Liu Ruo Chen,]

247
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,550
[you're one step too late.]

248
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,350
Chen,

249
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,350
come and take a look.

250
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,910
[Lu Fan Fan, 24 years old, nutritionist]

251
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,950
Gao Ru Wen is too much.

252
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,110
And,

253
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,350
if he does intend to harm Fan Fan...

254
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,870
I think we should notify
Fan Fan about this.

255
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,750
That way, she'll be able to
keep her guard up against him.

256
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,630
Let's go.

257
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,100
[2012]

258
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,390
I remember

259
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,590
that it's nearby.

260
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,870
Why can't I find it?

261
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,910
Strange.

262
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,230
I remembered that it was here.

263
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,510
This is the place!

264
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,070
Mister!

265
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,710
I want this!

266
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:53,990
That's 50 cents.

267
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,110
Uncle Xiang!

268
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,950
Do I know you?

269
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,510
Of course.

270
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,790
I used to frequent this shop.

271
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,030
But,

272
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,190
back then,

273
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,310
your tummy

274
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,550
wasn't this big.

275
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,190
Let me foot the bill.

276
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:11,829
Brother Feng,

277
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,670
she's inside.

278
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,589
Do we strike now?

279
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,420
Let's wait a little longer.

280
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,940
There are too many people around her.

281
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,190
Once someone calls the cops,

282
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,550
we'll be sent to the police station.

283
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,950
Brother Feng,

284
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,550
I think we should quit.

285
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,470
We can think of something else
to gather the money.

286
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,910
It has already come to this.

287
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,710
If you plan on quitting right now,

288
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,070
I'll show you no mercy.

289
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,670
Brother Feng,

290
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,470
there are people everywhere.

291
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,030
We don't have a chance to strike.

292
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,150
We have to wait for our opportunity.

293
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,030
If we kidnap her successfully,

294
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,870
we'll be able to enjoy a luxurious life.

295
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,870
Alright then.

296
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,670
Brother Feng,

297
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,470
I'll follow your instruction.

298
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,830
But Brother Feng,

299
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,070
let me tell you this first.

300
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,190
If something goes awry,

301
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,670
I'll escape first.

302
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,220
Save your breath.

303
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,190
Just wait.

304
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,910
Let's wait.

305
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,070
Lu Fen Jin,

306
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,270
look at how cloudy it is out here.

307
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,070
It's almost raining,
yet you had to drag me out

308
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,230
to play the swing.

309
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,750
Dear,

310
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,020
you don't understand.

311
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,110
It's only romantic during rainy days.

312
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,900
♫ The most romantic thing
I could think of ♫

313
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,100
♫ Is to grow old together with you ♫

314
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,910
♫ Together ♫

315
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,790
Dear,

316
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,950
are you okay?

317
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,070
My heart feels uncomfortable.

318
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,110
Are you okay?

319
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,830
I'm fine.

320
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,670
I'm fine.

321
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,310
You scared me.

322
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,710
Fan Fan didn't bring an umbrella with her.

323
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:06,790
Yeah.

324
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,950
I think her class should be over by now.

325
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,710
Look!

326
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,030
I told you it was going to rain!

327
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,110
Dear, sit tight.

328
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,990
Here's our romantic moment.

329
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,470
Isn't it romantic?

330
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,070
Doesn't it feel great?

331
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,990
Yeah, it's romantic.

332
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,390
You can bask in the
romantic moment yourself.

333
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,310
I'll make a move first.

334
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:21,990
Wait for me!

335
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:22,630
Wait for me!

336
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,030
Big Sister?

337
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,110
Why are you here?

338
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,990
I thought you were
supposed to be on a trip?

339
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,990
I...

340
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,630
I just came back.

341
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,420
Is that so?

342
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,670
So,

343
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,070
where did you go on your trip?

344
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,550
Did you take pictures of them?

345
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,070
Did you buy any gifts for me?

346
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,790
Why didn't you return to the restaurant
since you're back?

347
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,270
I...

348
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,910
I was just about to
return to the restaurant.

349
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,150
And I bumped into you here.

350
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,230
Seems like we're growing
distant from each other.

351
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,590
You've started to hide things from me now.

352
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,630
I was wrong.

353
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,590
This...

354
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,750
I was planning to give this to you.

355
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,430
Don't try to shift the topic.

356
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,790
So,

357
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,670
where did you go?

358
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,390
Something happened.

359
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,470
Now, I'm staying

360
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,510
with Big Brother temporarily.

361
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,830
Are you two in a relationship?

362
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,390
No!

363
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,350
Actually,

364
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,630
I do hope for you two
to be in a relationship.

365
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,430
Why?

366
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,750
Because

367
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,150
Big Brother is a nice person.

368
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,590
He's nice to you.

369
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,230
He's nice to us.

370
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,710
I think it's most important

371
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,550
for a family to get along with each other.

372
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,870
I think

373
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,950
he can be part of our family.

374
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,590
I give you my permission
to be in a relationship with him.

375
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,990
Who needs your permission?

376
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,430
You're so mischievous.

377
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,870
When it comes to a relationship,

378
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,430
it's only meaningful

379
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,350
when both sides are contributing
to the relationship.

380
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,350
Let's go.

381
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,030
It's raining?

382
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,750
Brother Feng, she's out.

383
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,060
Both of them are girls?

384
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,350
Kidnap both of them.

385
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:08,910
Come.

386
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,230
Follow me!

387
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,830
Follow them!

388
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,510
Okay.

389
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:14,990
Follow them

390
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,310
What are you doing?

391
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,900
Get inside!

392
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,230
Get inside!

393
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,070
Boss,

394
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,870
I've tied them up.

395
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,510
[This weekend, we need a car model]

396
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,790
[to work in the convention centre.]

397
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,550
[1,000 yuan for two days of work.]

398
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,150
[Do you want the job?]

399
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,860
[I'll take up the offer!]

400
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,170
[Zhu Guo Feng]

401
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:15,870
Hello?

402
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,710
Hello?

403
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,310
My daughter,

404
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,710
send the guy's phone number to me.

405
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,430
Why do you need his number?

406
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,950
I kidnapped the girl.

407
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,380
Now, I'm going to call that guy

408
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,310
and ask him for a ransom.

409
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,190
What did you say?

410
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,150
Listen!

411
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,430
You better don't try anything funny!

412
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,910
I'm doing this for your sake.

413
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,910
If you can't get his heart,

414
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,230
at least you need to get his money.

415
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,870
This is illegal!

416
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,230
Boss!

417
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,980
This place is great.

418
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,430
[It's remote and spacious.]

419
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,750
[Even the loan sharks can't find us here.]

420
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,870
Keep it down, won't you?

421
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,750
Alright.

422
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,270
Remember to send me his number.

423
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,190
I'll be waiting.

424
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,710
[How did it end up like this?]

425
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,990
[What should I do?]

426
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,910
[Should I call the cops?]

427
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,470
[No.]

428
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,590
[Mum will blame me if I do so.]

429
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,030
[But, if I don't call the cops,]

430
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,150
[what should I do
if something bad happens?]

431
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,160
[Zhu Guo Feng]

432
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,550
[Hurry and send me his number.]

433
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,180
[I was just saying.]

434
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,270
[Why did you kidnap Lu Fan Fan?]

435
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,950
Zhu Guo Feng!

436
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,550
What exactly are you up to?

437
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,710
Big Sister!

438
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,190
It's fine. I'm here with you.

439
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,510
Big Sister!

440
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,190
Give me Liu Ruo Chen's contact number.

441
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,710
Big Sister!

442
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,710
I don't have it.

443
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,830
Big Sister, I'm scared!

444
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,670
Big Sister!

445
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,990
Stop crying!

446
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,310
What exactly are you up to?

447
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,790
Find her phone.

448
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,220
What are you trying to do?

449
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,750
What are you trying to do?

450
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,150
Brother Feng.

451
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,470
[Lu Fan Fan]

452
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,990
Hello?

453
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,230
Lu Fan Fan is in our hands.

454
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,190
Prepare 500,000 yuan immediately.

455
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,030
[If not, you won't get to see her again.]

456
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,590
Who are you?

457
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,950
That doesn't matter.

458
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,590
Just prepare the ransom immediately.

459
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,430
What's wrong?

460
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,510
I can prepare the ransom for you,

461
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,710
but let me listen to her voice first.

462
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,790
Speak.

463
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,390
Speak!

464
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,590
Brother Ruo Chen!
Please save me and Big Sister!

465
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,150
[Hello?]

466
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,310
[Did you hear them?]

467
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,070
Remember,

468
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,990
place the money into the garbage bin

469
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,070
[in Qinglong Street within an hour.]

470
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,990
Do not call the cops.

471
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,910
Remember that.

472
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,190
What's the matter?

473
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,310
Fan Fan is in trouble.

474
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,580
Ruo Chen!

475
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,350
What exactly is going on?

476
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,190
Liu Ruo Chen!

477
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,990
We can talk when I'm back!

478
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,950
It's regarding Lu Fan Fan!

479
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,830
What else do you know?

480
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,870
My father was the one who kidnapped her.

481
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,310
I truly didn't expect things

482
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,670
to turn out like this.

483
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,230
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,710
This isn't your fault.

485
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,470
Our priority right now is to save Fan Fan.

486
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,030
But most banks are closed at this time.

487
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,230
Where can I gather such a huge sum?

488
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,590
Why don't we

489
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,830
approach my father?

490
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,790
No.

491
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,870
We mustn't let your father about this.

492
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,470
We must avoid implicating them.

493
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,670
But,

494
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,430
where can we gather such a huge sum

495
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,430
within an hour?

496
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,230
And, we have to send the money
to Qinglong Street as well.

497
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,510
Did they tell you guys
to go to Qinglong Street?

498
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:33,860
What's the matter?

499
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,430
When my father called me,

500
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,510
I heard someone saying

501
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,270
that they were in
a remote and spacious place.

502
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,870
He said even the loan sharks
couldn't find them.

503
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,110
I'm sure that place he mentioned
wasn't Qinglong Street.

504
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,110
Remote and spacious?

505
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,430
A factory?

506
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,990
That's right!

507
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,190
My father was in a lot of debts
due to his gambling habit.

508
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,990
He would hide in that factory

509
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,630
whenever the loan sharks
were looking for him.

510
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,790
Even the loan sharks
couldn't find him over there.

511
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,590
If that were the case,

512
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,670
that must be it.

513
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,350
The factory

514
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,710
was where he used to work.

515
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,550
After that, it was abandoned
after it closed down.

516
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,510
I don't care anymore.

517
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,590
Let's head there for now.

518
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,350
Brother Feng,

519
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,350
we're going to receive 500,000 yuan!

520
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,790
We'll strike it rich soon!

521
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,790
Be calm.

522
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:21,830
Be calm.

523
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,470
Be calm.

524
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,230
Sit down.

525
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,310
500,000 yuan?

526
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,750
We'll be fine.

527
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,750
Hello?

528
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,270
[Hello, Sir.]

529
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,910
Have you gathered enough money?

530
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,590
[No.]

531
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,550
What?

532
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,870
[I didn't see them in person.]

533
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,230
I thought he loved you?

534
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,670
Look at me!

535
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,470
He couldn't even prepare such a small sum.

536
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,870
Seems like your life isn't
that important to him!

537
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,950
I told you already!

538
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,830
We're unrelated by any means!

539
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,430
You should release us.

540
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,670
He won't give you the ransom.

541
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,070
Seems like I'm too gentle with you!

542
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,270
Lu!

543
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,430
Big Sister!

544
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,550
What about Yi Xiao?

545
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,430
Should we let her stay in the car?

546
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,350
After all, this is her father
we're talking about.

547
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,750
Release Lu immediately!

548
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,910
Big Brother!

549
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,790
Are you okay?

550
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,750
How did you guys find this place?

551
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,710
Release them!

552
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,950
You want me to release them? Fine!

553
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,870
Where's the ransom?

554
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,630
The ransom is on the car.

555
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,950
Release them first!

556
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,190
Stop wasting our time!

557
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,150
I'll kill her!

558
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,720

[Sometimes, when we
put on a false front for too long,]

566
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,550
[we will forget
how we look like in the first place.]

567
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,190
[Who am I?]

568
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,700
♫ The ending isn't perfect,
the plot is reluctant ♫

569
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,510
[Why am I doing this?]

570
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,670
[Where am I going?]

571
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,670
[Why am I putting on a false front?]

572
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,110
♫ Walking through the four seasons,
hand in hand ♫

573
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,950
[I grabbed hold of the things
I didn't want to let go of,]

574
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,630
♫ Our memories are being replayed ♫

575
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,990
[ignoring the gossips and rumours.]

576
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,470
[I'm living in an illusionary world]

577
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,910
♫ I was lucky ♫

578
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,430
[because I want people
to treat me gently.]

579
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,260
♫ That I was once crazy about you ♫

580
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:06,510
♫ Looking at the stars
in the middle of the night, I smiled ♫

581
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,270
[An illusionary world]

582
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,470
[is meant to be shattered.]

583
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,150
[The unpaid medical bills
on my mother's bed]

584
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,210
♫ As I observe your life in silence ♫

585
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,430
[had woken me up.]

586
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,490
♫ A trip, a workout, a book, and a movie ♫

587
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,750
[I spent the first half of my life]

588
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,350
♫ You're getting better at doing makeup ♫

589
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,390
[in fate's cage.]

590
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,310
[I was dragged along.]

591
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,250
♫ It's a pity that now ♫

592
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,510
[I couldn't escape from it.]

593
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,470
[Now,]

594
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,940
♫ I'm not beside you ♫

595
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,790
[this is the start of my new life.]

596
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,150
♫ Maybe you will smile
more often with me around ♫

597
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,900
♫ I hope you think that it's worth it ♫

598
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,130
♫ Even though you might have
regretted your decision ♫

599
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,790
Zhu Yi Xiao!

600
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,110
♫ If we miss out on each other ♫

601
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,070
[In the time tunnel
towards another realm,]

602
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,060
♫ Please trust that
it's none of our fault ♫

603
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,630
[you might find a version of yourself
who longs for happiness.]

604
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,420
♫ Thank you for loving me once ♫

605
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,320
♫ You made me the happiest person ♫

606
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,150
[And that version of you
is trying her best]

607
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,540
♫ Trying my best to predict the future,
it was me all along ♫

608
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,750
[to head towards]

609
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,870
[a warm]

610
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,780
[and wonderful world.]
