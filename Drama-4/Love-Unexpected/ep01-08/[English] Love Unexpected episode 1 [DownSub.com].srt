190
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,510
What is Pikachu?

191
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,180
Alright.

192
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,110
I will leave.

193
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,510
I will pack up and leave.

194
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,270
Thank you

195
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,430
for the hard work.

196
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,060
I'll get going then.

202
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,630

203
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,230
Mr. Liu.

204
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,030
Liu Ruo Chen.

205
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,990
Did you make an appointment?

206
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,470
I'm the nutritionist
engaged by the office.

207
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,550
You might not have seen me before.

208
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,670
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,950
I can't let you in without an appointment.

210
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,470
But it's something urgent.

211
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,310
Would you kindly

212
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,110
make an exception for me?

213
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,110
No.

214
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,510
Fine, I'll make an appointment now.

215
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,550
Come on the 26th 
of the coming month, at 5 am.

216
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,710
You have 10 minutes to see him.

217
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,510

218
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,430

219
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,590
Well...

220
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,910
He goes home after work, right?

221
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,870
I'll make sure

222
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,620
I catch him.

223
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,230
The couch is over there.

224
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,150
You may wait there.

225
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,190
Why is everyone still here?

226
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,350
That's right.

227
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,710
As you haven't left the office,

228
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,950
so...

229
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,750
Go home now.

230
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,790

231
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,430
It's on me.

232
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,150
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

233
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,510
Go home now.

234
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,590
Join them for supper.

235
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,270
Here, let's go.

236
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,790
I know of a nice hotpot restaurant.

237
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,870
Hurry up!

238
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:02,910
Hello?

239
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,230
Hello, Fan Fan.

240
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,990
Are you done with the client?

241
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,230
I have checked in a presidential suite 
in a hotel.

242
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,270
Let's have a gathering.

243
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,150
No one is allowed to go home sober.

244
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,190
Got it.

245
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,030
Hurry.

246
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,230
It's already 10.42 pm?

247
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:24,990
Where is he?

248
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,150
Everyone has gone home.

249
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,710
How was it?

250
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,390
Was it a success?

251
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,750
From your look,

252
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,910
I guess you have failed.

253
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,710
I made a bet with Xiao Yang

254
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,870
that you would get it done for sure.

255
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,990
I treat you as best friend.

256
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,830
But look at you.

257
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,310
You made a bet

258
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,150
on my job.

259
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,150
Don't be mad.

260
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,150
The client is a handsome guy,

261
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,750
and you have been single
for so many years,

262
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,990
I'm trying to match you two up.

263
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,310
That's the way to a handsome man's heart

264
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,270
is through his stomach.

265
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,470
It's such a good deal.

266
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,710
Many people would die for it.

267
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,950
Good deal?

268
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,110
I have bad luck lately.

269
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,430

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,990
Why are you laughing?

272
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,630
He is such an unethical lawyer.

273
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,470
Even if someone gives him to me for free,

274
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,270
I won't take him.

Hello.

376
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,150
My name is Gao Ru Wen.

377
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,750
Are you

378
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,510
troubled by something?

379
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,510
You may say so.

383
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,700
She kept me company all the time

384
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,380
and she always helped me out.

385
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,390
She sounds like a nice person.

386
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,470
Why are you drinking alone?

387
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,790
My best friend

388
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,070
has gone missing.

389
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,510
I only have one friend.

390
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,950
But she...

391
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,710
She has just gone missing all of a sudden.

392
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,190
Your best friend...

393
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,430
Who is she?

394
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,230
Trust me.

395
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,580

Could she be

406

a rebellious young girl 
who has just run away from home?

407
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,870
Do you really don't know where is this?

408
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,910
Why don't

409
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,190

410
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,510
Where is this?

411
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,630
This is a food street.

412
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,350

Yes, it's 2012.

422
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,910
I think it's wrongly printed.

423
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,310
No, it's right.

427

I don't know her.

I didn't get involved in a car crash.

I want to summon a taxi.

436
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,350
If you want to summon a taxi,

437
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,990
you just have to 
stop one at the mouth of the street.

438
