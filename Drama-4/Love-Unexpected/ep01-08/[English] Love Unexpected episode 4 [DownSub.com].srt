Liu Ruo Chen!

8
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,350
Hello.

9
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,390
How do you

10
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,950
relate to Liu Ruo Chen?

11
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,190
Why do you want to know?

12
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm his first love.

13
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,870
First love?

14
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,509
Isn't that the one who asked

15
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,140
"Mr. Liu,"

16
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,509
"do you want some water?"

17
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,660
Isn't that his first love?

18
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:00,990
That's right.

19
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,310
I'm his student

20
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,510
but that doesn't mean 
he had never pursued me before

21
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,150
Did he buy you the ice-cream?

22
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,190
It's chocolate flavored.

23
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,950
That's my favourite.

24
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,910
What to do?

25
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,190
He thinks about me all the time.

26
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,270
You should tell him that.

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,150
Big sister.

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,150
Can you do me a favour?

29
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,030
In a while,

30
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,190
you'll see who he is really in love with.

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,870
What are you doing?

32
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,230
Let go of me!

33
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,070
Stop it, words will do.

35
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,670

You!

37
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,070
Big sister!

38
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,990
What are you doing?

39
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,670
What happened?

40
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,230
Mr. Liu.

41
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,550
She splashed the water on me.

42
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,829
I didn't do that.

43
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,070
If it's because of what happened
at the basketball court during the day,

44
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,590
I promise I won't do it again.

45
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,230
I purely wished to 
send some water to Mr. Liu.

46
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,750
You don't have to 
do this to me, big sister.

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,190
How could you lie?

48
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:01,910
I...

49
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,670
Missy,

50
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,220
she is my girlfriend.

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,070
If she says no, that means no.

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,829
I trust her.

53
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,550
If you feel mistreated,

54
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,950
here, I have done the same to myself.

55
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,350
Let's go.

56
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,870
Why did you pour water on yourself?

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,150
I was trying to 
get you out of the trouble.

58
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,630
What if I did it?

59
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,270
I trust you.

60
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,150
You won't do that.

61
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,310
Well done.

62
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,550
One of your earrings is missing.

63
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,030
No way!

64
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,150
It's given by your mom.

65
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,950
What should I do now?

66
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,470
Let's go back there and look for it.

[2024]

68
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,430
She hasn't recalled anything yet?

69
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,990
Yes.

70
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,350
I'm literally at my wits' end

71
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
but she still doesn't remember me.

72
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,190
As your best friend,

73
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,670
I'm not sure 
if I should advise you to hang in there

74
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,110
or to move on and live a new life.

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,710
It's been 12 years.

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,750
I don't mind waiting longer.

77
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,030
I have made up my mind.

78
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,110
If she forgets me for real,

79
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,270
at worst, I'll have to
pursue her all over again.

80
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,110
Let the waves come stronger!

81
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,230
Is it a black out 
or a tripped circuit breaker?

Electricity is working 
at other residences.

83
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,510
I must have forgot to pay for electricity.

84
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,270
Is this a top-up card?

85
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,550
Leave it to me.

86
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,790
Why are you here?

87
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,430
Are you following me?

88
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,630
No.

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,510
In the end, we had to fire him

191
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,750
due to his bad performance at work.

192
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,270
Then, he asked me for money.

193
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,470
I gave in because I felt pity for him.

194
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,950
I never thought

195
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,910
he would come to school
and asked for money.

196
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,310
That is too much.

197
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,550
Don't give him money anymore.

198
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,030
He is an acquaintance, after all.

199
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,670
I can't bear to see him become a homeless.

200
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,180
But...

201
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,790
I can tell

202
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,470

If he is causing harm to you,

205
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,900
you had better report to the police.

[Gao Ru Wen, Professor of Psychology, 
University of Haicheng]

385
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,830
Is it true

386
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,630
that hypnosis can bring back memories?

387
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,510
I have tried

388
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,910
all your suggestions

389
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,550
including

390
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,510
recreating the scenes

391
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,030
but none of them worked.

392
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,190
It works.

393
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,830
Hypnosis allows direct access 
to the subconscious mind.

394
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,670
It helps to bring back

395
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,390
the memories that you lost
due to some reasons.

396
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,020
As we do not know of the reasons,

397
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,510
thus, during the treatment,

398
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,990
you may see incomplete images.

399
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,790
You just have to tell me what you see.

400
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,830
Are you ready?

401
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,550
Let's begin.

402
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,390
Now, imagine

403
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,790
seeing blue sky 
and white clouds before you.

404
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,910
You are walking along the beach.

405
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,830
The breeze is gently blowing at your face.

406
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,110
And you can hear the waves.

407
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,950
It's okay.

408
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,470
It was just a dream.

What did you see?

411
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,590
It's pitch dark.

412
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,790
A man

413
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,190
was calling my name.

415
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,550
Do you know what does that mean?

416
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,510
Have you seen his face?

417
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,430
I can't remember

418
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,590
what happened next.

419

Professor Gao,

420
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,110
why don't

421
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,990
you hypnotise me again?

422
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,710
You just woke up.

423
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,070
Your mental state is a mess.

424
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,070
We can't go on with the treatment.

425
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,230
It's okay.

426
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,230
This is only the first treatment.

427
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,710
If you receive a few more treatments,

428
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,990
I believe your memories
will be recovered soon.

Moreover, you don't know where he is.

434

If he finds out where you stay,

435
