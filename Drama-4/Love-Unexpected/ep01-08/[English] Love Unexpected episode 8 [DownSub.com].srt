I can only say that

171
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,100

Is it that simple?

199
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,270
It's a good apartment.

200
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,590
It should cost more.

201
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,870
Maybe...

202
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,910
Maybe because it's a recent post.

I can handle it myself.

207

is shared by several families.

219
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,510
There's an elderly couple living upstairs.

220

you can plant something you like too.

224
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,750
I can plant some vegetables

225
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,870
and use them as cooking ingredients.

226
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,630
Not bad.

This is the dining area.

231

Is this place

239
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,550
too small for you?

240
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,590
No.

241
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,950
It's not.

242

Moreover,

they have a garden

244
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,030
and a private kitchen.

245
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,910
I like their decoration style too.

246

It's lovely.

247

when can we sign the contract?

249
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,590
We can sign it now.

250
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,110
I brought the deposit.

251

Aren't you going to bargain?

252
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,510
What's more to bargain?

253
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,550
If I'm short of money,

254
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,510
I will find a part-time job.

255
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,350
In that case,

256
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,190
can I have your identity card?

257
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,390

you must promise me something.

414

00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,070
very,

573
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,510
very good friends.

574
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,910
I stay here alone.

575
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,070
You can

576
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,670
stay here overnight.

577
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,870
I'll take the bed then.

578
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,030
[The Yu Xiao Yue whom I knew]

579
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,510
[was easy-going,]

580
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,870
[independent and confident.]

581
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,630
[I never thought that]

582
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,190
[she spent her childhood
at the welfare home.]

583
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,630
[What actually happened]

584
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,070
[between Yu Xiao Yue and Qian Ming Yue?]

585
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,980
[How can I help them?]

586
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:38,990
Hello?

587
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:40,940
Aunt Lu.

588
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,750
It's me, Fan Fan.

589
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,430
I would like to invite

590
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,430
your family

591
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,910
and a friend of mine

592
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,790
to my house for a meal.

593
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,390
It's a token of appreciation

594
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,310
for taking care of me all these while.

595
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,630
Sister,

596
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,670
do you want to read this comic book?

597
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,310
No.

598
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,230
It's childish.

599
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,230
I'll read it myself then.

600
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,270
It's quite interesting.

601
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,790
Look, I told you so.

602
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,190
Here comes the fish.

603
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,710
It's a feast, uncle.

604
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,100
Your Uncle Lu made these dishes

605
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,590
all by himself today.

606
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,710
He's a chef.

607
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,390
It looks appetizing, uncle.

608
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,430
You know what?

609
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,910
Your aunt rarely compliments me.

610
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:43,950
Try my cooking.

611
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,990
I outdid myself.

612
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,750
Let's eat.

613
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,350
Uncle Lu.

614
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,310
Let's wait a little longer.

615
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,710
Who else is joining us?

616
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,310
Who's coming?

617
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,350
I'll get the door.

618
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,350
Qian Ming Yue?

619
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,070
He's a famous celebrity.

620
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,990
He's real.

621
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,270
Come in.

622
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,670
Take a seat.

623
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,310
Please help yourself.

624
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,470
Sit down.

625
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,630
He's real.

626
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,510
Let me introduce to you.

627
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,800
This is my friend.

628
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,670
Qian Ming Yue.

629
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,670
Hello, uncle.

630
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,870
Hello, aunt.

631
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,110
Nice to meet you.

632
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,150
Ming Yue.

633
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,270
You're so handsome.

634
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,270
Everyone is here.

635
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,270
Let's eat.

636
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,910
Let's eat.

637
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,350
Dig in.

638
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,350
Try my cooking.

639
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,070
I made them.

640
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,550
Okay.

641
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,270
Here you go, little sister.

642
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,630
Have some meat.

643
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,470
So the both of you

644
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,350
are siblings?

645
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,670
No wonder you look alike.

646
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,430
I'm not that lucky to have

647
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,550
a celebrity brother.

648
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,750
Qian.

649
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,590
Can you drink?

650
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,470
A little.

651
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,070
Well.

652
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,590
I must raise my glass today.

653
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,550
Look.

654
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,710
A celebrity came today.

655
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,830
We'll be blessed with good luck.

656
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,430
Right?

657
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,630
We're having a good time.

658
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,510
All the happiness

659
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,390
are in this drink.

660
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,790
Raise your glass.

661
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,750
Cheers.

662
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,030
Cheers.

663
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,910
Thank you, uncle.

664
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,030
Did you get the wrong information?

665
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,060
No.

666
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,430
She is really in there.

667
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,190
She's with that lady

668
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,390
who made us return without the money.

669
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,350
Do they know each other?

670
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,070
Off we go.

671
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,910
Let's go home.

672
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,350
Slow down, Lu Fen Jin.

673
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,990
I got it.

674
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,070
Lu.

675
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,110
We're leaving now.

676
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,910
Goodbye, Aunt Lu.

677
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,750
Bye.

678
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,510
-Bye.
-Bye.

679
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,190
Thank you

680
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,350
for today, Fan Fan.

681
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,230
From now on,

682
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,110
I'll take care of Xiao Yue.

683
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,430
Thank you.

684
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,150
Silly Lady.

685
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,870
From now on,

686
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,550
you must take good care of her.

687
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,670
I will.

688
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,300
We'll get going.

689
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,510
Bye.

690
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,430
Bye.

691
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,740
Look.

692
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,420
I told you that they're inside.

693
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,190
It's them, right?

694
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,990
Wait a minute.

695
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,270
The person beside her...

696
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,630
Let's go for a ride.

697
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,910
Qian Ming Yue?

698
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,310
She's together with a celebrity?

699
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,630
She's unbelievable.

700
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,810
[Stay tuned for the post-credits scene!]

701
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,440

It's too good.

719
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:29,870
Coming up next

720
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,310
is the question and answer session
open to fans.

721
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,430
The selected fan

will receive an album

723
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,860
with Qian Ming Yue's autograph.

724
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,310
Autograph?

725
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,870
I must be selected.

726
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,670
Pick me!

727
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,950
Let's have the guy with dark blue shirt

728
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,990
to ask a question.

729
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,190
Yes, don't hesitate. It's you.

730
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,870
First of all,

731
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,790
thank you for singing a song

732
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,990
that describes my recent experience.

733
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,310
I have a question for you.

734
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,260
Have you ever met
a person you love the most

735
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,630
who you know is impossible to be with,

736
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,510
but you still want to defy the odds?

737
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,230
Yes.

738
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,310
She's not my lover,

739
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,180
but she's the most important person
in my life.

740
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,150
Buddy.

741
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,790
If you also

742
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,550
meet the person

743
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,510
you think is the most important to you,

744
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,870
you must not give up.

745
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:50,070
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

746
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,750
Thank you.

747
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,630
Alright. Next,

748
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,340
let's get another fan to ask a question.

749
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,150
Why did you ask that question?

750
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,950
I just want to thank you.

751
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,670
Thank...

752
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,910
Thank me?

753
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,990
I should be the one to thank you.

754
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,550
You even brought me to this fans meeting.

755
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,030
Fan Fan.

756
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,150
Thank you for coming into my life.

757
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,830
Thank you for changing my life too.

758
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,470
I really love you.

759
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,510
I'm sorry.
