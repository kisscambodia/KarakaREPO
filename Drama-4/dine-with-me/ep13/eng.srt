1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,120
I thought you said you were dizzy recently

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,520
And intermittent pain

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,840
Why didn't you tell her that

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,000
If it's okay
free at kisskh.me

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,600
Why worry her

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
If something happens

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,640
It's no use worrying about her

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,120
Thrombotic heart failure

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,360
Thrombolytic conservative treatment

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,560
The harm is less

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,800
But not necessarily

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,080
Can completely solve the problem

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,760
There is a risk of thrombus shedding

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,920
Surgery can

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,960
Thoroughly treat vascular necrosis

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
But your physical condition

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,920
It's not good at all

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,120
There may be other risks

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,840
Hello, your courier

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
Thank you

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,440
Have a good life

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,480
Walk slowly

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,440
Get an injection before eating

24
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
How did the copywriter do it

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,320
Ah

26
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,240
Since Sister Colan left,

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,000
The temper guide is getting worse and worse

28
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,520
After the last location

29
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
Yu always doesn't come to the program very often

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
I just don't want Sister Colan

31
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,440
Come into contact with the guide again

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,400
Listen to "what to eat" said the man over there

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
Sister Kelan and Yu Hao

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,360
It's about to be made public

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,440
Then we have two days

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,640
Do you want to take a leave of absence

37
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,600
What are you doing again

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,200
Didn't I tell you

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,400
Don't give it to me all day

40
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
Hurry up and be in a hurry

41
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
Come quickly

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,680
One hundred thousand urgent

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,480
Deadly

44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,080
Come and sit down

45
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,560
Today, Sister Bi made a reservation to celebrate

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,560
What

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,280
Our family Hao Hao

48
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,760
In my villa in the same neighborhood

49
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,800
Bought a house

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
Walk from my home

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
It only takes five minutes

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,960
Five minutes yo

53
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,040
Cheers

54
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,440
He bought it for Su Kelan

55
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,400
And Mother Sue

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,280
They will live in a new home together in the future

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
What are you happy about

58
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,080
Then I don't care

59
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
Where can he buy it

60
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,440
Just buy next door to me

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,880
That clearly implies that

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
Hint

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,520
Drink

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,480
Eat

65
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,480
Come

66
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
Finish eating and drinking

67
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,440
Go with me to buy some lamps

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,200
I want to hang it on the outer wall

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,320
And the garden

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm going to make my home

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
Become a whole community

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,800
The brightest building

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
So Hao Hao comes back every day

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
You can see me

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Will you be clear-headed

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,040
All along

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
You're all alone

78
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
I'm talking to myself

79
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,200
Blind thinking for oneself

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
In addition to Yu Hao in your mind,

81
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,800
Can you decorate something else

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,400
Can you have a little life of your own

83
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Don't give you any more

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,000
Thoughts at sixes and sevens all day long

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
Pull me out

86
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,080
Have the time

87
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
Isn't it good to read more books

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,640
Don't let people laugh at you forever

89
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,600
Aren't you stupid

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
What did you say about me

91
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
I said you have no brains

92
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,040
Love oneself and bring disgrace to oneself

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,280
Do you know what it means

94
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,760
What does the idiom bring disgrace to oneself mean

95
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,920
Why don't I explain it to you

96
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Original

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
That's how you always see me

98
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,360
Then you still listen to me all day

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,960
Change the image

100
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,880
Run around with me

101
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,600
Be sick

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
Or do you think I'm a fool

103
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
It's fun to be busy, isn't it

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,520
And I've been busy for so long

105
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,360
Am I doing it for myself

106
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,360
Do I spend all my time

107
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,200
It's all for you

108
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,880
You said I was flattered

109
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,240
What about you

110
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Chatter and chatter

111
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
I can't say a word I like

112
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,680
As soon as people refuse you,

113
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,800
You're awesome, you're smart

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm stupid

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,080
But at least I'm sincere

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
I can try

117
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,480
Than some

118
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,000
A bag that will only hide in the corner

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
Much better, huh

120
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Is Sister Bi better

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
The guide is in a bad mood today

122
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,880
It's just you who talk to him

123
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,200
He can be in a better mood

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
It's up to you to comfort him

125
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
Why are you following me

126
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm sorry

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,320
Don't you crocodile

128
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,360
Didn't you always

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,600
Treat me like a joke

130
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,400
Just telling the truth

131
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,720
There's nothing to apologize for

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm not

133
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,680
Actually, I'm the one who's stupid

134
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm just taking it out on you

135
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,320
I want to let myself

136
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,280
Don't appear so incompetent

137
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,040
That's why we belittle

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,320
And deny all your efforts

139
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm not just stupid

140
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,120
Still incompetent

141
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,600
Come on

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,480
You just call me stupid

143
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,160
Said I was flattered

144
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,880
Bring disgrace to oneself

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,160
You're not stupid

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,480
Every idiom you just said

147
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,400
None of them are wrong

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
Do you think this way

149
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,640
Is comfort appropriate

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm sorry

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,800
Thank you

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you

153
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,320
Comfort me

154
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
You will know that you are fierce with me

155
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
Fierce me, fierce me

156
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,600
You think

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,600
I don't know myself

158
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,680
Is it self-love

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,680
You think

160
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,960
I don't know

161
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,280
Surely Yu Hao won't like me

162
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
I just want to make

163
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,280
Be happy yourself

164
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't want to be so sad

165
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
I'll lie to myself and say

166
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,480
Diamond

167
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,800
You will have hope

168
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
You just have to work hard

169
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,320
It will pay off
free at kisskh.me

170
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
I just want every day

171
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
Everyone is happy

172
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,280
Am I wrong

173
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm like this

174
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Is it really stupid

175
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,600
Won't

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,960
You're the one I've ever seen

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,720
Most sincere

178
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,240
The person who works the hardest

179
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,480
Those who deny you

180
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,120
It's all because

181
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
They can't do it by themselves

182
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,560
So I hope to see your jokes

183
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,680
Just like me

184
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,720
It's all

185
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,920
They are all particularly bad ideas

186
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,600
You don't have to worry about this

187
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,840
Sad at a bad eye

188
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,160
Because when one day

189
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,080
You run farther

190
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,880
When flying higher,

191
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
They'll all envy you

192
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,120
Really

193
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,000
Really

194
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,560
Come on, come on

195
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,040
Today, Jin Dao and Bi Jie

196
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
Invite everyone to dinner together

197
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,120
Thank you, sister Bi

198
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,440
Where's Jin Dao

199
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
What's the matter with you

200
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,400
I thought we agreed to have dinner together

201
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,040
And said he wanted to apologize

202
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,680
What's going on

203
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,280
It's for you

204
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,560
You

205
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,960
Didn't I say before

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,480
Dislike

207
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,800
Is it in front of the mobile phone

208
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,520
Just

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,640
No, it won't

210
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,280
Like it very much

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,600
That's good

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
Let's eat

213
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,680
Eat and sit down

214
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,480
I said you do this

215
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,800
Particularly delicious

216
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,840
Time for dinner

217
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,800
Ah good

218
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,000
Sit down quickly, sister Bi

219
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,080
It's made by delicious sister Bi

220
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Eat more if it is delicious

221
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,040
Is that the guide has done too little

222
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
Just one dish

223
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Pick up Kelan's mother on the way

224
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,040
Go to the hospital for an examination

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,720
You won't have to join in the fun

226
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,640
I have to continue to be a strategist for you

227
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Although Hao Hao and I

228
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,120
There is no hope

229
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,120
But Su Kelan's mother

230
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
I like you

231
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,080
I asked you to go to the hospital for examination

232
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
Prove that you want to be a son-in-law more

233
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,280
Besides, Su Kelan

234
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,400
Care so much about mom

235
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
Mother's opinion is of course important

236
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
You still have a good chance of winning

237
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,240
Wait for me

238
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,640
Aunt

239
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,000
What's the matter

240
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,240
No one

241
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
The door is unlocked

242
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,840
Why don't you go in and have a look

243
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
I'm coming in

244
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,480
Let's just go in and wait

245
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
It would be nice if you didn't

246
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,760
Aunt

247
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
What happened to Auntie

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,800
Rise up

249
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,480
Don't move, don't move

250
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,480
Can't move

251
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,840
Call Su Kelan

252
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,920
I'll call 120

253
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Overdose of insulin

254
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,000
Causing hypoglycemia

255
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,600
Life is in danger now

256
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,920
But Lan still can't get in touch

257
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,080
How do you do

258
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,640
The number you dialed is turned off

259
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,480
Sister Kelan

260
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,800
You are thinking of meeting Yang Zong

261
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,680
Be nervous

262
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,200
It's really a little

263
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,160
Nothing

264
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,120
Our gift

265
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,640
Someone has been arranged

266
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,520
It was delivered in advance

267
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,680
Reach out and don't hit smiling faces

268
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,160
No matter how fierce the investor is, he is also a human being

269
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,600
Since you are still

270
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
If you are so nervous,

271
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,960
Or we'll go home

272
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,920
Don't go

273
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,320
OK, let Yang Zhen

274
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,960
And feel what it means

275
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
The feeling of not being seen by others

276
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,960
Dear travelers and friends

277
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
We have safely

278
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,680
Fly to a destination

279
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,560
Fly to a destination

280
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,360
When disembarking

281
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,520
Please take all your luggage with you

282
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,920
Not Yu Zong's side

283
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,800
Is there anything going on

284
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
Feed gold guide

285
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,320
Colan

286
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,520
Sister Kelan, what's wrong with you

287
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
Sister Kelan, are you all right

288
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,680
Sister Kelan, don't scare me

289
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,080
Sister Kelan

290
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,320
Squeeze what squeeze ah

291
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,360
Colan

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,960
Colan

293
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,920
Colan, your mother

294
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,120
How do you do

295
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,880
A plane ticket home

296
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
Could you speak up, Miss

297
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
I want to change my air ticket home

298
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,520
Where is your home

299
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,200
Chongqing

300
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,160
What time is it

301
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,320
Fastest

302
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,880
May I have your identification, please

303
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,840
Did you drop it

304
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
You can go to the third floor

305
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
Go through the temporary ID card

306
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
How do you do? Is this Yao Qian

307
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,040
Ah yes

308
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,880
This is Zhao Zhao from Shanghai Company

309
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
Where's your Sue

310
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,920
How do you do, madam

311
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,000
Excuse me, are you not feeling well

312
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,960
The investors will be here soon

313
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,040
Do you think we should go first

314
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,320
All right

315
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,600
Diamond

316
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,280
Mr. Shi called you

317
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,480
Lao Wu

318
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Investment in "What to Eat"

319
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,440
I inquired about the situation

320
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,360
I think we should be cautious.

321
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,120
I met Yu Hao

322
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
And his team

323
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,440
It should be reliable

324
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,120
How about this

325
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
I arranged for you

326
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
Meet them, too

327
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,400
All right

328
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,160
Contact Mr. Su

329
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Tell her to arrange it as soon as possible

330
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,400
Yu Hao and Wu Dong meet

331
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,240
OK

332
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,200
My interview is over

333
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,200
What's the situation over there

334
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Yu Zong's investors have arrived

335
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,920
But Sister Colan

336
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,760
I don't know where I went

337
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,320
People are gone

338
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,760
I'll be right there

339
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,960
Hello, the number you dialed

340
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,120
Shut down

341
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,760
Xiaoyan Airport

342
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,520
Ladies and gentlemen

343
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,080
The plane is about to arrive

344
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
Beautiful "Mountain City" Chongqing

345
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,320
How's Auntie

346
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,560
Still being rescued

347
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,920
Colan has already called me back

348
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,080
Is rushing back

349
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,760
Yang Zong

350
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,400
This way

351
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,680
This way

352
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,720
Colan

353
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,600
My mother

354
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
How's my mom

355
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,040
Who is Villi's family

356
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,520
This

357
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
Please sign here

358
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,960
It's okay, Kelan

359
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm sure I can save it

360
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
This is the normal process of the hospital

361
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,360
Thank you, Doctor

362
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,680
Good

363
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,800
The number you dialed

364
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,240
There is no answer for the time being

365
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,480
Colan

366
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,960
Dr. Wang, how is my mother

367
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,040
I got an extra shot of insulin

368
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
Severe hypoglycemia causes shock

369
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,600
It's a good thing he was in time

370
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,680
Take your mother to the hospital

371
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,480
Thank you

372
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,440
Is there any problem with thrombosis and heart failure

373
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,960
Thrombotic heart failure

374
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,960
The last time your mother had dialysis,

375
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,440
Your friend came with her

376
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,240
Thrombosis and heart failure were detected

377
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,480
After getting out of danger

378
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,560
You think about it

379
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,400
Do you put your body

380
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
After raising it,

381
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,800
Have the operation done

382
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,560
Colan

383
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,360
Your mother is in poor health

384
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,520
No matter how busy you are, you should care

385
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,880
Spend more time with her

386
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,880
You came with my mother

387
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,440
You know she's not doing well

388
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,160
Why didn't you tell me

389
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm sorry, Colan

390
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:17,960
I thought

391
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,680
Why didn't you tell me

392
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Your own mother

393
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,160
You don't care enough

394
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Someone else has helped you so much

395
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,200
And you yell at people

396
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm sorry

397
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm sorry

398
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,040
I'm sorry

399
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm sorry

400
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Colan

401
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm sorry

402
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,200
What time is it

403
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Haven't come yet

404
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,480
Yeah

405
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,040
Can't keep putting us

406
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,640
Let's hang it here

407
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,320
That's right

408
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
Excuse me, bosses

409
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,400
Our Su Zong

410
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,400
Sue, she suddenly came out

411
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,480
A matter of great urgency

412
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,200
I

413
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,680
Xiaoyao is fine

414
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,040
You've said it many times

415
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,640
How about this

416
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,480
Let's eat first and wait

417
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,240
Yu Hao should be here soon

418
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,400
Good

419
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,800
This

420
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,360
What's the situation here

421
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,320
Didn't she invite us

422
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,120
Right

423
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,120
Yu Hao said

424
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
She is ill

425
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
Be ill

426
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,280
She has our number

427
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,360
Now that she is ill,

428
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,600
It's time to talk to all of us

429
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,120
Just say hello in advance

430
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,880
I'm really sorry

431
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,920
Colan, she said temporarily

432
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,800
Not feeling well

433
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,280
So I've kept you waiting

434
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,160
I'm sorry for her

435
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,880
Come and eat, eat

436
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,240
Yu Hao

437
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,400
You are a vice president

438
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,760
You'd better be careful

439
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,680
What, be careful

440
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
I shouldn't have used this man at all

441
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,560
Yu Hao

442
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,560
We started our business from you

443
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,600
Invest in the capital from the beginning

444
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,280
I'm optimistic about you because I've always been

445
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,840
You are a very rational person

446
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,920
The company has developed to the present

447
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,360
You also gave a lot

448
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,440
But since this Su Kelan

449
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,280
After appearing

450
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,240
You become confused

451
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Yes

452
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,320
You fall in love

453
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,680
We have no reason to interfere

454
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,800
But you've been in love

455
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,880
Seriously affected the operation

456
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,600
Do you know

457
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,280
Seriously affect the operation

458
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,520
Which number do you come from

459
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:55,800
See it

460
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,720
I influenced the operation

461
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,840
Yu Hao

462
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm going to do as you do

463
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,160
That will definitely be affected

464
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,120
Who is Su Kelan

465
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Dare to send a circle of friends to force the palace

466
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,720
You're really hooked up

467
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,120
I told you she didn't send the video

468
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,640
Good

469
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
You think it's us

470
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,880
It's biased, isn't it

471
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,800
So today is you

472
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,240
Let her treat us to this meal

473
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,360
But what about the result

474
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,400
Where are the people

475
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,080
Does she buy your account

476
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,240
People don't look at character

477
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,480
I just wanted to ask you

478
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,680
What makes you judge

479
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,720
She didn't come on purpose

480
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,400
And by what judgment

481
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,240
She has a bad character

482
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,800
Have you ever seen

483
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,200
Is her normal working ability

484
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,520
Have you investigated

485
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,600
Her performance level

486
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
You rely solely on some

487
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,520
Peach news and gossip

488
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,840
Just discredit a person

489
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,400
You guys are like this

490
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,480
Those keyboard men on the Internet

491
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,080
What's the difference

492
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,320
Yu Hao

493
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,280
Let's go out and talk

494
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,320
Just a moment

495
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,840
A lot of times I know

496
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,200
There are some words you don't like to hear

497
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,800
It doesn't sound good either

498
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,880
But those words

499
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,800
It all makes sense

500
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,000
She's really sick

501
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,720
Didn't you come

502
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,600
Or you don't know where she is

503
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,600
Jin Dao

504
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,760
I'm sorry

505
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,320
Just now

506
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm blaming myself

507
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,760
Didn't take good care of my mother

508
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,120
Angry at you

509
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm really sorry

510
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,840
It is estimated that it will take a long time

511
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,920
Why don't I give it to everyone

512
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,640
Order something to eat

513
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,400
Sister Meng Kelan suddenly disappeared

514
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,600
Do you know where she went

515
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,880
Hello Cece

516
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,440
Hello Sister Meng

517
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,680
Sister Kelan, did she find it

518
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,760
Something happened at her house

519
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,960
Please, please

520
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,320
So say

521
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,600
You don't even know her

522
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,200
Yu Hao

523
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,800
What the hell are you doing

524
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,360
Are you all right

525
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm okay

526
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,280
It's good to be okay

527
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,480
Nothing

528
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,280
Why did you suddenly disappear

529
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,000
I didn't answer the phone either

530
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,800
What the hell

531
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm sorry. I

532
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,840
Do you know or not

533
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,440
What are we doing here today

534
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,520
Told me this morning

535
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,040
To stand people up

536
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,080
Are you serious

537
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,120
Do you do this

538
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,760
I know I

539
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
What do you know

540
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,040
Now Yang Zhen and all the directors

541
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,800
Trust in you

542
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,240
Have completely dropped to freezing point

543
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,160
So you can come here at once

544
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,200
We can still pull it over

545
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,120
I can't come

546
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,760
Why can't my mother come

547
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,280
Now everyone is waiting for you alone

548
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,480
Do you know or not

549
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,400
Hello

550
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,400
Su Kelan

551
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,560
Are you listening to me

552
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,720
What else is going on

553
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,440
Than the two of us

554
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,240
Go forward together

555
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,160
More important

556
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,640
Hello

557
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:41,840
Hello

558
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,640
Su Kelan

559
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,440
I said I couldn't come

560
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,600
Don't you understand

561
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,400
Also

562
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,400
Anyway, my business

563
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,480
You don't want to hear it at all

564
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:55,960
Don't care

565
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,680
It's just your business

566
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,200
Is the most important thing, isn't it

567
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,760
My mother is critically ill

568
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,960
I'll be with you right away

569
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,320
What's the matter

570
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,960
Su Kelan's mother is critically ill

571
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,440
The investment thing

572
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,360
Forget it

573
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,160
Feeding stone chief

574
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,560
I've been looking for you all day

575
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,560
Mr. Yu finally has time to call back

576
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,000
Excuse me, Mr. Shi

577
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,880
It's a little urgent today

578
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,760
That Yu Hao

579
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,320
I was supposed to be holding

580
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,240
Pressure from the board of directors

581
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Want to vote for you

582
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,640
But all day long you guys

583
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,560
I can't get in touch

584
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,680
Let me be in Lao Wu

585
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,840
How to hang up that face

586
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
People like you

587
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,560
I don't want to cooperate

588
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,520
What time is it? I haven't come yet

589
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,920
So long

590
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
I've been waiting for so long

591
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,040
Excuse me

592
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,240
It's urgent. I'll go first

593
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,760
I just heard that Sok Li stopped voting

594
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,080
Yu Hao

595
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,440
I sympathize with her family emergency

596
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,400
But you need to know who you are

597
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,760
You're not only responsible for her

598
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,640
You have to pay attention to all the

599
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,400
Investors are responsible

600
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,600
I've already said that

601
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,520
Su Kelan's mother is critically ill

602
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,800
Yu Hao has already flown back

603
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,640
Out of danger

604
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,680
Yu Hao

605
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,320
Yu Hao

606
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,120
It was Yang Zhen who told you

607
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,080
My flight information

608
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,040
I really don't have time now

609
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,520
Let's talk about anything later

610
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,960
If you really do

611
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,600
For the good of Su Kelan

612
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,080
You just stop and listen to me

613
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,480
Su Kelan's mother is critically ill

614
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,600
Everyone is sympathetic

615
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,720
But Sok Li's investment

616
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,840
It's really because she can't help it

617
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,320
Timely handling

618
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:28,880
Yellow

619
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,360
If you don't deal with it

620
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,240
She really caused it

621
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,080
The loss of the company

622
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
How do you want her to talk to each other in the future

623
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,880
Get along with your partners

624
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,000
How to get along with you

625
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,640
You go to Su Kelan now

626
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,520
Her mother's illness

627
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,400
It won't get better

628
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,360
But you deal with the problem now

629
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,160
There may be a remedy

630
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,160
But Sok Lee and I

631
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,960
I didn't deal with it in the first place

632
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,760
Don't look for him, look for Yun Teng

633
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,480
Frank and I have a good personal relationship

634
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,160
I'll come back this time

635
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,560
I was supposed to help you match up

636
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,840
I'll help you

637
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,640
It's also to help her

638
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,560
Why don't you go back and get your things first

639
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,960
I'm here

640
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,320
I want to wait for my mother to wake up

641
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,240
Why hasn't it arrived yet

642
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,360
Check it out

643
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,800
What other disputes have occurred in the past three years

644
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Find them all

645
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,960
Confirmed

646
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,160
Tomorrow with Frank

647
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,080
Meet in Beijing

648
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
Angie, book a trip for me

649
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,080
The earliest flight tomorrow

650
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,560
Good

651
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,960
I'll be busy with something urgent in the company first

652
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,480
I'll meet you at the hospital later tomorrow

653
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Angie, give me that file

654
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,840
Wake up

655
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,280
Mengmeng, I'll make a phone call

656
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,720
Okay, go ahead

657
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,600
The number you dialed

658
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,000
There is no answer for the time being

659
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,840
It's over

660
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,640
Lawyer Lai Shao

661
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,520
That

662
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,200
Thank you.

663
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,880
Stay up with me all night

664
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,920
Hard work

665
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,640
Nothing

666
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,160
You're welcome

667
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,680
It's all included in the working hours

668
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,240
Go away

669
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
Let me help you with it

670
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,120
I think according to

671
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,880
For this version,

672
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
We can have

673
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,040
This modification

674
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,240
It's okay. Why don't you go to work

675
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
I'm here
free at kisskh.me

676
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,000
Mr. Li

677
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,240
In any case

678
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,040
I will take Mr. Yu to see Wu Dong

679
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,080
Please rest assured

680
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,720
There is still a while before the flight takes off

681
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,320
Let me check the documents for you again

682
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,080
You are a person who knocks the code carefully

683
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,600
Others are confused

684
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,760
You see

685
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,320
A brief account of your performance last year

686
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,360
Why is it so untidy

687
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,240
Where is the scrawl

688
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,120
Isn't it quite clear

689
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Just because you know doesn't mean others know

690
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,960
How about a little attitude of being Party B

691
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,960
I changed it for you

692
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,160
Respect each other

693
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,320
Reduce dyslexia

694
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,480
You can't look past one side

695
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,720
I'll change it myself while you go

696
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,960
Then I'll check the others for you

697
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,960
Don't change it for me

698
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,720
I changed it. Can you see that

699
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,640
If you have the ability, you can check it again

700
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,520
Hello

701
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,640
Sister Kelan, I'm sorry

702
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,120
I was in the company with Mr. Yu last night

703
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,160
Work overtime all night

704
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,160
I fell asleep and didn't hear your call

705
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,520
Hard work

706
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,680
Excuse me

707
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,440
Shi Zong

708
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,240
Xiao Su

709
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,400
I know there is an accident at your home

710
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,480
As a friend

711
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,760
I understand and sympathize with you

712
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,560
I also wish your mother a speedy recovery

713
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,760
But in business, we only look at the results

714
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,200
I hope to pick

715
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,800
Emotionally stable partners

716
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,120
Mr. Shi, I'm sorry

717
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,200
I will definitely face to face

718
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,360
To apologize to Wu Dong

719
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,600
Please give me another chance

720
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,920
Wu Dong takes his family abroad for vacation

721
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,880
Has already boarded the plane

722
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,360
Can you wait for him

723
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,360
I'll talk about it when I get back

724
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,560
I heard that Yu Hao's side

725
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,280
I contacted Yun Teng through Shen Zhilin

726
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,520
Go to Beijing to talk to Frank today

727
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,360
Wish him all the best

728
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,960
Don't you call me either

729
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,120
I need a rest

730
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,880
Shi Zong I

731
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,400
You also take care of your family with peace of mind

732
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,560
Just like it says

733
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,280
What about our company

734
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:33,960
Almost now

735
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,360
There are 480 employees

736
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,480
Bachelor degree or above accounted for 98.5%

737
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,920
And then our company's

738
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,120
What about concepts? Actually

739
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:18,760
Colan

740
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,560
Your mother is in poor health

741
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,720
No matter how busy you are, you should care

742
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,080
Spend more time with her

743
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,080
Happy cooperation

744
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,000
Happy cooperation

745
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,000
Mr. Yu, this project

746
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,840
Very good

747
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,320
So expect us

748
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,200
The next cooperation

749
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,120
Let's go first

750
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,480
Yu Hao

751
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,120
Frank has an appointment

752
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,000
Friends have lunch together

753
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,040
You're really not coming

754
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,760
Maybe next time. There's something urgent

755
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,840
We have to get back first

756
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,920
Thank you today

757
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,240
Go back and bring Colan

758
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,920
Invite you to dinner together

759
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,640
I gotta go. It's gonna be late

760
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,240
Colan

761
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,080
I'll do it

762
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,880
No need

763
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,760
I'm sorry

764
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,360
I'm giving you trouble

765
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,600
Nothing

766
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,800
You just take care of your aunt with peace of mind

767
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,200
Leave the company to me

768
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,160
Yu Hao

769
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,600
The position of vice president

770
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,280
You hire someone new

771
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,960
I know you are very tired these days

772
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,320
So you can have a rest for a while

773
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,280
When do you want to come back?

774
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,000
Can you come back again

775
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,120
I don't want to go back

776
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,640
I can't imagine such a thing

777
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,440
Happened again

778
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,040
All right, during this time

779
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,160
You can leave nothing to yourself

780
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,320
Just take care of your aunt with peace of mind

781
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:47,920
Good or not

782
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,760
I'm sorry

783
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,720
I overestimated my ability

784
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,000
I took it

785
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Such an important job

786
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,080
But it turns out to be trouble everywhere

787
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,800
I gave my mother trouble

788
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,600
Give Jin Xuan Diamond trouble

789
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,880
Give you trouble

790
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:12,960
I'll go up with you

791
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:13,960
No need

792
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,800
I think

793
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,200
We should calm down for a while

794
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,240
What do you mean

795
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,840
Yu Hao

796
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,960
I don't want to love you anymore

797
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,040
Ignoring my mother

798
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,720
But I don't miss you either

799
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,200
To accommodate me

800
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,800
Delayed your career

801
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,480
I think we should

802
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,440
Think it over again

803
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,440
Our relationship

804
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,280
What do you mean

805
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,440
Think about our relationship

806
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,320
I don't think we can

807
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,760
Adapt to each other's rhythm

808
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,160
Colan

809
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,160
Where else do I have

810
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,720
Not doing well enough

811
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,680
You can tell me

812
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,200
There's nothing wrong with you

813
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,960
It's just that we're different

814
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,480
I have a job

815
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,240
But my mother

816
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,360
After something happened

817
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,800
I can only take care of my mother

818
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,240
And I know you care about me

819
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,480
But you know

820
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,840
After what happened to my mother

821
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,920
You are the choice

822
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,240
Working with Shen Zhilin

823
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,600
Have you been to the company

824
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,040
I did it for you

825
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,320
I don't want the future

826
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,800
You are embarrassed in front of Yang Zhen

827
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,240
And I don't want people at the company

828
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,480
Think the loss this time

829
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,600
You caused it

830
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,240
This is what you think is important

831
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,120
But this is for me

832
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,400
It doesn't matter at all

833
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,080
Have you ever thought about

834
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,240
What do I need

835
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,360
The most important thing for me

836
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,480
It's mom

837
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,240
For you

838
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,000
It's a career

839
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,760
In essence

840
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,360
We are not the same kind of people

841
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,600
Even if you barely go down now

842
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,920
It will still be in the future

843
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,960
What kind of person am I

844
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,600
I used to

845
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,400
I have been afraid to accept this relationship

846
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,000
Because I'm afraid of failing you

847
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,520
You encouraged me

848
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,960
Let me take that step

849
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,520
I didn't take care of people before

850
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,200
I will now

851
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,240
I used to

852
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,760
I don't know how to communicate with others

853
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,000
But I can now

854
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,200
Chatting with your mother

855
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,720
But you tell me

856
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,320
We are not the same kind of people

857
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,280
I'm sorry I was wrong

858
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,480
I underestimated it

859
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,720
The difficulty of a relationship

860
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,680
What's the difficulty

861
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:47,960
Colan

862
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,720
What happened to Auntie was an accident

863
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,640
There will inevitably be accidents in life

864
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,360
But it doesn't happen every day

865
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,960
Yu Hao, what do you like about me

866
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,800
You like me

867
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,160
Not because I can cook

868
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,000
Can take care of you

869
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,480
You like me

870
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,200
Can help you in your career

871
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,640
What you like is a man

872
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,280
Covering everything

873
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,000
Can do anything

874
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,200
Handled Su Kelan

875
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,600
I used to think

876
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,280
I can do it

877
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,360
But I was wrong. I can't do it

878
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,360
Love, it's actually

879
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,200
Can't stand the test at all

880
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,040
I don't want one day in the future

881
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,720
You'll blame me for not being able to do all this

882
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,600
Because it's simply

883
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,960
It's not who I am.

884
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,400
I'm sorry

885
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,800
I'm sorry

886
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,240
In pairs

887
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,760
This place in the future

888
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,720
It belongs only to me

889
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,080
Good

890
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,600
Your mother has

891
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,400
Out of danger

892
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,800
It needs more care

893
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,720
My friend got in touch

894
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,760
Professor Sun from Union Medical College Hospital

895
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,280
Consult at any time if necessary

896
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
Thank you, Jin Dao

897
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,480
For my mother's sake

898
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,360
I've been busy all night

899
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,160
It's okay

900
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,720
Don't think about anything

901
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,600
Auntie will definitely get better

902
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,520
Have you ever thought about

903
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,720
What do I need

904
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,040
In essence

905
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,760
We are not the same kind of people

906
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,680
How's Auntie

907
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,680
Just woke up once

908
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,200
The doctor came to see

909
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,000
Nothing

910
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,160
You blame him

911
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,600
Didn't come to you at the first time

912
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,880
Angie told me everything

913
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:23,920
He's because

914
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,560
I know

915
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,160
I don't blame him

916
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,000
Then why are you still like this

917
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,600
He doesn't fit in with me

918
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,080
There is someone more suitable for him

919
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,960
Didn't I tell you

920
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,800
He doesn't want you to take the blame

921
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,760
Cai and Shen Zhilin

922
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,120
What he loves is work

923
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,840
He was with me at first

924
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,560
It's not because I love my family

925
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,760
But because of my effective work

926
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,720
Clear organization

927
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,360
Isn't it

928
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,280
But now I'm

929
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,080
I can't work either

930
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,280
There is no reason either

931
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,640
This is temporary

932
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,040
Even if this time is over,

933
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,440
I don't want to be with him anymore

934
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,200
Together

935
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,280
Why

936
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,320
My mother

937
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,960
A while ago

938
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,720
A thrombus was detected

939
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,040
She didn't tell me

940
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,840
Dialysis was supposed to be

941
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,200
I went with her

942
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,600
Colan

943
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,800
Don't think about it

944
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,400
You were busy a while ago

945
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,480
What am I up to

946
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,960
I'm just busy falling in love

947
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,480
My mom, she didn't tell me

948
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,080
I am afraid of delaying me and Yu Hao

949
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,880
Don't get into a corner, okay

950
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,040
It was an accident

951
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,480
Auntie is out of danger

952
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,680
It's all right now

953
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,760
It wasn't an accident

954
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,200
It's because I always patronize

955
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,440
Things with Yu Hao

956
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,680
To ignore my mother

957
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,080
That would have happened

958
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,680
Just now

959
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,280
He showed up just now

960
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,680
In front of me

961
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,840
All I can think about is him

962
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,080
Pictures together

963
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,120
But

964
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,360
But with those pictures

965
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,480
Stacked together

966
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,840
It's a picture of my mother seriously ill

967
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,120
I would even think of

968
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,600
If my mother can't get it back

969
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,120
I

970
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,560
I really don't know

971
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,560
What should I do

972
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,640
I just think

973
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,480
I had to be separated from him

974
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,640
My mother can get better

975
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,920
Coming, coming

976
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,000
Let me get you a glass of water

977
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,880
Gong Wenxing

978
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,840
Am I really doing something wrong

979
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,240
I was wrong

980
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,680
What did I do wrong

981
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Is it really wrong

982
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,120
Mengmeng

983
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,520
I'm worried about Colan

984
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,120
Want to be with her

985
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,240
Then I won't go back tonight

986
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:47,840
Good

987
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,720
I see

988
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:49,880
Bye bye

989
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,200
As a child

990
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,720
My mom always blames my dad

991
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,760
Busy with work without accompanying her

992
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,600
I think it's all my dad's fault

993
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,000
Grow up

994
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,200
Work

995
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,720
I think it was that time again

996
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,040
My mother is too sensitive

997
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,040
Now think about it

998
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,640
In fact, they are all wrong

999
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,800
If I had known

1000
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,320
People who are not in the same world

1001
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,280
Why do you want to be together in the first place

1002
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:36,800
Anjie

1003
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:37,800
Mr. Wang

1004
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,480
This document

1005
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,800
When Yu Zong comes, sign for him

1006
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:42,680
Good

1007
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,280
Anjie

1008
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,480
Yu Zongke Lan Jie Meng Jie

1009
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,560
All are absent

1010
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,640
I didn't say whether it was a business trip or leave

1011
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,400
Do you know what's going on

1012
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,840
Mr. Su has something at home

1013
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,240
I haven't shown up for so many days

1014
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,800
It can't be serious, can it

1015
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,000
Didn't eat

1016
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,720
Eat more or less

1017
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,320
I'll make something to eat myself

1018
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,160
What happened to Su Kelan

1019
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,040
Say what is not a kind of person

1020
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,920
Isn't this deliberately unpleasant

1021
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,600
Then who let Yu Haoyi come back

1022
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,120
I ran to work with Shen Zhilin

1023
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,840
That's because

1024
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,800
He put his career first

1025
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,520
He acquiesces that others think the same way

1026
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,800
But for Colan

1027
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,400
More importantly, her mother

1028
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,280
Her mother is ill in hospital

1029
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,120
Yu Hao doesn't go to the hospital

1030
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,200
Go on a business trip

1031
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,920
Then Yu Hao will go

1032
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,800
I can't let her mother

1033
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,640
Get better

1034
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:12,680
And

1035
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,560
Her mother is ill

1036
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,240
It's not Yu Hao's fault

1037
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,240
Is it all right if you break up your hand disease

1038
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,840
Why are you torturing people like this

1039
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,600
What do you mean by that

1040
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,600
It's all Colan's fault

1041
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:24,760
And

1042
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,080
If it weren't for Yu Hao

1043
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,000
Pull Colan

1044
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,440
Auntie, how can this time

1045
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,760
Don't dare to say anything to Colan

1046
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,240
She is afraid of delay

1047
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,920
She fell in love

1048
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,120
So you said that the present situation

1049
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,480
Yu Hao has no responsibility at all

1050
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,880
This Yu Hao is not guilty to death, is he

1051
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,080
Thinking about what will happen in the future

1052
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,400
Just take care of your aunt together

1053
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,400
Split up what hand

1054
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,520
Yu Hao recently treated her

1055
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,680
Can't she see the change

1056
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,160
Hello

1057
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,120
I will go tomorrow

1058
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,200
Mr. Yu didn't come today

1059
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,320
For fried rice

1060
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,640
It all seems ordinary

1061
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,600
It's very simple

1062
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,600
Ingredients that are readily available

1063
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,840
You can stir-fry it in a pan

1064
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,480
Delicious and full

1065
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,600
Become the easiest happiness to get

1066
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,200
And simple

1067
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,800
Is often the most worthwhile

1068
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,080
Concerned about aftertaste

1069
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,880
The smell of fireworks in the world

1070
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,280
This dish

1071
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,800
It's in everyone's memory

1072
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,200
But what everyone remembers

1073
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,160
They all have different tastes

1074
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,960
The taste in your memory

1075
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,840
What's the taste of the egg

1076
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,640
What ripeness do tomatoes have

1077
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,880
Do you want to put sugar in it or not

1078
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,000
Do you want to put vinegar in it or not

1079
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,360
Do you want to put soy sauce

1080
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,640
Do you want to put onions

1081
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,000
First discovery

1082
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,080
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes outside

1083
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,600
It's not as good as when it's delicious at home

1084
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,560
Just know

1085
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,840
The original simple dish

1086
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,040
It can also be so unique

1087
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,520
I didn't know you liked it

1088
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,640
What cooked eggs

1089
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,520
So I ordered a well-done one

1090
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,160
I asked for a soft-boiled one

1091
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,840
Fried minced meat with cowpea

1092
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,080
And like the kimchi of a family

1093
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,960
Will go from friends to

1094
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,080
Family

1095
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,040
If there is a kitchen

1096
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,840
Can have more such surprises

1097
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,360
The theme of this program

1098
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,360
It's the taste of parting

1099
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,040
The taste of parting

1100
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,400
Is to miss

1101
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,200
Hello

1102
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,800
Have you seen Yu Hao lately

1103
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,080
I can't find him

1104
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,680
You can't reach Yu Hao

1105
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:34,600
Yu Hao

1106
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,840
Yu Hao, are you in there

1107
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,040
Hello, is this property

1108
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,200
My friend put himself

1109
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,160
Locked in the house

1110
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,080
Could you please open the door

1111
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:55,840
Thank you

1112
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,120
Yu Hao

1113
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:03,720
Yu Hao

1114
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,720
Yu Hao

1115
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:22,920
Why are you here

1116
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,640
Everyone is looking for him

1117
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,560
Eat so much

1118
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:37,920
Get up

1119
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:40,920
You're on your own

1120
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,680
Eat so much

1121
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:45,720
Yu Hao

1122
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,320
Yu Hao

1123
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,840
Yu Hao

1124
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,480
Yu Hao

1125
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:53,960
Ambulance
