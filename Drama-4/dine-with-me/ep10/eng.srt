1
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,920
Then I'll go first

2
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,760
Then I'll go back to work first

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,240
For my new job, I have to

4
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,960
Get familiar with it quickly

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,680
Come to my house today after work

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,760
Have dinner together

7
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,840
I

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,120
I have to go home to dinner with my mother

9
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,840
Then you plan to go on

10
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Just run back and forth at both ends

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,760
The situation in my family

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
My mother, she can't live alone

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,360
So this is it

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,680
You get off work early today

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,960
Go with your mother first

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
Then come to my house again

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,520
Eat supper

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm going to work first

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Anjie

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The marketing department

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Are you looking for

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,880
A new spokesman

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
Yeah

24
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,640
Enter the preparation period for listing

25
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,720
There must be promotion work

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,760
Divine mystery

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Don't consult with us

28
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,680
It has a problem with us

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,520
Let's go

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,560
Before Mr. Su entered the office,

31
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,520
Dress as if

32
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
It's not this dress, is it

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,440
Good good

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
It can be no problem

35
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,720
Before Mr. Yu entered the office,

36
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm not wearing it either

37
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,280
This dress

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
I don't know

39
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,320
Mr. Wang

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,640
Do you want to find the public relations department for the plan

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,160
Check it

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,520
Why don't you submit an application

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,080
Also transferred to the public relations department

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,880
Public Relations Department

45
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,680
They are all Su Kelan's people

46
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,480
If this story comes to light

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,640
Inside her ears

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
Accurate bad things

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,160
You still talk to the other company

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
Direct communication

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Good

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,240
OK

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,800
Why is he so scared

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,920
Sue always knows bad things will happen

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,680
Yu Zong and Su Zong

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
What's the relationship now

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,960
Everyone with a discerning eye knows

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,280
If you're the boss's girlfriend

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
Can you agree to this plan

60
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,640
Hello

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
How about this one? Does it look good

62
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,880
Not on the phone

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you going to die

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,480
Right

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm so happy that I'm dying

66
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,200
Yu Han told me

67
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,560
Yu Hao is talking to our company

68
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,000
On the endorsement of "what to eat"

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm going to rekindle my love with him

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360
Are you nuts

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm telling you

72
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,880
Next time, even if you really die,

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,120
Don't you call me either

74
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,800
Don't go

75
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
When I help you transform your image,

76
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
How much effort did it take

77
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm about to break my leg

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Until you have to help me

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,440
When I was a staff officer,

80
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,920
That's your ghost attitude

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,080
What kind of person are you

82
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Kindness turns on vendetta, you

83
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,840
What you changed has a ghost use

84
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
At least for now

85
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Does your mother-in-law like you

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,520
It's not time to give up yet

87
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,240
Refueling

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,720
Quick, quick, quick

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
It's time to repay me

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
How about taking a look at it for me

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,800
My taste. When did you

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,720
It's eye-catching

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,160
At least you are a man

94
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,440
What

95
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,640
I want to fight for Yu Hao

96
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Of course you have to know men's

97
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,160
Preferences

98
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,120
Take a look at it for me

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,440
Which looks good

100
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Are you giving

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,760
Endorsement of the vegetable selling platform

102
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,320
The purpose is to make

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
My sister likes to buy food

104
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,560
What you're wearing

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:03,960
Seduce with

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Buy food like a sister and husband

107
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,560
Sister grocery shopping

108
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,080
You'll be good if you don't smoke

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,000
Yu Hao's brain smoked

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,480
I will ask you to speak for me

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,440
How is it

112
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,040
Professional suit

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,520
Clear or not pure

114
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
Occupational or non-professional

115
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,960
Why are you leaving again

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,720
What's on your mind

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960
Yu Hao and Su Kelan

118
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
Already together

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,800
Then together

120
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,880
Can't we break up

121
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
Su Kelan and Yu Hao

122
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,480
We can't get together at all

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,320
Why

124
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
I heard that

125
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,440
They're not at all

126
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
I didn't live together

127
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Su Kelan's most important

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
What is it

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,280
Not Yu Hao

130
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,480
It's mom

131
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,720
Mom needs someone to take care of her

132
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
So they can't be like

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,480
Living together like a normal couple

134
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,640
The most important thing in Yu Hao

135
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
What is it

136
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
It's work

137
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,040
Not Su Kelan

138
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,960
Do you think they can make it

139
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,200
Then Yu Hao likes to work so much

140
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,960
Of course it is

141
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
It's the best match for me

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,000
He works and I work

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,640
I can still speak for him

144
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,440
Su Kelan

145
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,640
What happened to Su Kelan

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,640
Of course, that's the best match for you

147
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
She cooks and you cook

148
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,240
She likes mom, and so do you

149
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,040
The most important thing is

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,560
Her mother likes you, too

151
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,920
This is a good match

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
I have a plan

153
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,720
Hello Zhao Zong

154
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,960
In the next round of financing,

155
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
This side of the marketing department

156
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,400
What's the action

157
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
Push sales

158
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,560
Yes

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm working on a plan during this time

160
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,920
After having a clear direction,

161
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,080
Report to you in time

162
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,200
Row

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,080
Good

164
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,960
See you later

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,680
Is Mr. Wang free to talk

166
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,240
These data

167
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,480
Be sure to calculate many times

168
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,080
There can be no problems

169
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,040
Good

170
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
And these

171
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,280
Mr. Wang

172
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,560
This is the plan

173
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,120
Give it to me tomorrow

174
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
No problem

175
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
Mr. Wang

176
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
When is the marketing department meeting

177
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
Call me with you

178
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,280
Some investors want to know about it

179
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,640
A plan for promotion

180
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,160
I'll sit in

181
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,240
To report to them

182
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
Why should Mr. Su return it

183
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
Investors move out

184
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
When would you like the meeting

185
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,280
Just let me know

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
Mr. Wang, you are welcome

187
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,920
I'll just be there

188
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
The business of our marketing department

189
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,400
It is also in your charge of the vice president

190
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,040
How can you just attend

191
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,720
Then later

192
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,320
I'll check the time with you again

193
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
I told you about the contract before

194
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Are you done with it

195
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
Processing

196
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,080
As soon as possible

197
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
In particular Article 6

198
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,800
Absolutely not according to

199
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,960
They write like this

200
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,640
In that case

201
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,800
It's too risky for us

202
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,880
Right

203
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,040
You'll talk to the lawyer then

204
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,920
Have a good communication

205
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,360
Choose a compromise

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
Deal with it as soon as possible

207
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,120
It will be over next week

208
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,800
What's the matter

209
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,040
You didn't tell Wang Yi

210
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,680
Am I not vice president

211
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,400
No

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,960
Why

213
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
What about your ability

214
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,920
Be the vice president of the company

215
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,000
There is no problem at all

216
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,560
Besides

217
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,080
You deserve it, too

218
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,560
Have a better career development

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,680
In this way

220
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,600
We have more time

221
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,520
Can be together

222
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,280
Isn't it good

223
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,920
What about my mother

224
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,120
I'll work with you. Who will work with her

225
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
It's not that I won't let you accompany my mother

226
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
I just think

227
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,240
Colan

228
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
What was the focus of your life before

229
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,440
It's always been around your mother

230
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,480
What about yourself

231
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't care at all

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,320
There is no plan

233
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
I really think

234
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,800
You can now

235
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,040
Think more about yourself

236
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
Think more about your own development

237
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
After all

238
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,560
Mom can't stay with you all her life

239
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,160
What do you mean, mom

240
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
Can't accompany me all my life

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,160
I'll go upstairs first

242
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,200
Thank you, Jin Dao

243
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,160
Auntie, you're welcome

244
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,080
Pay more attention to rest at ordinary times

245
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,840
OK

246
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,440
Jin Dao, why are you here

247
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,840
As long as the hoe dances well

248
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm not afraid I can't dig in the corner

249
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,400
Go to Colan's house

250
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,440
Won't that bother her

251
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,520
She is so busy with her work

252
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,960
Many people take care of their mothers

253
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,760
Have a chat

254
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,280
Is she in no hurry to thank you

255
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,640
If you feel embarrassed,

256
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
I can wait downstairs at her house

257
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,680
When she comes back,

258
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,760
I'll help you hold her off

259
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,200
Send you WeChat and you will run

260
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,720
Last time Jin Dao knew I loved fish

261
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
Brought some fish

262
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,800
Thank you.

263
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,160
No

264
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,760
Auntie Kelan

265
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,200
I'll leave you alone

266
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
I have to go

267
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Jin Dao

268
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Thank you for helping all the time, Colan

269
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,680
Find some time

270
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,520
Me and Colan

271
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,960
Please have a good meal

272
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Good

273
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,240
Kelan sends gold guide

274
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,640
No need

275
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,760
I'll just go by myself

276
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,240
Goodbye, aunt

277
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
Walk slowly

278
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,960
Why don't you be sensible

279
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,720
Do you want me to go upstairs

280
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Nothing, no need

281
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,200
You go back first

282
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,840
Don't wait for me

283
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,760
Don't care too much about what you said just now

284
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,920
It's good for me to have dinner with my mother

285
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,840
I'll come to your house after dinner

286
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,800
How to please your mother-in-law

287
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,040
Yu Zong, go up

288
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,280
Go up and see Xiuluo Yard

289
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,400
How exciting

290
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,360
Why are you back

291
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you doing down here so soon

292
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,080
Colan came back

293
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
Why didn't you tell me

294
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,520
I didn't see it when I was distracted

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Where's my cell phone

296
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
Hurry up and look for it

297
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Have a meal before you go

298
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,600
Don't live up to my great arrangement

299
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Arrangement

300
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
What arrangements

301
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm trying to help you

302
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,960
So when Colan came back

303
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,200
You deliberately didn't tell me

304
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,520
I said, how can you be a man

305
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,600
Su Kelan

306
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,280
Go, go, go, go

307
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,000
Colan

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Jin Dao

309
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,680
You don't have your cell phone

310
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,120
To

311
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,080
Thank you

312
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
It's my turn to thank you

313
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,080
I'm sorry

314
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,800
Then suddenly say resign

315
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,480
I'm giving you trouble

316
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,840
No trouble

317
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,760
How are you doing

318
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,160
It's quite good

319
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,520
Just a little busy

320
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,640
What about you

321
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
I'm just busy with the show

322
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,640
Colan

323
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,400
The next time the program is docked,

324
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,760
Can it still be you

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
Peng Xiao said to dock with you

326
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,960
Compare habits

327
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,400
Han Meng has

328
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
I came back from my wedding leave

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,320
She's very nice

330
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,720
It's no problem to dock with her

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
That

332
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,960
Then the next time you record the program,

333
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,040
Can you come along

334
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,640
In case Yu Hao is a demon again

335
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
Only you can hold him down

336
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
Can't

337
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,800
My mother is in the hospital today

338
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
I forgot my medicine

339
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
Jin Dao helped to send it back

340
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
He forgot his cell phone

341
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,400
I'll take it off for him

342
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,120
Understand

343
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,560
That's really troublesome to you, Jin Dao

344
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,200
I made a special trip

345
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,200
Sue's mother is Colan

346
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
The most important person

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,720
Of course I have to make a special trip

348
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,640
Unlike you

349
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,320
What do you think of only yourself

350
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,480
Jin Dao

351
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,280
Thank you so much today

352
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,240
Some other day my mom and I

353
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,560
Invite you to dinner together

354
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Then let's go first

355
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,400
Let's go

356
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Sure

357
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,800
Goodbye, Jin Dao

358
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,520
Upper

359
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,600
Follow up

360
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,040
Head-on confrontation

361
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,240
Yu Hao eats with Su's mother

362
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,120
It must be awkward

363
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,680
You definitely win this round

364
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,160
Diamond

365
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,240
You're all bored

366
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,120
I made myself so boring

367
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,680
It's not for your happiness

368
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,600
And I'm to blame

369
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
You're talking like you're

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,080
Don't want to poach

371
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Open the door

372
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,320
Jin Xuan

373
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,200
Jin Xuan

374
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Asshole

375
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Let's eat

376
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,760
I'll do it

377
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,000
Nothing

378
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,760
I'll do it

379
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,200
Sit down

380
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,960
Mom eats

381
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,480
Don't mention it

382
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,600
They are all home-cooked dishes

383
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,360
Come

384
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,240
Aunt

385
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
Mom eats meat

386
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,840
Mom has soup

387
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
The soup is delicious

388
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
Drink more if it tastes good

389
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,800
Mom

390
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,840
Aunt

391
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,480
Is this tofu

392
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
It's tofu

393
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,520
I said it looked like

394
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,880
I didn't expect you to be so bad at chatting

395
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,120
There is really no Jin Xuan to talk about

396
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
When are you going to

397
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,080
Invite them to dinner at home

398
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,240
Be angry

399
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,200
No

400
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,720
Be jealous

401
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,880
Not bad

402
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,400
All right

403
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,120
I'll teach you to chat

404
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,560
Next program

405
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,360
What are you going to cook

406
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,800
Go back to my house

407
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,320
I taught you how to do it with my mother

408
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,960
Good or not

409
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,800
Next program

410
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,160
Not going

411
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,080
Well done

412
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,240
Why don't you go

413
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't know what to say

414
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Nothing

415
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,040
I'll draw up the copy for you

416
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,360
Don't you help me draw up

417
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,240
I don't want that Jin Xuan

418
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,360
Another chance to haunt you

419
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,320
Talk about work well

420
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
How did you become a love brain

421
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Colan

422
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,520
Seriously

423
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,560
I'm not saying

424
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,280
Don't want to be in your life

425
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,800
It's just

426
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,560
I may really need it

427
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,640
A little time to get used to it

428
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,160
I can see it

429
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Nothing

430
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,840
Two people together anyway

431
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,080
Always learn to accommodate each other

432
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,520
Then we

433
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,760
Just slowly try to find the rhythm

434
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,240
Don't stop because

435
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,160
Who accommodates whose problems

436
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
And angry

437
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,040
Good or not

438
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,160
That's not true

439
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,440
Why is it wrong

440
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,360
You were the first to be angry today

441
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,160
Don't forget

442
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,520
All right

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,800
That

444
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
Who will be punished in the future

445
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,800
How to punish

446
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,640
How to punish

447
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,320
Then

448
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,440
Give each other a kiss

449
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,040
Is there enough penalty

450
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,200
No

451
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
Divorce

452
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
What's the situation, sister

453
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,920
Earnest

454
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,600
How to go for a tour

455
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,080
I got divorced when I came back.

456
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,080
What the hell have you done

457
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,200
How do you do

458
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,680
Please help me maintain it

459
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,600
All right, this way, please

460
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,000
Wife

461
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
I'm not happy to go home

462
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,840
Haven't had enough fun

463
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,760
Forgot a bunch of things

464
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,040
And lost

465
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,600
Do you dare to be more reliable

466
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,040
But look at that

467
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,200
If it weren't for

468
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
We're cornered

469
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,400
Get stuck on the road

470
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,640
How can you meet herders

471
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,960
Start a period with them

472
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,480
True free travel

473
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,760
This kind of relationship with local people

474
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
Surprise journey of living together

475
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,160
Is it better than making a plan

476
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,120
More interesting

477
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,240
I also got it made by hand

478
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
A polished bracelet

479
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,160
Isn't it beautiful

480
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,800
As good-looking as you

481
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,240
Where's your ring

482
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,720
You're not

483
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Have long taken a fancy to others

484
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,520
Is this bracelet gone

485
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,240
When people started,

486
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
I didn't want to give it

487
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,920
The night before I came back

488
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,280
Drinking with others

489
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,080
People agreed to change it

490
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,280
Don't worry

491
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,120
I was going to

492
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,040
At dawn tomorrow

493
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,400
Just buy a new ring

494
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,520
Make sure it's exactly the same as before

495
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,640
Mengmeng

496
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,080
Mengmeng

497
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,680
That's why you're getting a divorce

498
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,040
You still laugh at me

499
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200
Can you send a circle of friends

500
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,920
Laugh

501
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
You can still laugh

502
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,920
What happened between you and Sucron

503
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,000
How can I help you

504
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,920
Now your uncle and I are divorced

505
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,200
You're laughing right here

506
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,240
She said leave

507
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
If you don't agree, it's over

508
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,280
Then get married

509
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,640
It's a matter for two people

510
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,480
I also have a good temper

511
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,000
I coaxed and comforted all the way

512
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,680
She's getting too far

513
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,720
Leave just leave

514
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,800
Who is afraid of who

515
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,760
According to your temper

516
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
I guess it won't be a few days

517
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,680
You will go on your knees and beg for a remarriage

518
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,880
You two haven't had a few days

519
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm sure I'll get my license again

520
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,600
Absolutely impossible

521
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
How can you put a wedding ring

522
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,560
What about replacing this kind of thing

523
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,440
I really have a crush on it

524
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,760
Do you have that broken bracelet

525
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,160
I can't believe he traded his wedding ring for it

526
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,920
It's just a ring

527
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,280
Buy an identical one

528
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
It would be nice if you didn't

529
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,880
This

530
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,040
This is telling me about divorce

531
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,880
Do you know what angry words are

532
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
As soon as I talk about divorce,

533
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
He was unequivocal

534
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,960
I agreed

535
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,280
How did he put his wedding ring

536
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,680
It's changed

537
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,800
Colan

538
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,600
Mom

539
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,200
How's Mengmeng

540
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,680
Fell asleep

541
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,280
She didn't put the divorce

542
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,960
Tell her parents

543
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,760
Should still want to get back together

544
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,160
You are now

545
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,400
Are you going to discuss with Yu Hao

546
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,240
Then after you

547
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,320
I also plan to run at both ends all the time

548
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,400
After you

549
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,120
That's what I'm going to do

550
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,360
Have you been running at both ends

551
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
You are in this state

552
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,640
Will he be dissatisfied

553
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,400
If he dares to be dissatisfied

554
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,280
Then I don't want him

555
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,480
All right

556
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,960
What happens in the marketing department in the future

557
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,200
Go straight to Su Zong

558
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,680
Why are you in the office again

559
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,760
Is this home occupied by Gong Wenxing

560
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,400
I think they are just angry

561
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
Mengmeng didn't take the divorce

562
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,680
Tell his parents

563
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,120
Gong Wenxing's end

564
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,880
Didn't you tell his mother either

565
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,280
That

566
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
Make an appointment

567
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,360
Let them talk

568
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,800
I feel like meeting

569
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Let's talk

570
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,440
It should be all right

571
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,640
Good

572
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,320
Is there anything else you can do

573
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,560
If it's all right, I'll just

574
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,560
Go home

575
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,960
Your mother

576
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,160
Are you unhappy?

577
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,160
My mother

578
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,920
Your mother must be upset

579
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,440
Your reflex arc is too long

580
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,480
Now I think of my mother

581
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
But I really didn't expect it

582
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,320
You can chat like this

583
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,200
Chatting days should be

584
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
What are you talking about

585
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,360
Chatting at home

586
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,120
Were you at home before

587
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,360
Don't talk about it

588
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm sorry

589
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,960
When my mother was still here,

590
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,400
It's all about my dad's job

591
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,200
And then my mom left

592
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,240
Grandma always felt that

593
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
It's my dad's responsibility

594
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,640
I won't let him see me

595
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,840
From that time on

596
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,520
I've been talking to Gong Wenxing

597
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,640
Live with Grandma

598
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,400
Maybe because at that time

599
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,280
Young

600
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,440
Don't dare to speak

601
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,600
I'm also afraid of saying the wrong thing

602
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,680
You said in case I said something wrong

603
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,600
Make them unhappy

604
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,560
How embarrassed I am

605
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,520
Maybe it's because of this

606
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,360
That led me to now

607
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,240
Not very good at chatting, are you

608
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,640
So you

609
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Since then

610
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,560
Haven't seen your dad since

611
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,520
In the first grade of junior high school

612
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,160
At the school gate

613
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
He came to me

614
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
It was my birthday

615
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,600
He gave me a pair of shoes

616
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,280
But my grandmother lost it

617
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,640
Since then

618
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,680
I haven't seen it before

619
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,720
So you hate your dad

620
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,520
Think it's because of him

621
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,160
Your mother just

622
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,240
It can't be said to be annoying

623
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,840
Then why don't you see him

624
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,520
See him

625
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't know what to say

626
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,240
You can't talk

627
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
Afraid of embarrassment

628
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,240
And I'll hold you

629
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,080
Have dinner with my mother

630
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,640
Nothing

631
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,080
I learn slowly

632
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,520
I was so embarrassed at the dinner table just now

633
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,680
Aren't you full

634
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,400
Then I'll make you something delicious

635
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,440
Good or not

636
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,680
Thank you

637
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
Sweet

638
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
Why is it sweet

639
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,200
It's sweet

640
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,000
You haven't eaten anything sweet

641
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,480
Bean curd should not be salty

642
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,640
Or is it spicy

643
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,920
And spicy

644
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,920
This Chongqing people eat spicy food

645
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,960
Isn't that normal

646
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,640
Then you can't put everything spicy, can you

647
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,000
Do you eat a brown sugar cake

648
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,960
You put it spicy, too

649
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,920
There is some point in saying it

650
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
Bean curd, it's not a sweet

651
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,600
But there is sweet bean curd

652
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
I don't want to blame you

653
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,560
Make food software

654
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
Why are you so ignorant

655
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,160
Knowing and accepting are two different things

656
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,280
Don't you think

657
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,040
What we just talked about

658
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,440
Especially without nutrition

659
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,720
But is it interesting

660
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,920
How interesting

661
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,800
My dad used to tell me

662
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
Food is opening the conversation

663
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,520
The best way

664
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,400
He said that no matter the north or south,

665
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,280
How big is the dietary difference

666
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,080
Everyone greets each other

667
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,120
The ways are

668
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,920
Did you eat

669
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,760
There is culture in food

670
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,480
Personality

671
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
And growing up experience and so on

672
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,360
Is to know a person

673
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,840
The best opportunity

674
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,960
When you are curious and concerned,

675
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,160
It's not that hard to chat

676
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,360
Sweet bean curd

677
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,320
Is it delicious

678
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,920
It's still a little weird

679
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,560
Be full

680
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,680
Stay and work overtime tonight

681
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
You

682
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,120
Don't you think

683
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,280
If someone suddenly comes to work overtime,

684
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
No one will come

685
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,080
He can't get in when he comes

686
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,040
I turned off the electronic lock

687
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Work overtime

688
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,400
Don't

689
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,080
To

690
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,160
Don't

691
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,560
To

692
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,080
Don't

693
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,400
Hello

694
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,480
Zhao Zong

695
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,080
Yu Hao

696
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,840
Zhao Zong said next week

697
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,160
I'm going to come over

698
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,760
Work overtime

699
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,840
The cell phone rang

700
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,040
Don't you answer the phone when you work overtime

701
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,720
Mr. Han came back from his honeymoon

702
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,240
Yeah

703
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,160
Dark circles are so heavy

704
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,600
Work pressure has been so great recently

705
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,120
He

706
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,000
I went back to the company to pick up the documents last night

707
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,760
I don't know what happened

708
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,960
Locked in the company

709
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,160
Don't say last night

710
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,120
What happened

711
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,520
My one

712
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
Last night

713
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,440
Work overtime in the office

714
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,720
I don't know why

715
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,600
I was locked in my office

716
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,320
It's rare for Yu to say

717
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,760
No overtime tonight

718
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,520
What are you doing back at the company

719
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I still have something to finish here

720
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
I'm afraid I'll be scolded tomorrow if I can't finish it.

721
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,640
Good

722
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,320
See you later

723
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,160
All right

724
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,240
I don't know how to put it

725
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,280
You last night

726
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,640
It's really locked in the company

727
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,280
Where did my medlar go

728
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,640
Yu Zong

729
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,600
Colan didn't come home last night either

730
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,920
I remember your family

731
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,040
Is it also occupied by someone

732
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,280
Yao Qian

733
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,800
The theme of next week's program

734
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,160
You check with the program group

735
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,360
Okay, Sister Kelan

736
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,920
Mr. Su last night

737
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,760
I made it up

738
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,600
Details of advertising shooting

739
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,360
Do you want to check it

740
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,840
Check it, Mr. Su

741
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,440
You run to the office

742
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,920
He also locked the door

743
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,960
You two just sit opposite each other

744
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,560
Work together

745
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,360
Really good

746
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
You think you two are high school students

747
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,080
I'm studying for the college entrance examination here

748
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,000
I worked all night and looked at my cell phone

749
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,480
A moment in spring night

750
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,800
It was wasted by you like this

751
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,480
Or say

752
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,160
You hate the office

753
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,200
I can't let go of my hands and feet

754
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,960
What are you talking about?

755
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,880
The one from the technical department

756
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,680
Interns with black-rimmed glasses

757
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,000
You know, right

758
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,320
People also spent the night yesterday

759
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,560
It's in the office

760
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,320
Say it or not

761
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,200
There are witnesses

762
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,560
Are you two really apart from work

763
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,720
Didn't do anything

764
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,120
It's not dry at all

765
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,280
It didn't dry at all

766
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,280
Honestly confess

767
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,360
Hurry up, hurry up

768
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,440
Mr. Sue, I'm free now

769
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,200
I reported to you about the marketing department

770
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,000
Is Sue always listening

771
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,160
Su Zong

772
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,720
Give me ten minutes

773
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,960
Su Zong

774
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,560
Is it convenient

775
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,040
Then let's take another time

776
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,000
Good

777
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,800
No problem

778
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,760
I'm listening

779
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,520
Good

780
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,000
Su Zong

781
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Just a moment, please

782
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,600
Sure

783
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,840
Then you tell me first

784
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,520
What adjustments are there

785
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,960
I'll let Yao Qian

786
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,000
Follow-up

787
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,600
Yao Qian, communicate directly

788
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,320
Row

789
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,000
That's it

790
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,480
How many people come altogether

791
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,760
When will the plan come out

792
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,600
Good

793
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,200
Are there any questions

794
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,840
This is right

795
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,600
Yes

796
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,360
Right, right, right

797
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,840
All right

798
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,080
You have a problem

799
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,280
Call me anytime

800
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
The contract amount is all wrong

801
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,360
Why did you send it to me?

802
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,520
Can you pour me a cup of coffee

803
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,440
Su Kelan, you are really good

804
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,160
I brought my wash bag with me

805
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,040
You don't do anything

806
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,920
Keep your voice down

807
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:04,960
Really

808
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,560
Coming, coming

809
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:07,880
Quickly

810
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,800
Get off work early today

811
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,240
Eat dinner with your mother

812
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,600
Come to my house

813
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,040
Come to my house

814
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,600
What are you doing

815
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,200
Quick back

816
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,680
Look at it. Come on, come on

817
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,800
Let me give it to you again

818
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,920
Make coffee as an assistant

819
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,520
It's awkward

820
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,400
Didn't you start the meeting

821
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,800
You still blame somebody else

822
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,120
Then I drove it for him, too

823
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,800
Let me be promoted to vice president for no reason

824
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,320
Make Lao Wang unhappy

825
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:40,920
Just deliberately pick the time

826
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,560
Call me in the middle of the night

827
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,200
If I don't answer it,

828
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,560
He's even more upset with me

829
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,600
Then you take the attitude of vice president

830
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,000
Let him accommodate your work

831
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,360
I didn't promise Yu Hao to be the vice president

832
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,000
Ah

833
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,960
That's what bothers you

834
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,240
I still think what happened

835
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,680
So most of these people

836
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,200
Everyone wants a promotion and a raise

837
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,760
You're the only one here

838
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,720
And Versailles with me

839
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,600
No

840
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,680
The situation of my family, you

841
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,120
It's not like you don't know

842
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,880
He is not in the company now to correct it.

843
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,200
Talk to him again

844
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,280
I guess he will be unhappy again

845
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,920
I think

846
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,240
It's normal for him to be unhappy

847
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,920
It means he cares about you

848
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,120
Look at that

849
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,640
What about most men

850
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,400
I can't wait for my wife

851
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,360
What about staying at home full time

852
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,320
He gave you a promotion

853
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,480
One is hope

854
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,240
Have more time

855
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,640
To be with you

856
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,200
More importantly,

857
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,760
Show that he trusts you

858
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,120
Recognize you

859
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,640
I know

860
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,360
But my mother

861
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,440
Colan

862
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,400
This may come to say

863
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,760
It doesn't sound very nice

864
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,800
But think about it carefully

865
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,840
In your longest future life

866
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,640
Can accompany you to the end

867
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,760
That man

868
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,440
Who is it

869
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,080
Ever since your family

870
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,760
What about after what happened

871
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,120
Whether it's love or life,

872
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,400
You've been around all the time

873
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,080
Your mother turns

874
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,760
Completely without yourself

875
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,680
What about this matter

876
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,800
Yu Hao didn't discuss with you

877
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,160
That's really what he did wrong

878
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,880
But if you think about it,

879
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,520
This job

880
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,400
For yourself,

881
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,400
What's more important is that

882
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,320
What is its value and significance

883
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,240
Mengmeng

884
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,800
Don't forget to make an appointment today

885
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,760
Have dinner together

886
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,520
I also plan to make a fuss

887
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,240
Stay at my house for a few days

888
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,320
I think I'm taking up your time

889
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,440
Change the subject

890
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,840
Can you solve the problem

891
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,000
Aren't you changing the subject, too

892
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,480
No matter, no matter

893
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,400
Anyway, I'm tired of looking at him now

894
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,160
It is impossible for me to take the initiative to find him

895
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,000
The most boring thing about people is to be angry

896
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,600
You also think I said divorce

897
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,720
Just angry

898
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,360
Then let me ask you something

899
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,520
If it were you

900
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,280
You will take the wedding ring

901
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,840
Go get another one

902
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,280
Something that doesn't matter

903
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,920
He brought me a wedding ring

904
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,360
The moment you look at me

905
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,000
I seem to see his future

906
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,520
A life entrusted to me

907
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,320
And I put the ring on

908
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,640
When he has it,

909
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,960
The same

910
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,160
I put all my promises

911
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,440
And live up to

912
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,360
It all turns into this

913
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,520
A small ring

914
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,200
Always stay at his fingertips

915
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,920
But what about him

916
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,600
He not only casually

917
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,720
Just replace it

918
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,360
Even why am I unhappy

919
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,480
He doesn't even know

920
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,720
I'm sad

921
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,280
It was he who took my sadness

922
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,600
As a joke

923
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,040
You didn't come back all night yesterday

924
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,600
This will be my lodging fee

925
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,280
Uncle wishes you to make persistent efforts

926
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,680
Bravely create brilliant achievements

927
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,680
Han Meng is downstairs now

928
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,440
She talks to Su Kelan every day

929
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,600
Go downstairs for coffee

930
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,480
Who said I was looking for her

931
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,240
It's not that you apologize if you want to

932
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,120
Coax if you want

933
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,280
Can you leave me alone in my work

934
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,880
It still depends on my family

935
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,240
Take up my personal space

936
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,000
Big Brother

937
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,320
Call Uncle

938
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,040
I used to live under the same roof

939
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,520
I didn't see you. You're not used to it

940
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,760
Why not now

941
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,960
I understand you

942
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,040
Home is so boring

943
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,160
How exciting the office is

944
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,400
Is there something wrong with it

945
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,480
Are you idle and have nothing to do

946
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,640
How do you talk to your uncle

947
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,280
Give me back

948
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,760
Don't don't

949
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,600
Haohao, why are you like this

950
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,760
Don't don't

951
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,240
I'm telling you

952
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,400
You gotta go, gotta go

953
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,000
Go quickly

954
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,200
If you don't leave, I'll call security

955
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,000
You said

956
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,640
I changed my wedding ring

957
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,880
Is it too much

958
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,560
Then you should ask her

959
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,560
Why are you asking me

960
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,800
You are more reasonable

961
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,720
When did feelings make sense

962
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,560
Besides

963
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,280
Even if it's reasonable

964
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,640
This wedding ring is for the two of you

965
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,880
Jointly owned

966
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,560
You shouldn't be presumptuous

967
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,760
Go home early at night

968
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,960
I'll have dinner together

969
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,240
I can tell you what

970
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,320
If you don't leave,

971
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,920
Han Meng will come back to work soon

972
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,560
It's not like I didn't apologize

973
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,520
No mistake

974
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,480
Not coaxed

975
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,200
It's just a ring

976
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,640
Doesn't anyone matter yet

977
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,240
Always talk about divorce

978
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,440
It's her fault, isn't it

979
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,120
So

980
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,520
It was I who made trouble without reason

981
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,480
You've been putting up with me

982
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,920
You're innocent

983
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,040
Enough now, right

984
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,840
Mengmeng

985
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,800
You don't even care

986
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,800
What am I keeping it for

987
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,640
Mengmeng

988
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,360
Su Zong

989
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,080
Mr. Li of CICC will arrive soon

990
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,560
Mr. Li

991
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,720
I will confirm the law firm in the near future

992
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,160
And accounting firm

993
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,040
What are the compliance risks

994
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,360
Avoid in advance first

995
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
It's very thoughtful

996
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:16,680
That's right

997
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,480
Are you guys

998
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,520
Promotion in the next stage

999
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,880
To sign Diamond's endorsement

1000
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,000
Diamond endorsement

1001
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,640
Yeah

1002
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,000
Lao Wang's side is not

1003
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,240
Has been with Diamond Brokerage Company

1004
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,920
Are we talking

1005
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,920
And Diamond's company

1006
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,120
Have you communicated yet

1007
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,520
It has been settled

1008
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,560
Did the other party mention anything

1009
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,240
Mr. Wang

1010
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,400
Excuse me for interrupting

1011
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,240
Is it convenient for Mr. Wang to have a word

1012
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,120
One thing

1013
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,720
I need to confirm with you

1014
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,960
Su Zong

1015
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,840
If it's a work thing,

1016
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,600
Say it right here

1017
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,880
Are you going to let Diamond speak for you

1018
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,040
This thing, ah

1019
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,800
That's right

1020
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,760
We have talked with the other company

1021
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,480
It's been communicated

1022
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,560
What are you dissatisfied with

1023
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,400
Place

1024
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,600
The company introduced a new spokesperson

1025
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,560
No problem

1026
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,520
But Diamond

1027
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,600
And "what to eat next"

1028
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,480
Inconsistency of endorsement tonality

1029
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,320
Look at me

1030
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,600
Forget this crop

1031
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,800
Colan

1032
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,200
You're Mr. Yu's girlfriend

1033
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,080
I must mind in my heart

1034
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,000
But taking a private position

1035
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,320
And emotions to work

1036
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,800
Will seriously affect the judgment of work

1037
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,120
What do you say

1038
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,800
Mr. Wang

1039
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,960
Potential buyers of the company

1040
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,440
Mainly female

1041
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,040
Have you ever thought about

1042
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,120
They have Diamond

1043
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,440
Acceptance

1044
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,040
When the time comes, if they are not satisfied,

1045
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,400
What to do

1046
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,560
Will it affect the sales volume

1047
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,040
This matter

1048
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,040
I hope you can give up as soon as possible

1049
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,160
For the sake of safeguarding the interests of the company

1050
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,600
My side will not agree

1051
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,120
Is it Diamond's contract

1052
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,560
It's already here with you

1053
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,120
Hold it for me first

1054
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,960
Thank you

1055
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,840
Heard

1056
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,720
Mr. Wang is face to face

1057
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,920
Was killed by Su Kelan

1058
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,640
Have you heard about it

1059
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,520
Mr. Wang asked Diamond to speak for him

1060
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,560
Is it true or not

1061
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,800
So exciting

1062
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,000
No wonder Sister Kelan just now

1063
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,360
Went to the marketing department

1064
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,760
You don't know

1065
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,200
Just now, Sister Kelan can talk directly

1066
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,960
I won't pass this plan

1067
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,680
But Sister Lan still has this

1068
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,840
The tough side

1069
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,600
Who can bear this

1070
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,360
If my husband is like this,

1071
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,800
I can't possibly agree

1072
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,040
If I were you

1073
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,800
Just report to Mr. Yu directly

1074
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,280
Do you still need to tear it off by yourself

1075
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,240
You said Diamond spoke for me

1076
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,840
Is it Yu Zong's meaning

1077
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,160
It's not that you guys are talking nonsense

1078
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,760
Proceed from the interests of the company

1079
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,520
Diamond endorsement is really inappropriate

1080
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,280
I think Sister Colan

1081
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,200
It makes sense

1082
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,400
If this thing

1083
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,960
She asked Yu Zong to come forward to solve it

1084
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,080
It will only make people think that it is

1085
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,800
Sister Ke Lan has a problem with her ability to work

1086
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,720
Even at this time

1087
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,120
Yu always came out against it

1088
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,200
It also makes people think that

1089
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,400
It's Sister Kelan who blows the wind

1090
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,360
I don't know anything day by day

1091
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,400
Have lunch together later

1092
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,720
No, I'm worried about Mengmeng

1093
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,160
I'll go find her

1094
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,760
Maybe I have to accompany her today

1095
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,040
Yu Zongsu is always busy

1096
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,880
Some replies may be slow

1097
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,960
It will affect the work of the marketing department

1098
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,760
Can Mr. Yu give a personal reply

1099
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,560
Is Wang Yi embarrassing you

1100
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,680
Yu Zong

1101
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,880
There is a problem with the technology

1102
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,840
Do you have time to have a meeting together

1103
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,400
Good

1104
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,000
Where are you? Are you all right

1105
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,640
Hello Yao Qian

1106
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,200
Hello, Sister Colan

1107
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,120
No, it's bad. Something happened

1108
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,280
About Diamond's endorsement

1109
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,400
It was leaked out

1110
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,520
I told you to leave me alone

1111
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,840
Yu Zong, look at me like this

1112
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,440
Which is more suitable for endorsement

1113
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,160
What if he says he likes it all

1114
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,000
What for

1115
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,480
I'm busy. Don't bother me

1116
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,320
Sister, you didn't look at your cell phone

1117
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,720
Then don't look

1118
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,560
Hello

1119
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,560
Hello

1120
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,800
I heard it was Diamond

1121
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,240
Always wanted to speak for "what to eat"

1122
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,200
Then she is not suitable

1123
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,040
Image temperament is a long story

1124
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:06,920
Really inappropriate

1125
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,040
Yao Qian

1126
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,560
Didn't you agree with Diamond's endorsement

1127
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,640
How did it get out

1128
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,680
It must be the news from Mr. Wang

1129
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,760
Want to push Diamond

1130
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,600
Put pressure on Sister Colan

1131
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,640
Do you think he is stupid

1132
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,720
Hello Sister Meng

1133
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,640
Something happened

1134
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,920
Mr. Wang

1135
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,880
Really don't let advertising companies

1136
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,920
Change the scheme

1137
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,800
Sue always said she wouldn't

1138
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,920
Agreed to let Diamond speak for him

1139
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,960
Let you know the news

1140
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,800
Tell the media

1141
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,320
Talking about endorsement

1142
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,400
Is it thorough

1143
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,760
Thoroughly

1144
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,560
If she doesn't agree

1145
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,280
Let herself and Diamond

1146
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,560
Explain when the bad guys go

1147
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,320
Su Kelan's people

1148
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,120
There must be no good

1149
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,720
Hello, the number you dialed

1150
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,440
You're out of your mind

1151
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,520
Thought to get out of this matter

1152
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
The media will support you and force Su Kelan

1153
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,400
Agree to endorse

1154
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:35,800
Look at the present

1155
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,200
Are they all talking about

1156
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,960
Diamond is not suitable

1157
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,400
What a big deal

1158
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,120
Doesn't this also increase the attention

1159
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,800
I'll avoid it first

1160
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,880
Now Su Kelan

1161
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,200
If you don't promise, you have to promise

1162
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,800
Wang Yi Pig

1163
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,920
Don't come in for the meeting

1164
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,520
Yao Qian

1165
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,760
You go straight to the marketing department to find him

1166
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,000
People in the marketing department claim to be

1167
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,200
Meeting with an advertising agency

1168
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,560
The media calls are ringing off the hook

1169
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,400
I didn't answer any of them

1170
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,240
But if you don't reply,

1171
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,600
It's bound to cause controversy

1172
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,360
When the time comes, the reputation of the company

1173
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,200
It's not good either

1174
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,400
Clarify

1175
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,840
Say there is no endorsement

1176
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,000
Diamond Company

1177
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,640
Let that fool go by himself

1178
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,680
Clean up a mess

1179
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,560
Mr. Wang

1180
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,680
Look at the news in the group

1181
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:46,920
Mr. Wang

1182
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,200
You don't deal with the media

1183
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,120
Don't understand

1184
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,760
This is not the first time

1185
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,080
Properly handle the clarification

1186
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,520
It will lead to escalation of contradictions

1187
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,160
Rival companies will also fan the flames

1188
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,640
Say "what to eat" and leak the news

1189
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,440
Have no credibility

1190
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,840
Yao Qian, if now, immediately

1191
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,120
Clarify that Diamond was not asked to speak for him

1192
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,680
Others will make excuses

1193
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,040
Attack our company

1194
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,160
It will be fine if it is fast

1195
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,440
And if it is clarified,

1196
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,720
I can't find an excuse to make trouble

1197
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,080
But Diamond's end

1198
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,040
It must be hard

1199
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,080
Because all this time

1200
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,520
There are brands that say she is native

1201
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,520
This clarification

1202
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,200
Repeat one's hand

1203
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,440
Discuss what

1204
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,520
It's nothing more than saying

1205
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,760
Didn't speak for this matter

1206
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,560
Say it's me

1207
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,520
Make your own decisions

1208
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,040
These people

1209
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,120
I can't wait to see my joke

1210
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:38,720
Mengmeng

1211
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,560
You go and find Mr. Wang later

1212
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,160
Implement the advertising plan

1213
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,600
Let Diamond participate

1214
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,040
You have to agree to endorse it

1215
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,400
No

1216
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,200
In this way

1217
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,200
Yao Qian

1218
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,840
You're going to talk to the press later

1219
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,880
There are two more people

1220
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,280
Take air separately

1221
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,480
Just say two people have been

1222
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,720
They are all very good friends

1223
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,640
So our company

1224
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,000
There is an advertisement

1225
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,040
Mr. Yu invited Diamond to play in friendship

1226
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,840
The result was misinformed as an endorsement

1227
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,000
What's the matter? Is there a problem

1228
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,120
No

1229
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:06,880
In that case

1230
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,000
It is true that on both sides

1231
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,280
There will be no more problems

1232
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,720
But

1233
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,560
Why do you want to give Wang Yi a step down

1234
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,000
This is his pot

1235
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,040
It's all one company

1236
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,200
Divide what yours and mine

1237
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,120
What he said

1238
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,440
On behalf of the company

1239
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,400
Something happened and pushed him out

1240
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,600
It doesn't make people feel that

1241
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,080
Is the management of the company chaotic

1242
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,880
Sister Kelan

1243
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,800
Is it right now to communicate

1244
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,000
Or wait for you and Diamond

1245
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,600
I'll talk about it after I have communicated at both ends

1246
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,360
Don't wait

1247
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,200
A scolded person

1248
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,520
It must be hard now

1249
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,960
And it took a long time

1250
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,160
If you clarify again,

1251
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,360
The credibility is also insufficient

1252
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,520
Let's do it now

1253
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,560
Good

1254
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,120
Elder sister

1255
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,680
I see you simply because

1256
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,080
Look at Diamond being scolded. It's too pitiful

1257
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,240
At this time

1258
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,800
Why are you still thinking about her

1259
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,480
Our own infighting

1260
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,040
Be scolded for implicating others as chips

1261
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,200
What's going on

1262
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,040
Then look at them

1263
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:15,960
Shoot advertisements together

1264
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,560
Do you feel at ease

1265
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,760
Elder sister

1266
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,720
Someone who needs to be so defensive

1267
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,040
Then I don't want it

1268
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,840
Completely defenseless

1269
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,240
Or the heart is too big

1270
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,600
Or people are too nice

1271
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,680
If you believe

1272
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,000
It's because people are too nice

1273
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,440
Does the good man think

1274
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,760
Your heart is too big

1275
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,000
If we say

1276
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,960
Good people don't think you are too big-hearted

1277
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,360
Then do you think

1278
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,520
Good people's hearts are too big

1279
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,120
What tongue twisters are you talking about

1280
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,320
It's too complicated for me to understand

1281
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,360
Just play dumb for me

1282
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,760
Then the head is the way

1283
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,560
How are you

1284
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,880
I'm I'm okay

1285
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,200
Where are you

1286
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,600
Send me a location

1287
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,440
I came to see you

1288
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,880
Jin Dao

1289
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,640
I'm sorry

1290
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,640
There's something I'd like to ask you for

1291
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,640
Advertising Diamond's Role

1292
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,560
Deal with as friends

1293
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,160
Don't give any hint of a couple

1294
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,400
Otherwise, it will definitely fry the pan

1295
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,640
It's going to blow up again

1296
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,480
We're not responsible for cleaning up the mess

1297
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,560
Sorry for the subscriber you dialed

1298
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,960
Unable to connect temporarily

1299
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,920
Please dial again later

1300
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,960
Don't you bother me

1301
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,160
Why are you bothering me

1302
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,440
Do you see my jokes

1303
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,760
No

1304
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,600
I think it's appropriate, too

1305
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,760
That's settled then

1306
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:00,760
Bye bye

1307
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,080
I'm with Mengmeng tonight

1308
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,240
OK
