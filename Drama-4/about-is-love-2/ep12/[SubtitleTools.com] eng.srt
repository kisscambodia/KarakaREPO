18
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,190
I ended up sleeping in these clothes.

19
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,270
Did I even drink that much last night?

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,390
How did this get here?

21
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,190
(What are you up to dressing like this?)

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,390
Are you asking me?

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
Didn't you get me this dress?

24
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,160
Tell me.

25
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,470
Whose dress is this?

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,440
It's...

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Did I imagine all that?

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,875
(Zhou Shi)

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,475
(Li Mingcheng)

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,190
Li Mingcheng,

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm not going in today.

32
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,190
You and Wei An will manage
the company for today.

33
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,110
Yes, Mr. Wei.

34
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,550
Do you need any help?

35
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,440
Nothing. Just get to work.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,880
Don't call me if it's nothing serious.

37
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,960
Pei.

38
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,830
Yes, Ms. Zhou.

39
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,390
Please revise this part

40
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,630
according to my comments

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,880
and get Ms. Xue to sign this.
Understand?

42
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,630
Ms. Zhou,

43
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,600
someone wants to meet you,
but he doesn't have an appointment.

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,470
Who is it?

45
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,670
Wei Qing.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,110
So are you planning

47
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,000
to work at Shangjue now?

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah.

49
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,030
What about Yunma?

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,360
Li Mingcheng and Wei An
can take care of it.

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,910
But as you can see,

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,360
my office is not that big.

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,190
I have no extra space
to accommodate you.

54
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,030
I think this is good enough for me.

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,600
Let's make do with this.

56
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,960
Pei.

57
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,110
Ms. Zhou, what is it?

58
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,000
Get two people to move a desk in here.

59
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,080
Sure.

60
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,960
Mr. Wei, please wait.
Your desk will be here soon.

61
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,670
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,240
Well,

63
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,030
when did you leave last night?

64
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,720
I left after my clothes were dry.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,760
What was I doing when you left?

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,000
You had too much drink
and you were sleeping.

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,110
Sleeping?

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,790
Ms. Zhou, where should I put this?

69
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,920
Bring it to Mr. Wei.

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,510
You can leave now.

71
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,270
So? Is this desk

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
suitable for you?

73
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,270
Yes, it is.

74
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,480
I get to see you just right.

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,230
Then enjoy yourself.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,510
I'm getting back to work.

77
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,390
(Are you trying to upset me?)

78
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,550
(I'm not going to let you get your way.)

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,110
(When are we going to start doing yoga?)

80
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,720
Pick the one that you like first.

81
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
Wearing this is enough.

82
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,920
Let's begin. How do we do it?

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
Then come with me.

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,070
(If you dare to have any dirty ideas,)

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,670
(I'm going to show you)

86
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,230
(what an unreasonable ex-girlfriend
is like.)

87
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,350
Come here.

88
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,480
Okay.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Let's begin.

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,550
Begin what?

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,200
Head massage.

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,350
This is what you meant?

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,760
Why do you talk so much today?

94
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,320
Start massaging already.

95
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,760
You're not doing it right. Do it harder.

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
What's wrong?

97
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,760
Am I not doing it right again?

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,830
How nice would it be

99
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,480
if you were her.

100
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,070
Do you want Zhou Shi
to massage it for you?

101
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,510
No.

102
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,480
It's enough for me
as long as she can stay by my side

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,440
and let me see her every day.

104
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,200
I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep now.

105
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,550
Can you leave after I fall asleep?

106
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,440
Okay.

107
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,200
You've seen it?

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,270
He was drunk at the time.

109
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,440
He treated me as if I was someone else.

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,270
He hallucinated another "Zhou Shi".

111
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,480
I shouldn't tell you

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,230
about this matter.

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,790
But given your relationship,

114
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,670
I think you should know about this.

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,440
Wei Qing suffers from
mild hypochondriasis.

116
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,950
Hypochondriasis?

117
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,200
When did that happen?

118
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,760
It was six months after you left.

119
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,270
He began to see

120
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,000
illusions of you

121
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,270
and came to me for treatment.

122
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,390
He has taken the prescriptions I gave
for some time now.

123
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,920
Yet, he didn't get better.

124
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,160
Also, I noticed he's enjoying

125
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,440
these hallucinations.

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,600
But

127
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,720
why did he suddenly end up like this?

128
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,390
It's from lovesick.

129
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,320
But I didn't expect

130
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,880
he'd have an attack

131
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
after you return.

132
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,640
I know I shouldn't ask this.

133
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,350
But are you not

134
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,480
on good terms?

135
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,760
Not at all.

136
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,000
Zhou Shi, you were the one to help him

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,390
with his allergies.

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,110
I'll have to rely on you

139
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,600
to cure his hypochondriasis.

140
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,040
You're his cure.

141
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,600
What should I do?

142
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,070
Do you still like him?

143
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,760
Then keep on loving him.

144
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,670
He'll recover soon.

145
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,200
All done? Let's eat.

146
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,230
I'm not hungry.

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,110
Apart from Wu Zheng,

148
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,230
many works of cutting-edge painters are
to be exhibited for Asian Art Biennial.

149
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
I must finalize the contracts

150
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,950
and their exhibition works.

151
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I need to be at the gallery
before 2 PM

152
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,760
to discuss the layout of the booths.

153
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,350
A huge workload is
all the more reason to eat.

154
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,640
We have one hour.

155
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,640
You can go to the gallery after we eat.

156
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,470
It's all right.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,590
I have this.

158
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,080
This is all you eat every day?

159
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,230
I don't like to have meals anyway.

160
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
Are you kidding me?

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
When I pursued you in the past,

162
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,710
you were indifferent
to everything I gave you.

163
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,230
Except for foods.

164
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,200
So are you telling me

165
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,640
you're not interested in foods now?

166
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,280
People will change, right?

167
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,590
Do you want coffee?

168
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,880
I'll make one for you.

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,940
(Health Care Product)

170
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,840
So this is how you've treated yourself
for the past two years.

171
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,350
Luckily, I'm back.

172
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,840
Sir, would you like to
make your orders now?

173
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm flattered

174
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,320
that you wanted to see me, Mr. Wei.

175
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,910
You can just cut to the chase.

176
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,670
The Snow Group is a family business.

177
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,110
The bloodline is
the most important thing.

178
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,030
You made great contributions to Snow.

179
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,110
But you are an adopted child, after all.

180
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,590
The Snow Group certainly likes you
to make money for them.

181
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,000
But if you were

182
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,470
to take over the company,

183
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,710
I think

184
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,200
many would object to it.

185
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,200
They're more willing

186
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,840
to find a successor
with Snow's bloodline.

187
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,960
When I became a shareholder of Shangjue,

188
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
you didn't object.

189
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,880
That's how I know you don't treat

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Shangjue with high regard.

191
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm guessing this art biennial

192
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,200
is a test from the old folks

193
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,520
set up for Xue Le.

194
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,110
This concerns whether he can inherit
the family business.

195
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,710
You arranged for Zhou Shi
to be part of it

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,080
just to gain my attention,

197
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,150
so I'd get involved in this mess.

198
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,760
You must know

199
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,110
that whether Shangjue can make a name

200
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,590
and gain a foothold

201
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,910
depend

202
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,910
on your attitude, Ms. Xue.

203
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,910
Let me think.

204
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,910
Your condition to help me is...

205
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,670
Zhou Shi.

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,030
I don't care what means you use.

207
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,350
I can give you everything you want.

208
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,880
My condition is...

209
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,150
to let Zhou Shi leave.

210
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,150
I had no idea

211
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,840
you're still obsessed with her.

212
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm a little envious now.

213
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,960
Does that mean

214
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,440
we have an agreement, then?

215
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,350
I trust your insight,

216
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,000
and you'll make the right choice.

217
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,440
What are you doing?

218
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Ms. Zhou,

219
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,320
come and look.

220
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,880
I was only away for a short while.

221
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,150
I don't think you want to dine out.

222
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,550
So I asked them
to buy some food randomly.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,790
Just pick anything you want to eat.

224
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,350
Mr. Wei, can you please fix

225
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
this lofty habit of yours?

226
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,280
You called this high profile?

227
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,200
I don't think they bought enough.
So just dig in.

228
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,470
Pei,

229
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,520
have you eaten?

230
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,670
Not yet.

231
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,280
All of you haven't eaten, right?

232
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,080
Why don't all of you join us?

233
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
Don't just stand there. Thank Mr. Wei.

234
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,760
Thank you, Mr. Wei!

235
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,230
All right. I understand.

236
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,080
I will optimize the questions
you brought up

237
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,320
as soon as possible.

238
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,320
I'll send it to you for confirmation
after improving it.

239
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,230
All right.

240
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,280
Thank you.

241
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,640
Not bad. You're becoming good at it.

242
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,110
When you were my personal assistant,

243
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,320
you didn't even know
how to answer phone calls.

244
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,280
You can take care
of everything yourself now.

245
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,710
Thank you for your compliments.

246
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,030
Thanks to you,
I've built a good foundation

247
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,710
to have such an accomplishment today.

248
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,640
Your great kindness and virtue
are unforgettable.

249
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,470
Can we have sushi now?

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,470
When did you become so ladylike?

251
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,470
You know nothing.
I don't want to ruin my lipstick.

252
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
I'm full.

253
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,280
Have some more.

254
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,670
You didn't eat the whole day.

255
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,000
So do you have any idea
about the venue arrangement

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
of this biennial?

257
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,230
Shangjue is a young company.

258
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,710
So we want to show

259
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,670
our young spirit
in this biennial exhibition.

260
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,960
To highlight something new.

261
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,640
We intend to use
Master Wu Zheng's latest work,

262
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,150
the Aurora series,

263
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,470
as the exhibition's focus.

264
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,590
The Aurora series is indeed

265
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,590
a masterpiece of Wu Zheng's works.

266
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,710
But when it comes to commercial value,

267
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
his Farm Keeper series

268
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,520
have the most commercial value,

269
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,880
which is closer to reality

270
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,200
and more in line
with the current popular realism.

271
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,080
The public is likely to accept it.

272
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,640
I think otherwise.
Farm Keeper series may be a classic.

273
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,350
But it's his early works.

274
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,550
Perhaps, some fans may appreciate it.

275
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,760
But it may not necessarily

276
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,910
attract a new fan base.

277
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,400
Not to mention
Master Wu Zheng isn't going to

278
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,200
transfer the copyrights
of his classic works.

279
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,280
That doesn't matter.

280
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,880
Just tell the publishing house

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,550
to transfer the copyright.

282
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,030
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

283
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,080
It's not that hard either.

284
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,230
It's just about offering

285
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,590
the right conditions, that's all.

286
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,150
It's your first time holding
an exhibition in China.

287
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,880
I have more experience

288
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,200
and I understand the market
more than you do.

289
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,670
Of course, you're more experienced.

290
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,760
But I've held
a few exhibitions overseas too.

291
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,030
They may be small-scale.

292
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,760
But I still have some experience

293
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,230
in how to attract youngsters.

294
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,030
The domestic market environment

295
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,150
is different.

296
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,110
There are only a few
who visit the domestic exhibition.

297
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,200
Aurora series is partial
to stylized art.

298
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,320
It'd be a little hard
for the public to accept it.

299
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,350
So

300
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,280
when people accept new things,

301
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,520
they tend to choose classics
rather than new ones.

302
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,670
You're right, Mr. Wei.

303
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,000
That's why we did

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,110
many data collection from the beginning.

305
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,150
The finding is contrary
to what you've said.

306
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Everyone prefers to see some new works.

307
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,790
After all, anyone can search

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
classic paintings online now.

309
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,230
If it's like what you said,

310
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,400
there won't be so many people lining up

311
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,760
to see the Mona Lisa every year.

312
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,400
They could just search
and view it online.

313
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,230
But they were there
for the fame, not art.

314
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,150
If that's the case,

315
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,880
all the more for you to choose
the Farm Keeper series, then.

316
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,880
Fame and art go together.

317
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,110
Every patron of art can get
what they need this way.

318
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,280
But I've already said

319
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,350
that Master Wu Zheng isn't prepared

320
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,400
to transfer the copyright
of the Farm Keeper series.

321
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,470
There's always a way.

322
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,470
Fine.

323
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,000
We'll discuss this
after you've found the solution.

324
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,470
Before that,

325
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,280
just do it according to my plan.

326
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,400
Please know

327
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,320
that Shangjue is the main organizer,

328
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,840
and Yunma is only the co-organizer
of this exhibition.

329
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,520
So you'll have to

330
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,840
listen to me, Mr. Wei.

331
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,470
Just take care of this matter
according to my plan.

332
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,710
Is there anything else?

333
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,440
You don't look too well.

334
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,550
What happened?
Did you have a fight with Shishi?

335
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,440
I don't even want to talk about it.
You had no idea

336
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,440
how stubborn Zhou Shi is.

337
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,030
I only gave her my opinions.

338
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,960
If I said one thing,

339
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,230
she'd answer me back
more than necessary.

340
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000
She didn't even give me
a chance to speak at all.

341
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,640
Let me guess.

342
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,110
Did you use your experience
to put her down again?

343
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,400
But I'm indeed more experienced.

344
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,590
Shouldn't she respect me as a senior?

345
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,440
Mr. Wei,

346
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,520
I thought you hate people
who use experiences as a weapon.

347
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,670
When we first took over Yunma,

348
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,590
didn't you hate it

349
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,030
when those old guys
kept telling you what to do?

350
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,230
That was because...

351
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,590
Wait, whose side you're on now?

352
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,590
Why are you taking Zhou Shi's side?

353
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,470
Of course, we're on your side.

354
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,470
But

355
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,550
if you want to reconcile with Shishi,

356
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,000
you need to be soft.

357
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,470
You know Shishi becomes more stubborn
if you pressure her.

358
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,960
The more you're hard on her,
the harder she'll be on you.

359
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,350
All right. Fine.

360
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,880
Just give in, right?

361
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,320
I can do it.

362
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,150
Mr. Wei, we won't be in your way, then.

363
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,640
Or do you need our advice?

364
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,030
No need. I can just do what you do.

365
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,030
Slave of a wife.

366
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,200
A wife is someone for you to dote on.

367
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,670
Enough already. Just get back to work.

368
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,590
Okay.

369
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,680
Excuse me,

370
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,520
can I have a glass of hot water?

371
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,000
Sure. Please wait for a moment.

372
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,710
Thank you.

373
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,350
What's wrong? Are you sick?

374
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,350
I'm fine.

375
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,560
It's gastric

376
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,760
relapsing.

377
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,400
A relapse?

378
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,070
You don't eat on time every day.

379
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,590
Of course, your stomach can't take it.

380
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,920
You must be hungry.

381
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,230
A little.

382
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,590
I'll take you out for a meal.

383
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,160
No, I haven't finished my work.

384
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,400
Did you throw away the sushi?

385
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,920
It's all finished.

386
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,590
How about this?

387
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,190
I'll buy something light for you first.

388
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,350
After you've finished your work,

389
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,800
I'll take you out for a meal.

390
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay.

391
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,920
Foolish.

392
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,980
(Yintai Mall)

393
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,280
This is life.

394
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,640
You must eat on time

395
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,470
to live like this.

396
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,230
I wanted to eat on time too.

397
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,830
But I couldn't
because of my busy schedule.

398
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,040
Do you need to work this hard?

399
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,950
Shouldn't we work hard

400
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,430
while we're still young?

401
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,800
Didn't you work even harder

402
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,310
when you built Yunma?

403
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,710
It's precisely because I've been there,

404
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,400
I don't want you
to suffer this hardship.

405
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,230
No one can run from hardship.

406
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,830
If you don't suffer in this aspect,

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,830
you'll suffer in another way.

408
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,280
Don't you know
the conservation of energy?

409
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,590
The thing is...

410
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,760
Well...

411
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,560
Stop right there.

412
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,190
If you want me to return to Yunma,

413
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
you can give up now.

414
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,310
If you continue,

415
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,040
it'll only make us fight.

416
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,830
Can you tell me why?

417
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,000
I want to know the reason.

418
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,680
The real reason is...

419
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,280
I don't want to work under you anymore.

420
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,800
The attitude you gave me
at the art gallery just now was...

421
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,710
If I work under you,

422
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm going to be livid.

423
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,590
No. No way!

424
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,430
Actually,

425
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,350
distance makes the heart grow fonder.

426
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,470
I hope we can maintain

427
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,190
this safe distance for now.

428
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,800
It's good for you and me.

429
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,830
Zhou Shi!

430
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,880
Brainiac?

431
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,920
Anyone home?

432
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,760
I'm starving.

433
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,830
How I miss the days

434
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,040
to see food Zhou Shi cooked
when I come home.

435
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,040
Those were the days.

436
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,800
This is too much!

437
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,680
It's all finished,
and the house is in a mess!

438
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,160
I need a 6x magnifying scope.

439
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,800
I only have a 4x magnifying scope.

440
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Give it to me, then. Give it.

441
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,110
Okay, I'll throw it out.

442
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,800
Okay.

443
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,110
There's someone in front.

444
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
There's someone
in your nine o'clock direction.

445
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,230
Hit him! I'll block him! I'll block him!

446
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,560
Can you block him?

447
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,520
Yes.

448
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,000
You're home.

449
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,920
I thought you were filming tonight.

450
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,400
You two, get out.

451
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,230
Stop eating and put your legs down!

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,470
Did someone offend you?

453
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,160
Why are you venting on me?

454
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,760
Since you want to stay at my place,

455
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,760
you should abide by my rules.

456
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,160
Bi Qiujing,

457
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,230
when did you start
getting along with him?

458
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,470
Theoretically speaking, Xue Ning

459
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,430
is Ning Fei who temporarily
lost his memories.

460
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,070
They're the same person.

461
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,920
I only shift my feelings from Ning Fei

462
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,920
to Xue Ning

463
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,350
with some reservations.

464
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,430
Nothing is wrong with that.

465
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,760
Did you hear that?

466
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,520
Even Miss Brainiac knows this.

467
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
I advise you

468
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,640
to treat me better.

469
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,040
If I suffer,

470
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,070
Ning Fei is going to suffer too.

471
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,800
Can you bear to watch Ning Fei suffer?

472
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,400
Generally speaking,

473
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,160
he's Zixia and Qingxia now.
[*classic roles from a Chinese movie]

474
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,110
If you want to see Zixia,

475
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,760
you'll have to take care of Qingxia.

476
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,310
I understand this one.

477
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,350
Give me five.

478
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,280
Fine, fine.

479
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,590
I don't care.

480
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,680
Unbelievable.

481
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,070
Wait.

482
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,160
Where should I sleep tonight?

483
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,710
Of course,

484
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,160
I don't mind sleeping at the same place.

485
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,590
Where did he sleep last night?

486
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,760
Last night, I...

487
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,710
Of course, he slept on the couch.

488
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,160
Don't worry.

489
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,760
I'll definitely arrange

490
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,160
a great place for you to sleep.

491
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,920
You want me to sleep here?

492
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,160
There's no door at all.

493
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,710
What about my privacy?

494
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,830
Privacy.

495
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,470
Miss Brainiac...

496
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,350
No point begging me.

497
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,070
This was where Ning Fei used to sleep.

498
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,400
It's fair for you to sleep here.

499
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,310
This is what I like

500
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,000
about your fair and just attitude.

501
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,190
Time to sign the contract.

502
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,000
Let's go.

503
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,920
I'll put aside you making me
sleep at the window way.

504
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,830
What kind of nonsense contract
do you want me to sign?

505
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,520
These conditions are nonsense.

506
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,310
"No female friends are allowed
in this house."

507
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,350
"You're Ning Fei only in this house."

508
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,710
This is too much.

509
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,000
Sign or leave.

510
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,640
"You must cooperate

511
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,800
with Lin Feifei's treatment plan."

512
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,000
What treatment plan?

513
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,760
What's wrong with you?

514
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,680
I'm helping you with treatment.

515
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,950
Isn't this what's shown in dramas?

516
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,920
If a person loses his memories
from head trauma,

517
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,230
he'll only need to hit his head again
to regain his memories.

518
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,710
I was just experimenting.

519
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Am I right, Miss Brainiac?

520
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,800
Memory disorder

521
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,640
is a complex pathological process.

522
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,000
Suppose the head suffers
a serious head injury

523
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,470
to the frontal lobe, temporal lobe,

524
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,230
hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, thalamus,

525
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,640
diencephalon,
or midbrain reticular formation.

526
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,400
In that case,
it's likely to cause memory loss.

527
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,680
But to cause a second head trauma

528
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,640
to regain memory loss?

529
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,430
There is no scientific basis
for this at present.

530
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,830
I think you can just pretend
you just watched a drama.

531
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,520
Looks like I have to
control my strength.

532
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,070
Hey!

533
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,190
You're a madwoman!

534
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,310
You don't have to sign.

535
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,800
You can still back out.

536
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't think you'll beat me
to death anyway.

537
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,470
When I get hurt,

538
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,230
it's Ning Fei who gets hurt anyway.

539
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,920
You decide.

540
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:06,400
(Party B's signature: Xue Ning)

541
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,040
Where are you going?

542
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,430
To take a shower.

543
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,230
Do you want to join me?

544
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,680
Do you think he'll regain his memories?

545
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,350
Everything is possible.

546
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,520
Xue Ning refused to face

547
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,590
what happened in the past

548
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,640
because he didn't want to face

549
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,280
how useless he was.

550
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,640
If he suffers from the same blow,

551
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,590
he's likely to regain his memories.

552
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,830
Should I hire someone to beat him up?

553
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,830
Don't be rash.

554
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,680
Don't ever be rash.

555
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,760
I don't care.

556
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,560
As long as he can regain his memories,

557
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,560
I'm going to try everything.

558
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,560
Jeez!

559
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,040
It's cold!

560
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,590
Lin Feifei, you again!

561
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,880
What are you doing?

562
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,920
I heard sudden provocation can help

563
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,310
in regaining one's memories.

564
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,560
What's wrong with me experimenting?

565
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,230
I don't mind.

566
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,070
I love cold showers anyway.

♪I love showering
and it's good for the skin♪

568
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,710
Lin Feifei,

569
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,830
I've caught a cold. It's your fault.

570
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,310
There are girls staying here.

571
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,760
Can you be considerate?

572
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,160
Tell me.

573
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,560
How are you going to compensate me?

574
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,640
It's necessary to sacrifice
for an experiment.

575
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,680
I feel apologetic too.

576
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,560
But this situation is inevitable.

577
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,430
Since you've signed the contract,

578
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,590
just bear with it.

579
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,470
What are you doing?

580
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,950
Do you really hate me that much

581
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,590
that you want me gone?

582
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,470
If you don't go,

583
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
he can't come back.

584
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,070
What's so great about him?

585
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,400
He's better than you.

586
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,640
You're really sick?

587
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,680
What did you think?

588
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,430
I'm blackmailing you with my cold?

589
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,070
I'll get you medicine.

590
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,590
I don't want to take medicine.

591
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm hungry. Cook noodles for me.

592
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:26,950
What?

593
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,920

Sure.

597
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,110

after combining your opinions.

637
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,070
This is the final draft of the plan.

638
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,710
Take a look.

639
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,640
No need. I can do it.

640
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,760
What do you mean?

641
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,710
This plan is okay. Just use it.

642
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,640
Didn't you insist

643
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,350
on using Wu Zheng's classic works?

645
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,310
I've come around.

646
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,680
Compared to you,

647
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,230
the biennial is not important to me.

648
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,470
You can just decide.

649
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,950
As long as you're happy with it.

650
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,640
Mr. Wei,

651
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,830
I'm discussing this seriously with you.

652
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,880
Please don't involve
your personal feelings.

653
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,830
I'm talking about work.

654
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
This plan is okay. Just use it.

655
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,190
But you didn't even read it.

656
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,640
I don't need to. I trust you.

657
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,230
All right. Since we're done with work,

658
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,560
let's eat

659
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,710
to celebrate that your plan has passed.

660
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,230
Wei Qing, can you be a bit serious?

661
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,520
I've carefully considered your opinion

662
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,830
and made some changes.

663
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,830
Can you respect

664
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,070
the outcome of my hard work?

665
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,800
All right.

666
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm sorry.

667
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,350
I know it's your first exhibition

668
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,560
and you're under a lot of pressure.

669
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,000
What do you mean by that?

670
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,070
Are you saying it's my problem?

671
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,230
I didn't mean it that way.

672
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,000
Why are you always upset
at everything that I say?

673
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,680
Wei Qing,

674
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,640
I don't know

675
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,430
why you're here.

676
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,400
At the company,

677
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,160
we're just business partners.

678
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,560
If you can't even respect

679
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,110
your business partner,

680
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,760
I want you to leave now

681
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,470
and let me do my work.

682
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,560
All right.

683
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,190
I'll go. Don't be upset.

684
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,280
This is so upsetting.

685
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,950
Pei, if Wei Qing comes back,

686
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,070
don't let him in my office.

687
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,680
Come in.

688
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,800
Shishi.

689
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,950
Mingcheng?

690
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,430
Why are you here?

691
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,350
Did he ask you to come to plead for him?

692
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
Mr. Wei sent me here

693
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,110
to take over the biennial exhibition.

694
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,520
He only knows how to run away.

695
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,560
Why did you fight again?

696
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,680
Mr. Wei looks hurt.

697
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,710
I don't want to talk about it.

698
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,110
Mingcheng,

699
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,640
you don't look well.

700
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,160
Did that capitalist,

701
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,470
Wei Qing, overwork you?

702
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,000
No.

703
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,640
The workload is indeed heavy lately.

704
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,310
But it's because Mr. Wei
thinks highly of me

705
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,280
and lets me manage

706
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,280
important matters.

707
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,000
Wei An has been helping me out too.

708
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,230
We're pretty busy, but it's fulfilling.

709
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,710
But you've changed a lot.

710
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,470
You're no longer that kid.

711
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,590
After all, not anyone

712
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,000
can upset him this much.

713
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,160
You're right.

714
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,710
It may not be long
since we joined the workforce.

715
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,560
But everyone has changed.

716
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,190
But not Miss Brainiac.

717
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,160
Her heart is still as pure as before.

718
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,470
And we're

719
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,430
a part of the workforce now.

720
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,920
You're right.

721
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,680
That's why I cherish her innocence.

722
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,880
I hope I can protect her.

723
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm so envious of her.

724
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,830
If only Wei Qing is half as nice as you

725
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,000
and respects his girlfriend,

726
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,000
I won't be this upset.

727
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,640
Shishi,

728
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,640
Mr. Wei is really concerned about you.

729
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,590
But it can't be avoided

730
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,470
that someone

731
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,950
in his position thinks differently
from we do.

732
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,110
Besides, you were

733
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
in a long-distant relationship
for too long.

734
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Mr. Wei becomes very insecure.

735
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,710
That's why he's very controlling.

736
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,190
But he's doing his best to change now.

737
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,310
Before I came here, he told me

738
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
to put on good words for him.

739
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,470
Well, you did say
a lot of nice things about him.

740
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,000
Tell him to give you a pay rise.

741
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,880
By the way,

742
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,190
how are things
between you and Miss Brainiac?

743
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,070
When are you going to take her home?

744
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,880
She told me she wants to
stay at Feifei's place

745
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,110
for a few more days.

746
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,710
I respect her wishes.

747
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,230
If she wants to come home,

748
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,880
I can pick her up anytime.

749
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,040
What caused you

750
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,160
to have a fight?

751
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,070
I have no idea.

752
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,000
Did she tell you guys

753
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,880
anything?

754
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,590
Forget it.

755
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,000
We should get down to business first.

756
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,830
Show me the plan.

757
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,080
Okay.

758
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,870
Darling,

759
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,000
have you eaten?

760
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,630
Tell me if you want to come home.

761
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,800
I'll go and pick you up, okay?

762
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,520
Why is she mad at me?

763
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,280
Before I leave,

764
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,190
I have a question for you.

765
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,000
Do you still remember me?

766
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,040
Bi Qiujing.

767
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,630
Darling, you...

768
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,950
Don't call me that.

769
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,360
Let me explain, Bi Qiujing.

770
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,470
Do you know who you're calling?

771
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,520
That person is no longer here.

772
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,120
Could it be

773
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,670
that she knows something?

774
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,520
Come in, please.

775
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,390
Mr. Li, my resignation process is done.

776
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,230
So I drop by to say goodbye.

777
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,320
Okay.

778
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,580
(Work License Use Contract)

779
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,390
I'll walk you out.

780
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
What's your plan after this?

781
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,040
Nothing for now.

782
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,950
It's all right. Take your time.

783
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
You're still young.

784
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
You have many opportunities
ahead of you.

785
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,600
Mr. Li,

786
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,670
you still speak like a straight arrow.

787
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,870
Goodbye, Rachel.

788
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,870
I wish you a bright future.

789
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,040
Mr. Li...

790
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,080
I mean, Senior Mingcheng.

791
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,120
After I leave,

792
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,760
we won't see each other anymore.

793
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,800
Can you call me by my name once?

794
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,000
Calling you Rachel is more convenient.

795
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,470
In my heart,

796
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,040
you're Rachel,

797
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,520
and Bi Qiujing is Bi Qiujing.

798
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,360
Take care.

799
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,710
Send this contract

800
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,120
(Work License Use Contract)
to Mr. Wu Zheng.

801
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,190
Yes, Mr. Li.

802
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,760
Looks like she's in a good mood.

803
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,430
She even called me.

804
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,120
Where are you!

805
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,710
I almost reach your company.

806
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,120
Did you miss me?

807
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,000
What's wrong with her?

809
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,560

810
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,600
Morning.

811
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,800
What did you do?

812
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,910
What did I do?

813
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,670
Wu Zheng's secretary just called

814
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,040
