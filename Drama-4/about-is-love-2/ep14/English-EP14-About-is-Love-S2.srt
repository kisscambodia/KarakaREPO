18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,680
Why is she so fond of both of us?

19
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,360
I have further studied

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,590
her articles.

21
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,720
I noticed

22
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,230
that she only admired Wei Qing at first.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,720
Later on, she was rescued by you.

24
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,000
She probably developed
an adoration of you.

25
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,360
She has been hoping
for you two to get together

26
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,480
to fulfill her greatest fantasy of love.

27
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,310
She even learned about your history.

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,190
From how you two met, fell in love,

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,510
to the events that happened later on.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,870
She knows almost everything.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,190
If that's the case,

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm against meeting her.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,670
Why not?

34
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,240
I don't want to use Wu Xiao.

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,110
Whether it's using her admiration

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,630
or if she thinks she owes me,

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,030
I don't want something good

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,670

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,670
How are you going to meet Wu Zheng then?

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,720
We acted too rashly today.

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,360
I want to be well-prepared

42
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,600
and meet him with sincerity.

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,830
There are millions of paths to take.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,470
Must you pick the toughest one?

45
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,600
We were in the wrong first.

46
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,390
If he finds out

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,240
that we got to meet him
by taking a shortcut,

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,470
he would definitely think

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
that we are people

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,720
who would do anything
to get what we want.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,000
How are you going to meet him then?
By waiting forever?

52
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,110
We should at least
show that we are sincere.

53
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,630
I still believe

54
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,240
that if you put your heart into it,
there's nothing you can't achieve.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,470
How long do you plan to wait?

56
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,390
I'll just keep waiting

57
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,190
until he is willing to meet me.

58
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,830
I won't let you.

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,630
On what grounds?

60
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,080
The fact that I am the CEO of Yunma

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,160
and this incident

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,880
happened in my company.

63
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,880
I will take care of it.

64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,470
I won't let you grovel to others.

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,390
You have your way of doing things.

66
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,880
I have my own principles.

67
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,880
You don't have to agree with me,

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,440
but you can't stop me.

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,470
Where are you going?

70
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
Relax.

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,630
You don't want to use Wu Xiao.

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
So I won't go to her.

73
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,030
He's just concerned about you.

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,720
He can't bear to see you suffer.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,270
You don't have to defend him.

76
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
He's just a domineering maniac.

77
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,550
Isn't it a good thing

78
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,910
that he's a wife-protecting maniac?

79
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,630
I don't need his protection.

80
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
I just wish

81
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,470
that he could understand me.

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,750
But understanding goes both ways.

83
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,630
He thinks that love means protecting you
in a domineering way.

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,910
You don't have to accept it,

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,670
but don't neglect his love.

86
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,880
I wish to neglect it,

87
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,270
but I can't stop myself from failing to.

88

(Zheng House)

89
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,110
What are you looking at?

90
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,830
It's Zhou Shi.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,230
She came and asked to see you.

92
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,600
I didn't let her in.

93
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,600
So she's been standing outside waiting.

94
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,200
Waiting under the sun?

95
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,760
She's even using
such an old-fashioned tactic.

96
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,550
I guess she's really desperate.

97
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,350
I think

98
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,790
Zhou Shi seems pretty sincere.

99
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,550
Perhaps there's truly a misunderstanding
with the contract incident.

100
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Why don't you...

101
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,350
Zhou Shi might be all right,

102
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,550
but it's hard to say for Wei Qing.

103
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,110
I've heard of his methods.

Tell her to leave.

108
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,270
I've told her.

109
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,440
She refused to leave.

110
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,440
I don't think she will give up

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
unless she meets you today.

112
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,950

113
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440

I'm still young.

Fine. You're the youngest here.

You're a pretty and adorable young lady.

Obviously.

217
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,880
Talk to you later.
I have to get my makeup done.

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,080
By the way, stay here
and don't try anything funny.

219
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,590
Don't go anywhere. Do you hear me?

220

222
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,030
A kissing scene.

223
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,030
You can't.

224
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,840
Why not?

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,590
I don't allow other men to kiss you.

226
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
This is my job.

227
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,910
Then pick another job.

228
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,150
Pick another job?
Are you going to support me financially?

229
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Besides, who are you to tell me that?

230
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,790
What if it were my past self

231
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
telling you that?

232
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,710
You wouldn't have minded then.

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,880
I don't believe you.

234
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,670

235
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,150

236
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,440
declaring dominance?

237
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,320
What are you talking about?

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,030
Did you remember something?

239
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,840
Feifei, you're here.

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,280
The director is asking for you.

241
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,000
Quickly get changed. Okay?

242
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,000
Where do you girls
usually go and have fun

243
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,230
around here?

244
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,910
There's a hot spring.

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,790
Yes, it's just nearby.
It looks exquisite.

246
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,000
So sorry.

247
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,230
Really? Where is it?

248
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,590
- How do I get there?
- Just nearby.

249
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,960
What's the name?
I'll search for it online.

250
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,960
- Jiang.
- Dajiang?

251
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,670
You get to wear a kimono.

252
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,110
Let's connect on WeChat.
We can hang out together next time.

253
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,520
- Sure.
- Here.

254
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,670
Feifei.

255
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,110
Here you are.

256
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,640
Let's hang out next time.

257
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,400
What were you doing?

258
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,670
Having a chat.

259
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,710
Why? Am I not even allowed to chat?

260
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,280
You can chat, but why connect on WeChat?

261
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,910
We got along quite well.

262
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,710
What's wrong? Are you jealous?

263
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,640
You wish.

264
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,110
I just don't want you
flirting with girls

265
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
with Fei's body.

266
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,350
What do you mean by Fei's body?

267
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,840
It's my body too. Okay?

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You stole it.

269
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,910
Fine. I don't want to argue with you.

270
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,520
If you don't want me
to flirt with girls,

271
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,230
then I won't.

272
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,670
That easy?

273
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,640
But you must agree to one condition.

274
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,840
Stop scolding me.

275
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,440
Okay. Deal.

276
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,880
You said something about
declaring dominance.

277
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,110
Did you remember something?

278
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,350
Once in a while,

279
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,230
I do recall some bits and pieces.

280
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,320
Then did you recall

281
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,640
memories of us?

282
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,400
I'll tell you if you come closer.

283
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,790
You ras...

284
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,840
You promised that you wouldn't hit me.

285
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,790
Then why did you kiss me?

286
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,840
Didn't you ask me what I remembered?

287
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,350
The most I managed to remember

288
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,470
was the two of us kissing.

289
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,150
You're so annoying.

290
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,150
Do well at your shoot,

291
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,880
Superstar.

292
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,000
Stop.

293
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,080
You've fallen into it

294
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,230
and you're only falling in deeper.

295
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
But...

296
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,760
he's still Ning Fei.

297
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,640
Even if I can't have his soul,

298
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,760
I can still see him every day, right?

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,280
What you're doing is drinking poison
to quench your thirst.

300
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,710
If I get to see him every day,

301
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,350
I don't mind drinking poison.

302
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,350
Didn't you say that you don't miss him?

303
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,520
Why have you changed your mind?

304
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,550
Previously, I thought I was dumped...

305
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,670
Betrayed.

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,790
Now that I'm aware of his condition,

307
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,840
I can't just leave him like this, right?

308
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,110
Even if I want to break up,

309
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,470
I should wait until he has recovered.

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
That's very selfless of you.

311
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
You go, girl.

312
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,710
Enough about me.

313
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,150
Shouldn't you
be changing your image right now

314
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
to make things fresh and exciting
for Li Mingcheng?

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,320
Why are you here again?

316
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,670
I came up with a lot of plans,

317
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,760
but I'm not good at this aspect.

318
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,280
I was afraid that there might be
mistakes in my judgment.

319
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,280
After thinking it over,

320
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,670
I thought you have the best taste

321
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,550
among the people I know.

322
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
That's why I was hoping
you could help me change my image.

323
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,710
Really?

324
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,000
Am I that important to you?

325
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,790
Just you wait.

326
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,230
You gave me your trust.

327
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,550
I now repay you with a surprise.

328
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,110
The moment you step out of this door,

329
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,230
I will make sure Li Mingcheng

330
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,280
becomes crazy about you all over again.

331
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Slow down.

332
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,150
Won't this be a little too much?

333
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,280
No, no. Absolutely not.

334
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,840
You look stunning.

335
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,910
I didn't know
that our Miss Brainiac here

336
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,000
has been hiding her curves.

337
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,440
Are you sure that Li Mingcheng

338
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
will like this?

339
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,000
I am absolutely sure and certain.

340
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,030
First, let's be clear about one thing.

341
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Women dress up

342
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,550
for themselves, not others.

343
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,550
Men are indeed

344
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,030
interesting living creatures.

345
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,200
Miss Brainiac.

346
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,760
The dress is fire. You look amazing.

347
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,110
What does that have to do with you?

348
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,400
She is taken.

349
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,910
Go back to your den.

350
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,640
I will hang around wherever I want to.

351
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,760
This is my house.

352
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,960
Fine.

353
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,030
Let's leave.

354
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,960
We're almost done with the outfit.

355
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,590
As for the hairstyle...

356
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,280
How should I style it?

357
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,880
Goodness gracious.

358
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,430
Your glasses look hideous.

359
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
Wear contact lenses, okay?

360
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,230
I also have to give you
a full skin-treatment

361
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,920
so that you get
an inside-out transformation.

362
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,070
I recently found a domestic product.

363
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,680
It's really effective.

364
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,710
Try it.

365
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,710
I can accept all of these.

366
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,190
But this lingerie

367
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,040
feels weird.

368
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,110
Weird?

369
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,950
Come here.

370
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,310
Listen. this lingerie
is the true essence.

371
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,190
It's a gift specially for Li Mingcheng.

372
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,520
To let him truly feel

373
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,160
what inner beauty is.

374
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,880
Inner beauty.

375
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,710
But there's nothing much under this.

376
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,680
Trust me. I won't be wrong.

377
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,830
We're almost done with your appearance.

378
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,000
Now we need to work on
your inner transformation.

379
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,920
So that you become

380
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,590
more feminine.

381
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,760
How?

382
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,190
(Cheer him on.)

383
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,000
(And then?)

384
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,830
(Can I give him a hug?)

385
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,710
(What you did for Tony Leung earlier
was the same...)

386
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,470
You want me to be like her?

387
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,830
It's Lin Chiling. Baby.

388
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,310
We only have one night.

389
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,470
So we must

390
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,230
do our best!

391
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,800
Do our best.

392
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,710
You're home.

393
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,920
So? Did you manage to meet Mr. Wu?

394
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,470
Why is your face red?

395
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,470
You got sunburned.

396
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,190
Why didn't you use the umbrella?

397
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,070
That would make me look insincere.

398
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,000
You taught me that.

399
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,040
(He's just concerned about you.)

400
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,880
(He can't bear to see you suffer.)

401
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,070
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

402
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,040
Here.

403
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,590
It might hurt a little.

404
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,950
Bear with it for a while.

405
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,350
Don't look at me
with those pitiful eyes.

406
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,160
Look to the side.

407
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,470
It doesn't hurt if I look at you.

408
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,350
All right. Look at me.

409
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,590
You're such a kid.

410
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,070
It was so sunny outside.

411
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,110
You must have had a hard time.

412
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,310
It wasn't so bad.

413
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,760
It's more effective for me
to get a sunburn than you.

414
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,000
Speaking of which,

415
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,350
Wu Zheng is really mean.

416
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
I stood outside for so long,

417
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,110
but I didn't even get a bottle of water.

418
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
What choice do you have
when you're notorious

419
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,760
for being a gentlemen killer?

420
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,400
All done.

421
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,470
What did you

422
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,040
apply to my face?

423
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,950
Will it get better tomorrow?

424
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,230
If I go there again,

425
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,590
will I still get sunburned?

426
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,350
You plan to go again tomorrow?

427
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,310
He hasn't yielded.

428
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,280
What else can I do?

429
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,640
Maybe

430
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,470
we could try a different way.

431
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,430
You've changed your mind?

432
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,310
If this way doesn't work,

433
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,760
we should try another one.

434
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,640
It's not like I insist on
sticking to this path.

435
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,070
But let me be clear.

436
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,710
We mustn't force her.

437
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,160
We must at least explain everything.

438
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,230
It's only okay
if she is willing to help us.

439
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,070
Sure thing.

440
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,230
Let me apply some more on your nose.

441
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,110
Where is she?

442
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,160
Over there.

443
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,590
She just got here.
She will probably be here for a while.

444
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,230
Can you do this alone?

445
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,920
Have some faith. Get rid of your doubt.

446
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,950
I forgot that you are
a skilled businessman.

447
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,000
Zhang Shuai, watch and learn.

448
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
You need it to end your single life.

449
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,280
Sure.

450
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,070
Thank you.

451
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,830
Wei Qing?

452
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,110
You're Wei Qing. Wei...

453
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,400
Keep it low-key.

454
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,400
I'm just here to have a meal.

455
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,880
You... I...

456
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,880
May I?

457
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,430
Yes, of course. Please have a seat.

458
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,160
Are you hungry?

459
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,880
The beefsteak here tastes delicious.

460
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,190
Try it.

461
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,160
Thanks for the courtesy,
but I'm not hungry.

462
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,430
I see.

463
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,230
Are you waiting for someone?

464
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,590
Is it Zhou Shi?

465
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,830
She rescued me before.

466
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,190
She's my savior.

467
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,350
Isn't it a small world?

468
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,160
Did she tell you about it?

469
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,560
Sure enough, he's still got it.

470
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
I was worried
that his skills had turned rusty.

471
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,830
He has you now.

472
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,880
He couldn't be bothered making an effort
in front of other women.

473
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,560
Isn't that a good thing?

474
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,310
All right.

475
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,920
Wait here. I'll go over.

476
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,040
Be on standby to assist us.

477
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,350
Go on.

478
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,800
Has she returned to the country?

479
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,830
Are you two together?

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,070
Are you two in a relationship?

481
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,280
We are indeed...

482
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,230
We are just colleagues.

483
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,710
Zhou Shi.

484
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
Zhou Shi.

485
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,760
Don't tell me
you two are here on a date.

486
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,230
Calm down.

487
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,800
We are actually here for business.

488
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,640
We've been hoping to meet your father,

489
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,160
but he refused to meet us.

490
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,560
So you two were the ones

491
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,830
who kept looking for him
the past few days.

492
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,230
What happened to your face?

493
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,470
Did you get sunburned?

494
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,520
Don't tell me

495
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,880
he made you wait under the sun.

496
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,230
How could he do that?

497
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,430
I can't believe this.
I will talk to him when I get home.

498
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,110
It has nothing to do with Mr. Wu.

499
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,160
We did it of our own accord.

500
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,400
Could you put in a word for us
with your father

501
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,800
so that he meets us?

502
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,350
All it takes is just for me
to say the word. Let's go.

503
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,310
Wait a minute.

504
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,230
You two aren't in a fight, are you?

505
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,950
How does this have anything to do
with meeting Mr. Wu?

506
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,310
Of course it does.

507
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,950
You see. I've always thought of you two

508
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,640
as my role models in love.

509
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,760
I told my dad

510
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,160
not to stop me from dating.

511
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,310
But if you two aren't even together,

512
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,590
then I'll no longer believe in love.

513
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,230
I've embarrassed myself

514
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,830
in front of my dad.

515
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,350
But...

516
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,110
The truth is

517
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,760
we've been in a relationship
a long time ago,

518
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,310
but we kept it a secret.

519
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,470
Really?

520
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,680
Yes.

521
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,280
Why else did you think I got sunburned?

522
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,160
What a sweet couple.

523
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,430
I dropped my phone. Let me get it.

524
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,070
Let me help you.

525
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,830
We agreed not to lie.

526
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,430
Who says I'm lying?

527
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,430
We're going to be a couple eventually.

528
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,950
It's just a matter of time.

529
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,190
But we shouldn't lie. What if she...

530
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
What are you two doing?

531
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,680
You're not

532
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,280
talking behind my back, are you?

533
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,230
I've got my phone. Here it is.

534
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,920
I have one small request.

535
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,640
Name it.

536
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,560
I really wish to see how you two
truly interact with each other.

537
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,160
That's not a problem.

538
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,230
Let's go then.

539
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,040
Let's go.

540
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
The view looks nice over there.

541
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,280
Let me take a picture of you two.

542
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,470
Stand closer to each other.

543
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,230
That's right. A little closer.

544
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,830
Can you two

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,800
smile more naturally?

546
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,350
It looks a bit like a staged photo.

547
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,880
It is staged.

548
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,880
Show your professionalism.

549
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,070
Yes, that's the feeling.

550
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,950
All right, why don't you two
take a break

551
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,640
while I pick out some photos?

552

Baby girl, you're a kid.

700
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,160

701
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,470

You're always on about adult matters.

706
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,950
Then when I date someone

707
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,640

708
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920

709
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,160

710
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,560

720
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,830
Just do me a favor.

721
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,830
If you're not happy with them,

722
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,310
I won't talk to them ever again, okay?

723
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,680

724

All right, all right.

728
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,390

729

We will get to the bottom of this
as soon as we can

730
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,470
and give you an explanation.

731
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
I know this explanation

732
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,870
sounds weak.

733
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,320
But please believe me.

734
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,800
Compared to profit,

735
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,870
I value reputation even more.

736
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,280
Besides asking for your understanding,

737
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,360
the reason we're here

738
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,800
is to also discuss the compensation.

739
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,430
We wish to minimize your loss
as much as we can.

740
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,840
Daddy.

741
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,040
Give them a chance.

742
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,000
I really like them. Besides,

743
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,630
they are also victims of this.

744
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
Since you're being so upfront,

745
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,190
and you even got yourself

746
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,950
such a tenacious lobbyist,

747
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,360
I won't hold

748
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,430
Yunma and Shangjue accountable.

749
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,080
I won't ask for compensation.

750
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,630
However, my partnership with both of you

751
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,190
ends here.

752
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,560
Mr. Wu.

753
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,670
Miss Zhou, this is my bottom line.

754
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,710
We respect your decision.

755
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,390
Once everything comes to light,

756
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,760
I will personally
make an official apology to you

757
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,430
in front of the public and media.

758
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,000
I hope we still have a chance
to work together in the future.

759
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,190
What's the matter?

760
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,000
We walked all day with Wu Xiao.
Now my feet hurt.

761
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,520
Let me have a look.

762
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,040
It's all bruised.

763
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,910
I just don't understand girls.

764
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,560
Why do you girls
like wearing high heels so much?

765
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,120
It's not that we want to.

766
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,520
We just don't have a choice.

767
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,630
I don't mind it.

768
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,360
Don't wear high heels
when you're with me

769
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,910
from now on.

770
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,280
Okay.

771
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,360
Let's go.

772
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,000
What are you doing?

773
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,390
Giving you a piggyback.

774
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,870
It's fine.

775
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,230
Get on my back.

776
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,390
Three, two...

777
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,360
You're too light.

778
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,000
Make sure you eat more, okay?

779
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,870
Got it. You're such a nag.

780
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,560
Luckily,

781
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,120
we managed to meet Mr. Wu in the end.

782
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,950
But it's also a shame
that we failed to get a partnership.

783
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,360
It's all right.

784
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
I'm happy

785
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,560
as long as we got to meet him
and explain everything.

786
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
You got yourself covered in bruises

787
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,760
just for the sake of an apology.

788
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,080
Was it worth it?

789
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,760
It was.

790
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,080
You're trying so hard.

791
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,000
Are you that eager to be a career woman?

792
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,910
I'm not trying to be a career woman.

793
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,710
I want to become

794
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,080
a better version of myself.

795
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,910
Why?

796
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,470
(I can only be by your side)

797
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,910
(if I become better.)

798
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,120
Come in.

799
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,280
What's with the clink-clanks?

800
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,840
It's hard to unscrew a lid
with one hand.

801
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,840
Don't you know how to ask for my help

802
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,430
with your hand like this?

803
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,760
I'm applying skincare.

804
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,120
How could I ask you for help?

805
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Let me help you.

806
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,710
Place a few drops on my hand.

807
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,560
Do you know how to do it?

808
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,190
I just have to try and see.

809
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,280
You seem like a professional
with your massage.

810
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,280
Then make sure

811
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,150
you give me a five-star rating.

812
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,670
Sure.

813
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,080
I'll tip you later.

814
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,230
Thanks.

815
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,870
By the way,

816
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
we also have a deluxe package.

817
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,600
Full-body wash and treatment.

818
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,560
If you continue harassing your customer,
I'm calling the police.

819
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,320
I was just making a suggestion

820
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,040
since you couldn't use your hand.

821
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,560
All right. Fine. You're so annoying.

822
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,000
Get out since you're done.

823
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,040
I need to take a shower.

824
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,000
Hang on.

825
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,080
Wait a minute.

826
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,000
Your face.

827
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,080
What's wrong?

828
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,710
