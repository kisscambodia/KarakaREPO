18
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:51,588
What?

19
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:54,027
He wants me to live in a hotel?

20
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:55,508
Only for a while.

21
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:56,548
The chairman said

22
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:58,828
that he would move you
to somewhere better after tonight.

23
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,268
He's obviously trying to kick me out.

24
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,308
Why?

25
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,107
Does he think of me as an eyesore?

26
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:07,387
To be honest with you,

27
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:08,707
yes.

28
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:11,667
Darn it.

29
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,147
What a jerk.

30
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,467
Tell you what.

31
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,107
He was the one who promised
to let me stay in this villa.

32
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,068
I will stay here.
I won't go anywhere else.

33
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:20,348
There's nothing he can do about it.

34
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:30,867
Mr. Xue, where do you want to go?

35
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:34,107
I'm homeless now. Where else can I go?

36
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:36,348
Don't you have any relatives or friends?

37
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:37,947
Perhaps,

38
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:39,867
but they are all in my past.

39
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,667
They have nothing to do with me now.

40
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:44,227
Wait.

41
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,107
This is my first time

42
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:48,188
seeing a jerk like your boss.

43
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,227
How dare he call himself
my brother? Ptui!

44
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:52,348
He's doing this for a woman, right?

45
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:54,188
She's not just any other woman.

46
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:56,428
She is the other half of Mr. Wei's soul.

47
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,027
Such a cliché,

48
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,988
giving me goosebumps all over.

49
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:04,867
What about you?

50
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:07,387
Is there a girl you put before yourself?

51
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:24,268
No.

52
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:33,027
Yes. I know.
The sunscreen advertisement.

53
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,908
I've been eating like a bird
for the past two days.

54
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:36,828
I thought the client

55
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,667
wanted me to look thinner on screen.

56
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,747
What? It's canceled?

57
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,307
Forget it, Hong.

58
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:47,708
You don't have to comfort me.

59
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,027
I've already gotten used to this.

60
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,548
I've got to go.

61
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,747
Okay. Bye.

62
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,268
Dear God,

63
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:04,068
seeing that my career
is not doing so well,

64
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:06,107
can you make my love life better?

65
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,920
(Brat 2.0: I'll count to three.
If you still won't pick up,)

66
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,600
(I'll be there. One. Two. Three.)

67
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:23,988
So annoying.
Do you think I'll believe you?

68
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:29,548
He made it here so quickly?

69
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,107
I didn't order any food delivery.

70
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,947
I placed the order.

71
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,227
Thank you.

72
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:54,227
Just leave them on the table.

73
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:17,067
Don't be shy. Eat all you want.

74
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:20,148
I'm not shy. This is my home.

75
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:22,748
If I remember it correctly,
I was the one

76
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:24,067
who rented this place.

77
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:25,708
I renewed the lease.

78
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,548
I reckon my sister was the one
who gave you the money.

79
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:30,428
You were the one

80
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:32,187
who told the landlord
about the breakup fee.

81
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:33,148
You...

82
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,347
I thought you didn't want
to go back to the past.

83
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:38,868
You know quite well

84
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:40,268
when someone can be of use to you.

85
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,387
You come and go as you wish.

86
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:43,627
Do you think you own this place?

87
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:44,667
Yes.

88
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:46,868
It's good that you didn't marry him.

89
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,067
Otherwise,
I will have to take care of you.

90
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,187
That's enough.

91
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,548
I didn't press on

92
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:53,667
when you broke the bowl.

93
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,947
And now what?
Did you come here to claim superiority?

94
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:57,588
Let's eat first.

95
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,947
It's mealtime now. Let's eat. Okay?

96
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,468
I'm not eating.

97
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,588
They are all high in calories and carbs.

98
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,347
Don't you know anything
about weight management?

99
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:06,988
After all, I'm a celebrity.

100
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,148
Forget it.

101
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,028
Other than all the cameo roles,

102
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:11,988
don't you spend the rest of your time
idling at home?

103
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:13,947
Why do you need to manage your weight?

104
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:16,187
When have you seen me

105
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:18,387
idling at home?

106
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,420
(WeChat)
(Hong: Okay.)

107
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:23,868
You...

108
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:25,828
When did you add my agent on WeChat?

109
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:27,148
You're a little-known celebrity,

110
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:29,028
so why don't you just enjoy life

111
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:31,588
and do things that make you happy?

112
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,787
Tell you what.

113
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:40,708
One day, I'll become a famous actress,

114
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,627
and then, you'll be kissing my butt.

115
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:43,507
Sure.

116
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,067
Do you want to try this?

117
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:46,187
Yes.

118
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:48,548
This tastes great. You know?

119
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:50,308
By the way,

120
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:52,268
what is this feast for?

121
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:53,227
Is it an apology?

122
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:54,387
It's not.

123
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,828
I'm here...

124
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,347
I'm here to drink with you.

125
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,468
Are you up for it?

126
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:05,268
Dare me. Fill the cup.

127
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:06,428
Sure.

128
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,028
What is it?

129
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:30,974
It's only been 2 years

130
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:32,507
and you've forgotten
about this place already?

131
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:35,227
That's not it.

132
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:38,187
At least, I know where the washroom is.

133
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:39,347
By the way, Mr. Wei.

134
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,988
If it's convenient for you,

135
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:42,308
can you lend me a set of clothes?

136
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,947
I've already got it prepared for you.

137
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,548
Wait.

138
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,588
Did you come all the way to my place

139
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,828
just to change your clothes?

140
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,028
Of course.

141
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:54,667
What else could I be here for?

142
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:02,468
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

143
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:04,667
What does she want?

144
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:06,907
Does it mean that I have to suffer
just because I took the initiative?

145
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:08,748
Make it clear.

146
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:10,627
How did Zhou Shi

147
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:11,988
upset you again?

148
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,988
She said she wanted to come to my place,

149
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,187
but when she arrived,

150
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:16,708
she acted as if it was nothing
but business.

151
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:18,227
She was obviously teasing me.

152
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:20,107
What is this?
Is she playing games with me?

153
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:21,748
Haven't you got it yet?

154
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:23,268
She only plays games with you

155
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:24,708
because she cares about you.

156
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:26,187
All you have to do now

157
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,107
is find a way to make her stay.

158
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:29,907
Get a chance to talk to her.

159
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:31,347
Talk...

160
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:33,748
Talk about what?

161
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:35,627
I'm speechless.

162
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:37,667
Do you really know nothing about love?

163
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,788
Of course, you have to tell her
how much you like her,

164
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:42,108
how much you love her,
and how much you want her back.

165
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,947
Are there any simpler ways of doing it?

166
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:48,187
Fine.

167
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,627
Tell her,

168
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:51,788
in the past two years,
you've been dreaming

169
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,708
about how happy things will be
if you get to be with her.

170
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:54,867
Wait.

171
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,228
That's not a dream.

172
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,788
You haven't met the new her.

173
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,307
What I said
is definitely an understatement.

174
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:00,307
You have no idea

175
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,427
how intimidating she looks now.

176
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:02,828
I haven't even seen her in a dress

177
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:04,507
since the day she came back.

178
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:07,867
I've got to go.

179
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:13,708
Where are you going in this dress?

180
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:14,908
Are you asking me?

181
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:16,788
You were the one
who prepared this dress for me.

182
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:17,627
Tell me.

183
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:18,547
Whose dress is this?

184
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:19,187
(Oh, no.)

185
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:21,148
(I bought this because I thought
it suits her really well,)

186
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,627
(but I've always kept it
in the wardrobe.)

187
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:24,468
(How did she find this dress?)

188
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:26,268
That's not mine.

189
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:27,588
Not yours?

190
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:29,468
(Does this belong to Ning?)

191
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,468
(Anyway, this dress fits me so well.)

192
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,627
(It's as if it was specially
made for me.)

193
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,387
Tell me the truth.

194
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,987
Are you keeping any other womenswear?

195
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,348
Are you kidding me? Of course, not.

196
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:52,627
Who picked this dress?

197
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:55,028
It's so revealing. What terrible taste.

198
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,427
It's cold outside.

199
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,627
You should leave
after your clothes are dry.

200
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:00,947
Forget it.

201
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,427
It won't take too long
to dry my clothes.

202
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,427
Perhaps, I should...

203
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:06,148
Take a rest on the massage chair.

204
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:07,547
I'll make you tea.

205
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:08,908
I don't like massage.

206
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:09,627
Do it.

207
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:10,387
I won't.

208
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:11,028
Do it.

209
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:11,867
I won't.

210
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,427
- Do it.
- Never!

211
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:15,547
I... Let go.

212
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,028
I don't want to do it.

213
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:25,947
Why can't I move?

214
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:27,348
The massage has started.

215
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:29,387
How long will this take?

216
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,507
Not too long. About half an hour.

217
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,867
I'll make you tea.

218
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:35,468
I...

219
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:36,947
It hurts.

220
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,700
(Leave Application. Bi Qiujing)

221
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,920
(Resignation Form. Bi Qiujing)

222
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:52,588
Li.

223
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:53,468
Please

224
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:54,828
send Rachel to my office.

225
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,670
(To Darling: Why did you go on leave
all of a sudden? What happened?)

226
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,450
(Chairman)

227
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,627
Mr. Wei.

228
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:12,668
Is your wife with you?
I need to talk to her.

229
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:14,228
I'm afraid I can't help you.

230
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:15,747
She took an emergency leave today,

231
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,588
and she's not answering my call.

232
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,108
Are you fighting?

233
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,028
No.

234
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:21,747
Mr. Wei, please don't be mean.

235
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:23,228
Forget it.

236
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,307
Besides your wife,
you can answer my question too.

237
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:26,867
Is your wife

238
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,867
pregnant?

239
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:31,468
She's not.

240
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:32,947
Why did you ask that all of a sudden?

241
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:33,987
Then...

242
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,908
How do you take care of her

243
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:38,668
during her menses?

244
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:41,108
I try to keep her in a good mood.

245
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,148
Anything else?

246
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:43,627
We will go
and see many different specimens,

247
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,987
ranging from meteorites
to natural surfaces.

248
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:47,547
Don't you do anything normal people do?

249
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,067
Before anything else,

250
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:50,507
I make sure she's not hungry.

251
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,828
I carry snacks with me all the time.

252
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:53,427
By the way, she has a cold womb.

253
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,987
So, I'd make her brown sugar ginger tea.

254
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,067
That's the one! I'll send you a video.

255
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,028
Put brown sugar,

256
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:04,947
black tea, and ginger

257
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,588
together in a pot. That's all, right?

258
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,828
Of course, not. Mr. Wei.

259
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:10,947
Follow what I'm going to tell you.
Do it step by step.

260
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,228
You do everything recklessly.

261
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:20,668
Didn't Zhou Shi say anything about that?

262
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,708
She won't let me come to your place.

263
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,187
I'm warning you.

264
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:27,108
If she asks you my whereabouts,

265
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:29,668
you should never reveal it.

266
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,947
I got it.

267
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,028
You're too old to be rebellious.

268
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:45,867
I thought we were going to drink.
Where's the drink?

269
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:49,828
I'm sure
it's the food delivery I ordered.

270
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:50,867
Wait.

271
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:52,747
I'm sure it's my parcel.

272
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,427
You'll have to sleep on the sofa tonight

273
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:56,708
if you are wrong.

274
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,228
Dare me.

275
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:12,908
Your liquor.

276
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,588
Your parcel.

277
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,627
And this
is for your weight management plan.

278
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,108
It will help you lose weight easily.

279
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:23,228
Wait.

280
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,828
Don't forget to change your shoes.

281
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,506
You're only drinking
and not eating anything.

282
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,028
This doesn't make sense.

283
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:56,307
This is what one does
when they are heartbroken.

284
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,187
Enough with that nonsense.

285
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,427
That's enough. Stop drinking.

286
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:02,908
You're drinking alcohol, not water.

287
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:04,468
It's nice drinking alcohol,

288
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:07,187
but it's no fun
dealing with the aftermath, Ms. Bi.

289
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:08,947
What were you doing before I came then?

290
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:09,987
We were...

291
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:11,108
Warming up.

292
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:12,268
Shut up.

293
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,468
I'll take back what I just said.

294
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,708
We are simply drinking together.

295
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:17,547
Yes.

296
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,067
Even if anything is to happen,

297
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,588
we will be too drunk to do anything.

298
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:22,708
That's why I always think
it doesn't make sense

299
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,468
when people say they lose their head
when they drink.

300
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,747
They both have that intention

301
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,828
when they decide to drink together.

302
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:39,067
Tell me.

303
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:41,067
This is my first time
seeing you drinking like this.

304
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:42,708
What happened?

305
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,028
You caught them on camera?

306
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:46,668
I already knew who that person is.

307
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:48,228
You're still as efficient

308
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,067
as always.

309
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,547
Why? The girl won't give up

310
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:53,828
and wants to compete against you?

311
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:54,908
It's the total opposite.

312
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,627
She gave up very easily.

313
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,148
Isn't that nice?

314
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:00,908
What's bothering you then?

315
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,187
What if I tell you

316
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,228
I'm his mistress?

317
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:12,348
What?

318
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,708
Are they a couple?

319
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:16,747
That's impossible.

320
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:17,867
We can all tell

321
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,947
that Li Mingcheng loves you
wholeheartedly.

322
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,307
Just like what you said.

323
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,627
He appears to love me,

324
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:25,268
but no one knows
what he actually thinks.

325
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:32,067
Turn off the stove,

326
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,788
and put the pot aside
to let it cool down.

327
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,627
Okay.

328
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:39,268
Really?

329
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:40,427
Really.

330
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:42,908
If you don't want Shishi to die,

331
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,507
please stop adding any weird stuff

332
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:45,747
into the soup anymore.

333
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:46,867
I'm warning you.

334
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,387
It better tastes good.

335
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:49,507
If it doesn't,

336
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:51,788
I'll make a lot of this
and bring it to the office every day.

337
00:15:57,627 --> 00:15:59,867
It took him an hour to make the dessert.

338
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:01,627
Since you aren't exactly blessed
with the gift,

339
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,387
I think you should give up
on being a caring guy.

340
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,268
Come in.

341
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:08,947
Mr. Li, are you looking for me?

342
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:09,908
Rachel,

343
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:11,307
about your resignation...

344
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:12,547
You don't have to convince me anymore.

345
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:14,668
I've made up my mind.

346
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:16,228
Have you thought it through?

347
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:19,987
Thanks

348
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:22,108
for all your guidance and patience.

349
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,028
I'm leaving this place with no regrets.

350
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:30,148
However, before I leave,

351
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,067
can I ask you a question?

352
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:33,348
Go ahead.

353
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,348
Do you still remember who I am?

354
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,348
Seven years ago...

355
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,228
Seven years ago.

356
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:56,067
She knew him way before I did.

357
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,187
I guess he only approached me

358
00:16:58,547 --> 00:16:59,867
because I share the same name

359
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,348
with this girl.

360
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,108
You're saying

361
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:09,268
that Li Mingcheng sees you
as her replacement.

362
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,988
From what you just told me though,

363
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,427
other than the same name you share,

364
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,067
you have totally different appearances

365
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,828
and personalities.

366
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:19,667
Why did he pick you over her?

367
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:23,187
Because we are very much alike.

368
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:26,868
When one can't find a partner
who complements them,

369
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:28,547
they will compromise

370
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,907
and go after someone
who resembles them a lot.

371
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:34,267
They gain self-affirmation
by liking the person.

372
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,307
This is what they call

373
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:38,508
the Narcissus Complex.

374
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,348
Na... Na... What?

375
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:43,468
Narcissus.

376
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:44,907
He was an extremely narcissistic
but handsome guy

377
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:46,588
in Greek mythology.

378
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,307
He turned into a daffodil
after his death.

379
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,748
If it is to be translated into Chinese,

380
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,628
we call it the Daffodil Syndrome.

381
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,708
Do you think you're so great
just because you speak English?

382
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:57,667
Stop drinking.

383
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,067
I'll have another one.

384
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:03,588
This alcohol is pretty strong.
You might get drunk.

385
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:05,307
Don't worry.

386
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:08,187
I have a high tolerance for alcohol.

387
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,588
Two of my liver enzymes

388
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:11,787
are of a higher-than-normal level.

389
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:13,508
Judging from my alcohol intake today,

390
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,108
it will take more than two hours

391
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,907
for my digestive system
to absorb the alcohol

392
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:19,748
and send it to other parts of my body.

393
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:20,828
Therefore,

394
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,228
I won't get drunk so soon.

395
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:24,667
Why?

396
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,307
You don't believe me?

397
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,108
Of course, I don't.

398
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,267
No one will believe you
when you're in this state.

399
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,267
Brat, stop filming.

400
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:36,588
If you keep filming, I will...

401
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:37,748
I will end your life.

402
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:43,508
Bi Qiujing.

403
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:46,588
To prove to you that I'm sober,

404
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:49,907
I'm going to read out the pi value.

405
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:51,147
World record.

406
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:54,228
3.141592653589

407
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:57,787
793238462643383...

408
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:00,508
Hey, I'll root for you.

409
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:02,427
Respect.

410
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:05,307
Can you stop fooling around with her?

411
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:07,147
Someone needs to take care of her.

412
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:10,787
Talk to her.

413
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,307
How long have I been asleep?

414
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,828
So he made all the fuss

415
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:38,427
just for this?

416
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,228
Is this even edible?

417
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:58,508
(I was right. Ning was here.)

418
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,150
(Little Devil)

419
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:19,828
18857527248912279381

420
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:25,147
83011949129833673362

421
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,027
4406566430...

422
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:30,067
I want to know
which decimal place is she currently at.

423
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:31,147
I didn't keep count.

424
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:32,667
More than hundreds, I guess.

425
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,187
By the way,

426
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:35,267
none of us knows

427
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,468
if those numbers are correct.

428
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,547
I'm curious.

429
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,748
Which decimal place
did the world record holder reach?

430
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,348
Around the 60,000th, I guess.

431
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,708
I heard

432
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:44,427
that it took him more than 20 hours.

433
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:45,988
Judging from the pace she's going at,

434
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,228
I think she'll need three days.

435
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:48,708
Three days?

436
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:52,108
Help me.

437
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:54,787
(Sorry. The number you've dialed)

438
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,667
(is currently unavailable.)

439
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,500
(Chen Liyun's Psychology Clinic)

440
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:12,468
Dr. Chen. It's me.

441
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:14,828
I can tell.

442
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:16,667
It's been a while, Zhou Shi.

443
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:18,348
Did you call me

444
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:19,947
because of Wei Qing's illness?

445
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:21,187
Wei Qing?

446
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,108
What happened to him?

447
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,027
If you're asking about his allergy,

448
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,628
he has recovered from it.
There's nothing to worry about.

449
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:31,748
That's good to hear.

450
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,748
However, I'm calling you

451
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:35,388
to get your opinion
regarding another friend of mine.

452
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,027
He ran into an accident before

453
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:38,947
and was traumatized.

454
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:40,468
He uses drugs to keep his emotions
under control,

455
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,307
but it has been a week

456
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:42,988
since he last took his medications.

457
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:44,787
And I've no idea where he went.

458
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:46,748
I worry

459
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:49,027
that his mental health
would deteriorate.

460
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:50,027
How about this, Zhou Shi?

461
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:51,307
Don't worry too much for now.

462
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:52,907
The first thing you should do now

463
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,787
is to locate him soon.

464
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:56,468
Don't worry.

465
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:58,267
I'm right here
and everything will be fine.

466
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:00,427
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

467
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:07,828
Was she talking

468
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:10,508
about Xue Ning?

469
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:15,267
Why did he stop taking his medication
all of a sudden?

470
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:21,667
That girl. She left so quickly.

471
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:40,267
(He fell asleep.)

472
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:42,427
(Anyway,
I shouldn't stay here any longer.)

473
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,868
(I'd better grab my bag and leave now.)

474
00:23:47,187 --> 00:23:49,588
That's another day wasted.

475
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:01,988
Feifei, you told me over the phone

476
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:03,588
that she was drunk.

477
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:07,388
It's okay. We can let her mind
wander a little longer.

478
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:10,147
That's right.

479
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:12,508
I got the 278th decimal place wrong.

480
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:14,508
All right. I'll do it all over again.

481
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:20,027
3.14159265358979323846...

482
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:22,947
She's at it again.

483
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,868
Li Mingcheng,
please keep your wife under control.

484
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:25,748
That's not right.

485
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:28,388
You missed a "three"
at the 25th decimal place.

486
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:34,147
Stop provoking her.

487
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:35,787
Can't you tell that she's already angry?

488
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:37,027
I'm not angry.

489
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:38,628
I simply got an adrenaline rush

490
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:39,828
because something happened,

491
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,228
and I am now going through
some emotional changes.

492
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:42,348
That means you're angry.

493
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,907
Did something happen?

494
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:57,708
She made a list of it,

495
00:24:57,828 --> 00:25:00,228
and you're the cause
of everything listed.

496
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:03,267
Feifei.

497
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:09,468
Darling...

498
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:10,828
I'm not your darling.

499
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:13,187
Listen to me, Bi Qiujing.

500
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:15,307
Do you know who you're talking to?

501
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:17,427
She's not here at the moment.

502
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,228
Darling.

503
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:25,988
I think it really got on her nerve.

504
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:29,027
Li Mingcheng
is going to have a hard time.

505
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:30,547
That might not be the case.

506
00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:33,067
You're drunk. Let's go home.

507
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:34,547
I'm not drunk,

508
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:35,988
and I don't want to hear you talking.

509
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:37,187
If you intend to explain yourself,

510
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:38,947
please answer all the questions
I've listed on the paper, one by one,

511
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:40,708
then send them to me via e-mail.

512
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:42,108
Now, please leave

513
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,787
and create the least friction possible

514
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,868
as you get out of my sight. Goodbye!

515
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,427
He's all done for.

516
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:52,988
I told you. That might not be the case.

517
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:55,187
Let me go, Li Mingcheng.

518
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:00,348
Okay.

519
00:26:01,147 --> 00:26:02,108
Do you have any more alcohol?

520
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,508
Look for it yourself.

521
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,770
(Zhou Shi)

522
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:15,667
Feifei, did Fei go and see you?

523
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:18,027
No. He's not here.

524
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:19,067
I see.

525
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,228
If he ever comes to you,

526
00:26:20,388 --> 00:26:22,108
please make him stay.

527
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,828
Zhou Shi, where are you going?

528
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:27,547
Did I hear a man?

529
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:28,828
You must have misheard.
There's no man here.

530
00:26:28,947 --> 00:26:29,667
I've got to go.

531
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:45,907
Look. I found more alcohol.

532
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,388
Where did you get that?

533
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:49,907
That doesn't matter

534
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:51,228
as long as we can keep drinking.

535
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,588
Fine, but you should go home
after this round.

536
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,307
Zhou Shi just gave me a call.

537
00:26:58,027 --> 00:27:00,348
Don't worry. I didn't rat on you.

538
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:01,868
You've been out for a very long time.

539
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,108
It's time you go home.

540
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:04,667
You just have to
make people worry about you, huh?

541
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:06,307
Worry?

542
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:08,947
Does any of you really worry about me?

543
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,667
All you do is tell me to go home,

544
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,508
but which one is my true home?

545
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,147
You only know the old me,

546
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:17,508
but none of you know who I am now.

547
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:19,468
You worry
that I'll get into trouble again,

548
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,427
so you're keeping me under your watch.

549
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:22,868
You call that worrying.

550
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:24,748
That's a lie.

551
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:27,588
Am I wrong?

552
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,350
(For Experiment Only)

553
00:27:37,628 --> 00:27:39,228
I only have our memories of the past.

554
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:40,228
What you forgot

555
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:42,187
is what I treasure the most.

556
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:43,027
You gave them all up,

557
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:44,748
and you dared to tell me to play along.

558
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:46,187
Do the memories matter so much?

559
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:47,508
Just because I'm not who
you want me to be,

560
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:49,187
my existence is now meaningless, right?

561
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:50,907
How is he better than me?

562
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:52,388
He's better than you in every sense.

563
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,307
Tell you what.

564
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:54,588
I don't care about you now,

565
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,787
and I don't want to have anything

566
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,108
to do with the present you.

567
00:27:57,228 --> 00:27:58,067
From tonight onward,

568
00:27:58,187 --> 00:27:59,228
you can go wherever you want,

569
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:01,307
but don't you ever show up before me!

570
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:13,468
What's going on?

571
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:16,108
Why do I feel like

572
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,947
I've seen this bottle of liquor before?

573
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:20,508
It's just some plum liquor.

574
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,380
(For Experiment Only)

575
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:25,628
Oh, man.

576
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:27,427
This is a strong alcohol

577
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:29,067
Bi Qiujing made in her experiment.

578
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:31,108
Why did you bring this out?

579
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,547
Luckily, I didn't drink any.

580
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:35,947
You distance yourself
from me so quickly.

581
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,027
Let me be clear.

582
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:42,267
It was you who took the initiative.

583
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:43,187
That's impossible.

584
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:44,427
No one knows the truth.

585
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,187
After all, I am your ex-boyfriend.

586
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:46,947
Are you sure

587
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:48,427
that you can resist the temptations?

588
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:51,988
Stop staring at me.

589
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,427
It's still the same face.

590
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,468
Is it that difficult to make a decision?

591
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:10,588
Just face the reality.

592
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:13,828
Either you accept me or you don't,

593
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,547
you can no longer say

594
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:19,388
that you've got nothing to do with me.

595
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:43,348
What was all that about?

596
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,147
Not only didn't I gain anything
after taking care of you

597
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:46,588
for the whole night,
but I also got a slap in the face.

598
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:01,267
What's wrong with you?

599
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,628
Do you really think
I won't do anything to you?

600
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:11,547
Go to sleep.

601
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:17,348
I shouldn't have teased her.

602
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:24,868
You're right on time.

603
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:27,868
Mr. Xue, where are we going today?

604
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:30,388
What do you mean?

605
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:31,828
Are you saying

606
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:33,547
that I don't get to go back
to the villa today as well?

607
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:36,628
Fine.

608
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,907
You don't have to drive me today.

609
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:40,508
Just do me a favor.

610
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:42,907
Then, I'll fulfill his wish

611
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:44,187
and stop bothering him.

612
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:45,427
This...

613
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:46,667
You can't turn me down.

614
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:49,067
