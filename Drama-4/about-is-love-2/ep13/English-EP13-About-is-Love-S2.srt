18
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:56,100
(Yunma Group)

19
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,080
Where is Mr. Wu?

20
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,720
Mr. Wu is busy with something else.

21
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll be in charge of everything.

22
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,230
I want to ask.

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,910
Why did Mr. Wu suddenly decide

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,080
not to collaborate with us?

25
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,440
We'll have to ask you then.

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,510
Why did you take the liberty

27
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,950
to change the contract
that we agreed on?

28
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,550
You only purchased the usufruct

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,630
to use the Aurora Constellation Series
from Mr. Wu.

30
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,760
But in the contract,

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,600
you changed it
to all of Mr. Wu's artworks.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,470
Is there a misunderstanding?

33
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,320
We didn't make any changes
to the contract.

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Everything is in black and white.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,190
Take a look for yourself.

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
Can you see it clearly now?

37
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,240
We really didn't change the content

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,320
of the contract.

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,440
But now that there's an issue
with the contract,

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,080
we'll investigate it.

41
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,360
Can you please ask

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,360
Mr. Wu to talk to us?

43
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,190
I want to explain it
to him face-to-face.

44
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,360
No need to explain.

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,240
This is considered a commercial fraud.

46
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,830
We've already contacted our lawyer.

47
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,550
We'll reserve the right to sue.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
We'll update you

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,720
about our decision later
after our discussion.

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,360
Bye.

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,110
Wait.

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Don't tell me that you suspect me.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,550
You were the last one
who checked the contract.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,880
You didn't notice anything out of place.

55
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,960
We had a dispute due to
a copyright issue before this.

56
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,390
Now, we are having the same issue.

57
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,000
It's hard not to suspect you.

58
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,800
Moreover, you were the last one
to stamp on it.

59
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,390
I was not the last one to stamp on it.

60
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,520
It wasn't Wei An either.

61
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,470
Who was it then?

62
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,080
It was Mingcheng.

63
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,470
This is the original copy
that I had printed out.

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,630
There's no problem with it.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,910
Did you check the contract

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,910
after printing it?

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
I did.

68
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,360
Was there anyone else
when you stamped on it?

69
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,390
No.

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
Have you checked the CCTV footage?

71
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,550
There was no one else.

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,390
Li Mingcheng was alone.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,910
I had asked the assistant
who delivered the contract as well.

74
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,030
Nothing went wrong.

75
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
Although you might be innocent,

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
something went wrong

77
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,270
with the contract after you had it

78
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,110
with you.

79
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,600
You'll be temporarily suspended.

80
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,390
Hand over

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,630
your work to Wei An.

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,630
Understood.

83
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,320
Mr. Wei.

84
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,600
If the Art Biennial is canceled

85
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,470
because of that contract,

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm willing
to take full responsibility for it.

87
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,670
Don't worry.

88
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,230
If you are indeed responsible for it,

89
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,160
you won't be able to escape
the punishment.

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,640
But...

91
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,830
You can go out now.

92
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,270
What do you think?

93
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,320
Mingcheng has always been cautious.

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,230
He won't make
this kind of petty mistake.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
You might be right.

96
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,040
But the contract

97
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,600
had only gone through three people.

98
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,110
If it's neither you

99
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,350
nor him,

100
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,950
I'm the only one left.

101
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,230
In my opinion, you are the main suspect.

102
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,110
After all, your past record
is against you now.

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,920
But so far, I still can't fathom

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,070
why you would do that.

105
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,480
So, in my opinion,

106
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,510
there's a 30% probability
that you are the culprit.

107
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,160
Why are you laughing?

108
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,640
You've indeed changed.

109
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,230
In the past,

110
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,950
you would have gotten angry
at me already.

111
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
And you would say

112
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,720
that I had treated Mingcheng unjustly.

113
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,950
I can't deny that.

114
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
Before this,

115
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,200
I had a quick temper.

116
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,790
But now,

117
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
I've changed a lot.

118
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,230
But

119
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
it doesn't mean
that I don't have a temper.

120
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,510
I've just gotten better
at controlling it.

121
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,440
If it's proven

122
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,480
that you are guilty in the end,

123
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,440
I'll show you

124
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,920
how furious I can get.

125
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,320
Was I being threatened?

126
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,350
Do you want to eat this?

127
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,480
Why aren't you eating?

128
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,160
Are you still thinking
about the contract?

129
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,110
I think it's too fishy.

130
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,550
If all three of us are innocent,

131
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,350
who else can it be?

132
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,110
Could it be that Wei Qing
is the real culprit behind it?

133
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,830
Wei Qing won't dig his own grave.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,880
What do you mean?

135
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
For a company like Yunma,

136
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,640
do you think Wu Zheng's copyright
is more important

137
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,000
than their reputation?

138
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,110
Although Wei Qing

139
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,830
is quite ruthless sometimes,

140
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,830
he won't do something

141
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,670
that will harm the reputation of Yunma.

142
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,200
I'm sure Zhou Shi knows that about him.

143
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,200
Yes.

144
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,830
With Wu Zheng's position
in this industry,

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,320
if he sues Yunma,

146
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,200
it'll bring

147
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,950
a severe negative impact on Yunma.

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
Wei Qing won't do something

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,320
that is unfavorable to him.

150
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,550
But if it's not him or Mingcheng,

151
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,670
who else can it be?

152
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,640
Could it be that Wei An is behind this?

153
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,950
Impossible.

154
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,790
It's even more impossible for him
to betray Wei Qing

155
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,000
compared to Mingcheng.

156
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,270
But come to think of it,

157
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,040
Mingcheng has been suspended now.

158
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,640
Shouldn't you keep him company

159
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,950
and give him some comfort?

160
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,350
Theoretically, I should go.

161
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,760
But comforting others
is not my expertise.

162
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,950
Moreover,

163
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,000
we are still holding a grudge
towards each other.

164
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,950
You can sort out that grudge later on.

165
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,950
He's going through desperate times now.

166
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm sure Mingcheng needs you.

167
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,950
But I don't know how to comfort someone.

168
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,440
That's easy.

169
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,350
Go back and hug him.

170
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,720
Dear, don't be upset.

171
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,270
No matter what happened,
I'll stay by your side.

172
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,510
Darling, I love you.

173
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,480
That's it.

174
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,600
An effective kiss

175
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
can indeed accelerate
the secretion of insulin

176
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,600
to release adrenaline

177
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,670
and achieve the goal
of making someone happy.

178
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,880
I can use this method.

179
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,440
Where are you going?

180
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,110
I'm going back to comfort Li Mingcheng.

181
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,760
You can go after you finish eating.

182
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
What's the rush?

183
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,480
I'll put in some vegetables for you.

184
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,160
Wait.

185
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,070
You've decided to kiss him tonight.

186
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,790
Don't eat any garlic.

187
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,280
But a hotpot without garlic

188
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,550
is incomplete.

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,470
Go ahead and eat it then.

190
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,030
No.

191
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,520
Where is Little Devil?
Why isn't he back yet?

192
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,400
He has been out early
and home late in the past two days.

193
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,790
I don't know what he's doing.

194
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,550
Let's eat.

195
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,350
It's just a lousy porcelain bowl.

196
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,960
Why can't they fix it?

197
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
I'll fix it myself then.

198
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,710
(Before I met him,)

199
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
(I always thought)

200
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,230
(that all humans were the same.)

201
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,910
(And that the distance)

202
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,080
(between us was just space.)

203
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,470
(But I didn't know
until that very moment)

204
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,440
(that a human could actually shine.)

205
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,440
(It turns out)

206
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,470
(that he can really shine.)

207
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,960
Why are you back?

208
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,640
Zhou Shi said
that you were in a bad mood.

209
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,230
So, I came back to visit you.

210
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,280
Shishi had told you about it?

211
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,640
Don't worry. I'm fine.

212
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,230
Wei Qing fired me
in order to protect me.

213
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,520
Otherwise, other people
in the company would criticize us.

214
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,880
I believe in you.

215
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,030
You wouldn't make such a petty mistake.

216
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,000
We just need to find out the truth.

217
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Is this

218
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,150
how you are going to comfort me?

219
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,840
(That's easy.)

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
Go back and hug him.

221
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,150
Dear, don't be upset.

222
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,550
No matter what happened,
I'll stay by your side.

223
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,840
Darling, I love you.

224
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,710
That's it.

225
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,910
What are you doing?

226
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,640
Dear, don't be upset.

227
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,470
No matter what happened,

228
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,960
you'll always have me by your side.

229
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you feel better now?

230
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
Yes.

231
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
But,

232
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,350
I still need more.

233
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,910
Come in.

234
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,400
Okay.

235
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,000
Hurry up with it.

236
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Contact me if you need anything.

237
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,080
Do you need anything?

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,350
Mr. Xue, I would like to discuss

239
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,520
the Art Biennial with you.

240
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,670
I already know.

241
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,230
Mr. Wu's secretary
has already contacted me.

242
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,710
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,910
I didn't manage it well.

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,350
But I think something fishy is going on.

245
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,880
I'll get to the bottom of it.

246
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,710
Forget it. No need to investigate.

247
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,790
Why?

248
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,280
To be honest, I'm not surprised

249
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,710
about this at all.

250
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,590
You can even say
that I've been expecting it.

251
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,550
I'm sure you know about me
and Xue Zi's relationship.

252
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,960
My sister in name

253
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,400
is the future successor
of the Snow Group.

254
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,440
But there are many people in the group

255
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,520
who think that she's not a real Xue.

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,960
They want to support another successor.

257
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,470
Me.

258
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,760
But I'm too inexperienced.

259
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,230
This Art Biennial

260
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,470
is a test for me

261
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,760
from the higher-ups of the company.

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Are you saying

263
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,670
that Ms. Xue wants to ruin this test?

264
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,710
My sister sent you here.

265
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,880
At first, I was wary of you.

266
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,710
But after a while, I realized

267
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,960
that you really wanted to make
the Art Biennial a success.

268
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,880
From that moment onward,

269
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
I knew

270
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,550
that you were just
one of my sister's pawns.

271
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,470
Ms. Xue sent me here

272
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,640
to help you out with the Art Biennial.

273
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,200
When was this photo taken?

274
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,320
Not long

275
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,230
after Wei Qing purchased
the stocks of Shangjue.

276
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,470
I always thought that he bought
the stocks of Shangjue

277
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,670
because of you.

278
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,110
Now,

279
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,230
it doesn't seem like it anymore.

280
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,470
Anyway,

281
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,230
this is the end of the Art Biennial.

282
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,030
You can go back to my sister now.

283
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,350
I can't go back until I settle

284
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,880
the issue of the contract.

285
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,760
As long as I can find out
who's behind it,

286
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,760
I can explain it to Mr. Wu.

287
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,230
Maybe then,

288
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,030
we can proceed with the Art Biennial.

289
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,400
Are you

290
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,670
going to give up so easily?

291
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,030
Why can't you understand?

292
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,110
From the moment my sister
made the decision to defeat me,

293
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,440
I had already lost.

294
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,590
I don't plan to become
the successor anyway.

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,880
It's good now.

296
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,280
Everyone supports Xue Zi.

297
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,960
I should just stay quiet

298
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,960
and be a useless rich kid.

299
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,670
You've worked hard
during your time here.

300
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,910
Go back.

301
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,030
But,

302
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,030
beware of my sister.

303
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,400
Wei Qing!

304
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,710
- Miss Zhou, you can't go in.
- Wei Qing!

305
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,400
- Wei Qing!
- Miss Zhou, you...

306
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,110
Let me recall

307
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,880
when was the last time

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,320
you barged into my office rudely

309
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,350
to question me.

310
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,470
So many times
that I can't even recall it now.

311
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,470
What's wrong? Tell me.

312
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,080
Why did you meet up with Xue Zi?

313
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,520
For business.

314
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,440
How do you know that?

315
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,670
None of your concern.

316
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,520
Did you meet up because of the contract?

317
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,910
Are you suspecting me?

318
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,710
I don't want to suspect you either.

319
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,760
But you always like to do things

320
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,110
behind my back.

321
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,710
If you really want me to trust you,

322
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,400
you should tell me
why you met up with Xue Zi.

323
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,790
Because of you.

324
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,760
Me?

325
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,670
You won't come back to me.

326
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,350
And you insist on working for Xue Zi.

327
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,030
I thought you were
in some kind of trouble.

328
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,470
So, I went to meet Xue Zi

329
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,710
and asked her to let go of you.

330
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,110
Let go of me?

331
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,670
Who do you think I am?

332
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,520
Do you think I'm Xue Zi's prisoner?

333
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,880
Why won't you come back then?

334
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,350
Because of you.

335
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,840
I know you are doing it for my own good.

336
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,640
But I really can't endure your way

337
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,790
of acting upon your own judgment.

338
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,910
When are you going to understand

339
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,080
that I don't need
your protection anymore?

340
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,640
No one can control my life

341
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,110
except myself.

342
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,550
Even if it's in the name of love.

343
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,470
I promise you

344
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,030
that I won't meddle
in your life anymore.

345
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,440
What was her condition?

346
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,590
What condition?

347
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,640
You asked Xue Zi to release me.

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,350
What was her condition?

349
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,840
I promised her

350
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,080
that I would make Xue Le
ruin the Art Biennial.

351
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,910
But,

352
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,910
I didn't tamper with the contact.

353
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,280
Besides, after our last fight,

354
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,280
I've realized how important

355
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,670
that Art Biennial is to you.

356
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,520
After that fight,

357
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,920
I've stopped helping Xue Zi.

358
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,710
Trust me.

359
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,950
How can I trust you?

360
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,830
I just want you to come back to me.

361
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
But by doing so,

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,520
you'll only push me further away.

363
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,280
Mr. Wei, we've received
a lawyer's letter from Wu Zheng.

364
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,110
They are going to ask Yunma and Shangjue
for compensation.

365
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,880
Zhou...

366
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,880
What should we do now?

367
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,520
Find out where Wu Zheng is.

368
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,950
I want to meet him personally.

369
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,880
Okay.

370
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,430
Dr. Chen.

371
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,310
I would like to ask
about Wei Qing's illness.

372
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,230
Will it become more serious
if there's a trauma?

373
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,760
Theoretically, it will.

374
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,110
What about physical trauma?

375
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,400
Physical trauma?

376
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,070
What happened?
Did something happen to Wei Qing?

377
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,280
Not yet.

378
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,190
He did something

379
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,470
that infuriated me.

380
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,470
I want to ask
if I can punish him or not.

381
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,110
You better don't.

382
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,190
Because his illness

383
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,160
is caused

384
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,310
by being apart from you.

385
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,640
If you want him to recover quickly,

386
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,280
you better give him more

387
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,430
warmth and comfort.

388
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,830
Do I have to appease him

389
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,400
no matter what he did wrong?

390
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,400
Well.

391
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,280
I can give you a piece of advice.

392
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,110
You can seek your revenge later.

393
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,640
Seek my revenge later?

394
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,920
I know what you mean now.

395
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,230
Are you saying

396
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,760
that I can teach him a lesson

397
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,110
after he has recovered?

398
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,190
I didn't say that.

399
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,560
Anyway, don't be too harsh on him.

400
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,560
Peace and love.

401
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,430
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Chen.

402
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,470
I'll hang up now.

403
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I'll settle the account
with you later then.

404
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,070
Wu Zheng is not abroad now.

405
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,280
It's pointless for you to go there.

406
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,310
Where is he?

407
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,830
Get in the car. I'll bring you there.

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,680
I don't need your help.

409
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,430
Just tell me where he is.
I'll go there myself.

410
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,560
You!

411
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,070
(I'll seek my revenge later.)

412
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,350
(What are you doing?)

413
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,950
I am Yunma's chairman.

414
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,070
This is such a grave matter.

415
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,830
Of course, I have to explain myself
to Wu Zheng.

416
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,760
I have to do it
to redeem Yunma's reputation

417
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,760
and prove my innocence.

418
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,070
Everything we have to say

419
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,880
is already stated clearly
in the lawyer's letter.

420
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,160
Mr. Wu won't meet you.

421
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,000
Go back.

422
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,430
We are indeed responsible for this.

423
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,800
We are here this time

424
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,590
to apologize to Mr. Wu Zheng.

425
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,590
You don't have to.

426
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,160
Please let us in.

427
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,710
There must be a misunderstanding.

428
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,190
Someone had tampered with the contract.

429
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,110
We've always respected Mr. Wu a lot.

430
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,280
We will never do anything
against his interests.

431
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,710
Let us meet him.

432
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,350
Save your words for the court.

433
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,110
Miss Zhou, when they
filed a report against you,

434
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
Mr. Wu trusted you.

435
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,230
And he regretted

436
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,430
not being able to add you to his team.

437
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,280
At first, he thought
that he could make up

438
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,230
for his regret

439
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,590
through this Art Biennial.

440
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,830
But in the end, this happened.

441
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,110
He's very disappointed in you.

442
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,040
Someone filed a report against Zhou Shi

443
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,560
to slander her.

444
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,430
The contract has nothing
to do with her too.

445
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,760
Why are you suspecting her?

446
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,680
Shut up.

447
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,640
I'm very busy now.

448
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,430
If there's nothing else,

449
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,560
I'll go back now.

450
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,310
Stop right there.

451
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,590
Stop shouting.

452
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,680
Don't panic.

453
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,280
Let's find a hotel nearby to stay in.

454
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,110
Then, we'll think of a way
to meet Wu Zheng.

455
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,350
Wei An, stop the car.

456
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,190
What are you doing?

457
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,470
Stop the car.

458
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,830
What is the meaning of this?

459
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,470
You...

460
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,760
You...

461
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,590
No.

462
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,350
Where are you doing?

463
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,560
None of your business.

464
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,830
I know that you are furious now. But,

465
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,800
this is such a remote place.

466
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,800
Let me send you back
to a hotel at least.

467
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,590
I don't need that.

468
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,350
Zhou Shi.

469
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,710
It's really you.

470
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
When did you come back?

471
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,350
I just came back two days ago.

472
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,310
The resort next to this place
wants some murals.

473
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,760
I was thinking about contacting you
within these two days.

474
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,160
I never thought
that I would run into you here.

475
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,070
Mr. Wei.

476
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,920
Hello. Please give me a room.

477
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,830
We only have one suite available now.

478
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,350
The other rooms are fully booked.

479
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,190
I'll take it.

480
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,710
Okay. Please wait for a moment.

481
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,230
I'm sorry, Miss.

482
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,230
Someone has just booked

483
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,470
this suite online.

484
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,280
So fast?

485
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,040
I booked a room just now.

486
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,280
Please help me check in.

487
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,190
Okay.

488
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,070
I was just looking it up online.

489
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,760
I didn't know that it was the last room.

490
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,760
Don't you have any more rooms?

491
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,110
I'm the one who asked
for the room first.

492
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm really sorry.

493
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,000
Our last room here

494
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,950
has already been booked
by this gentleman here.

495
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,430
Zhang Shuai.

496
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,590
Is this the only hotel here?

497
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,160
There are other hotels.
But they are in the city.

498
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,040
It'll take four hours for a round trip.

499
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,000
Sir.

500
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,070
Here's your room card.

501
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,280
I don't mind letting you stay with me.

502
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,800
I promise you

503
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,160
that I won't do anything
that you don't want to see.

504
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,680
I won't say anything
that you don't want to hear.

505
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,710
You better keep quiet then.

506
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,230
But I can't stay with you for free.

507
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,590
How about this?

508
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,160
We can split the bill.

509
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,400
That's not necessary.

510
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,470
I won't stay with you then.

511
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,590
Fine.

512
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,760
We'll split the bill.

513
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,000
You can take the main bedroom.

514
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,110
No need to do that.

515
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,160
You'll take the main bedroom.
I'll take the guest bedroom.

516
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,340
(1,000 yuan
has been transferred to you)

517
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,520
Are you really going to pay me?

518
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,640
Are you going to accept it?
I'll leave if you don't.

519
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,740
(500 yuan has been transferred to you)

520
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,310
What is the meaning of this?

521
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,880
Since I'm taking the main bedroom,

522
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,560
of course, I have to pay more.

523
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,950
If you are not going
to take advantage of me,

524
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,590
I can't take advantage of you either.

525
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,070
Childish.

526
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,470
Okay. Let's talk about

527
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,040
how we can get to Wu Zheng.

528
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,310
Okay.

529
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,880
Our biggest obstacle now

530
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
is his secretary.

531
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,110
He won't let us meet him.

532
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,190
But I don't think

533
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,000
he'll stay at home forever.

534
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,310
As long as we can find out

535
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,760
where he goes,

536
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,350
we'll be able to run into him.

537
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,920
Don't be so sure.

538
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,950
From what I know,

539
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,880
Master Wu Zheng's highest record

540
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,230
is to stay at home
for two months straight.

541
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,710
He just stayed home to draw.

542
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,470
If he's doing the same thing now,

543
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,880
we'll have to wait for a long time.

544
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,310
I don't mind waiting two months

545
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,040
together with you.

546
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,040
Mr. Wei, come to your senses.

547
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
Hurry up and come up with a way
to meet Wu Zheng.

548
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,070
Open the door.

549
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,310
Why are you here?

550
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,160
Zhang Shuai, you are here.

551
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
Come in.

552
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,880
Stop grunting. Get the luggage.

553
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,350
Come in.

554
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,230
Ignore that childish man.

555
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,310
You left in a hurry back then.

556
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,560
You didn't bring anything with you.

557
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,680
I went back not long ago.

558
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,430
The landlord

559
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,230
asked me to bring this painting to you.

560
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,000
He said

561
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,760
that he still kept the painting
that you had given him.

562
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,350
He's waiting for the value
of the painting to go up

563
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,590
when you've become a famous painter.

564
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,230
Get out!

565
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
(You are not allowed to send me food,)

566
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,000
(give me presents or flowers.)

567
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
(You are not allowed
to give me anything.)

568
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,800
But you still need
to make me feel touched.

569
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,640
Then, I'll forgive you.

570
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,800
How is it? You can't do it, right?

571
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,190
That's not difficult.

572
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,590
I promise you.

573
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,920
It's a deal then.

574
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,400
Thank you for giving
this painting back to me.

575
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,350
If you happen
to meet the landlord again,

576
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,640
tell him

577
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,710
that I don't draw anymore.

578
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,950
He can keep those paintings

579
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,110
as mementos.

580
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,190
Okay.

581
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,430
Do you mind if I sit here?

582
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,400
This is not mine.
You can sit if you want.

583
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,230
I haven't apologized to you

584
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,590
for what happened before this.

585
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,310
I have so many things to do every day.

587
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,310
I've already forgotten

588
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,760
what you did.

589
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,110
No need to apologize.

590
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,920
Has Zhou Shi ever told you

591
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,830
that when she went abroad to study,

592
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,230
we actually stayed
with the same foster family?

593
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,310
What?

594
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,590
She has never told me about it.

595
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,350
Why did you stay together?

596
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,000
Calm down first.

597
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,400
When we first went abroad,

598
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,470
we were strangers in a strange place.

599
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,950
We would always meet up to have a chat.

600
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,430
She talked about you

601
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,680
the most.

602
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
For her, you were

603
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,950
her anchor.

604
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,560
No matter how tired she was,
after she had a video call with you,

605
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,430
she would be happy for a few days.

606
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,160
Her mentor liked her very much

607
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,000
and hoped that she could stay abroad
to expand her career.

608
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,400
But she refused.

609
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,070
She said that she had to come back.

610
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,470
Because you were waiting for her.

611
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,800
After that, she got into trouble.

612
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,880
She called me and cried her eyes out.

613
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,110
She loved drawing so much.

614
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,920
Not being able to draw

615
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,560
must be such a fatal trauma for her.

616
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,190
I always thought

617
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,280
that you would be by her side.

618
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,760
I wanted to be by her side too.

619
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,310
But I couldn't find her.

620
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,710
Wei Qing.

621
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,640
I don't know what happened
between the two of you.

622
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,800
But I know

623
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,830
that Zhou Shi really loves you.

624
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,710
But the tougher she gets,

625
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,350
the more fragile this love is.

626
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,000
It takes two of you to protect it.

627
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,640
Although she always says

628
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,560
that she doesn't need anyone,

629
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,040
I know

630
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,950
that if there's someone
who she can rely on,

631
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,710
it'll be you.

632
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,800
So, I hope

633
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,160
that you can give her
the reassurance that she needs.

634
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,400
I will.

635
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,430
Okay.

636
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,040
I won't disturb you anymore then.

637
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,430
I'll get going now.

638
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,640
Thank you.

639
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,230

that keeping you by my side

702
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,160
was my greatest love to you.

703
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,950

707
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,070
I'm too selfish.

708
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,830
I'm sorry.

709
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,710

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,680

00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,190
that humans can shine?

737
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,360
Shine?

738
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,910
Do you mean being bald?

739
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,430
When Li Mingcheng plays the guitar,

740
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,760
his whole body glows up.

741
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,520
I think I can understand Rachel now.

742
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,080
Are you still the Bi Qiujing I know?

743
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,910
Are you saying

744
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,840
that you are not jealous
of Rachel anymore?

745
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,840
Getting jealous is just the first phase.

746
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,000
Now, I'm just wondering

747
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,910
why I couldn't see

748
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,230
this side of Li Mingcheng.

749
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,520
Is it because I'm blocking his light?

750
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,430
Stop.

751
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't know about blocking his light.

752
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,360
I think I need to confirm something

753
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,470
before this conversation

754
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,840
gets too difficult for me to understand.

755
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,910
Do you think that Li Mingcheng's life
has become gloomy

756
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,150
after you get
into a relationship with him?

757
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,910
You can say that.

758
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,710
Stop joking.

759
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,670
As the director of Yunma,

760
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,600
he's handsome

761
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,600
and he has married
such a smart wife like you.

762
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,470
He's in the prime of his life right now.

763
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,230
But I still think

764
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,390
that Li Mingcheng shines the brightest

765
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,520
when he's holding his guitar.

766
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,470
And the other Bi Qiujing

767
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,040
had realized this the soonest.

768
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,150
In the end, you are still jealous.

769
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,230
You are jealous
because you didn't realize

770
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,600
Li Mingcheng's strengths sooner.

771
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,320
And the other Bi Qiujing beat you to it.

772
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,710
Although it's not accurate,

773
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,950
I won't deny it.

774
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,000
Actually,
you don't have to be like this.

775
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,190
Use your intelligent brain to think.

776
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,870
No matter how brightly
Li Mingcheng shines,

777
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,470
he's still your husband.

778
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,000
Rachel should be the one to get jealous.

779
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,710
You make sense.

780
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,040
Indeed, when it comes to a relationship,

781
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,670
you are the expert.

782
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,910
Of course.

783
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,840
Or else, how can I be

784
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,430
your relationship mentor?

785
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,470
You've been married for two years.

786
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,600
Maybe now

787
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,150
is great timing for you
to make a change.

788
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,520
What change?

789
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,760
The most important thing
in a relationship

790
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,390
is to keep things interesting.

791
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,910
You've seen Li Mingcheng shine.

792
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,870
So, you should show him

793
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,600
that you can shine too.

794
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,600
But I don't know how to play guitar.

795
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,360
I can whistle.

796
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,190
This...

797
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,430
Forget it.

798
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,670
Come up with another idea.

799
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,840
Where did you go so late at night?

800
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
I finally understand.

801
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,000
This brat is exactly
the same as Ning Fei.

802
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,950
They are both ungrateful.

803
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Why am I so pretty?

804
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,600
Who allowed you to come in? Get out.

805
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,390
Fine. I'll get out.

806
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,190
I don't want to see you anyway.

807
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,150
You brat. I'm going to

808
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,760
teach you a lesson today.

809
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,360
How dare you harrumph in front of me.

810
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,560
Didn't your kindergarten teacher
teach you

811
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,910
to knock before you enter
someone's room?

812
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
I'm sorry.

813
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,430
I didn't go to a kindergarten.

814
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,910
You even talked back at me?

815
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,870
Enough, Madam. I just didn't knock.

816
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,600
Do you have to be so mad?

817
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,430
Madam? You called me madam?

818
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,760
This is for you.

819
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,000
I don't want anything from you.

820
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,870
If you break it again,

821
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,840
I won't fix it for you.

822
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,910
I went to a lot of people.
But they couldn't fix it.

823
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,230
I was so mad at it.

824
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,950
So, I fixed it myself.

825
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,670
You really fixed it yourself?

826
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,950
Of course.

so late every night?

829
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,950

What are you doing?

908
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,230

909
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,910
Come down.

910
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,910
Don't be so reckless.

911
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,800

913

915
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,520

Can you let us in?

920
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,670
What else do we have to say?

921
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,870
Leave now.

922
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,150
Or else, I'll call the police.

923
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,190
Mr. Wu, we...

924
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,080
Based on what you know about him,

925
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,150
do you know any of his weaknesses?

926
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,320
What are you plotting again?

927
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,630
We won't be able to see him ever
with your method.

928
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,000
Let's go.

929
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,230
Mr. Wu's weaknesses?

930
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,630
I know one.

931
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,950
- What is it?
- What is it?

932
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,080
His daughter, Wu Xiao.

933
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,040
Mr. Wu dotes on her a lot.

934
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,190
If she's willing to help you,

935
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,320
maybe Mr. Wu
will be willing to see you.

936
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,870
How can I forget about her?

937
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,760
She'll help us.

938
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,910
But she's abroad now.

939
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,910
She can't help us from afar.

940
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,630
She has come back.

941
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,710
I saw her in a restaurant
on the day I came back.

942
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,230
Mr. Wu brought her out for a meal.

943
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,390
So, both of you

944
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,390
should keep an eye out.

945
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Maybe you'll run into her.

946
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,840
What does he like?
What should we prepare?

947
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,230
No need to trouble yourself.

948
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,150
Having the two of you is enough.

949
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,760
- The two of us?
