00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,420
=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 15=

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,990
Greetings, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,790
Everyone, rise.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,150
Is there anything

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,890
that brings Your Majesty here?

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,330
I was just passing by,

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,300
so I came in to take a look.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,490
Li Zhi Duo.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,020
Where's the breakfast
I asked you to send over?

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,850
To reply Your Majesty,
it has been sent over already.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,450
I'm hungry as well.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,180
Let's have breakfast here.

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,620
This stewed bird's nest with rock sugar

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,290
is made by the head chef
of the Imperial Kitchen.

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,200
It's sweet but not too much.
It tastes delicious.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,600
Concubine Rong,

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,810
have a taste.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,520
I'm on a diet lately.

21
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,570
I can't eat sweet food.

22
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,000
Your Majesty, I would like to try.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,820
Take some yourself.

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,850
Why don't you try this
stir-fried bamboo shoot?

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,430
It's just the right amount of sweetness.
It tastes good as well.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,120
It's too vegetarian.
I don't want to eat it.

28
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,530
You eat it.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,360
Don't waste it.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,890
I...

31
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,130
Pour me a bowl of fish porridge.

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,690
Of course, Your Majesty.

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,800
Your Majesty, enjoy.

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,730
The fish has been deboned,

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,750
and it's not hot anymore.

36
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,450
It's the right temperature.

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,830
Here.

38
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:36,880
Try it.

39
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,960
Your Highness, have a taste.

40
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,380
I've served His Majesty
for so many years,

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,160
but this is my first time

42
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,930
seeing him take care of someone else.

43
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,060
(Fine.)

44
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,220
(Since you're so sincere,)

45
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,220
(I'll forgive you this time.)

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,980
(Wait a minute.)

47
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,600
(Qin Yu is so nice to me now.)

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,010
(If the Empress Dowager finds out,)

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,810
(she might think I can still be used.)

50
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,970
I said I don't want to eat!

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,190
You can eat by yourselves!

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,560
Your Highness!

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,290
Your Majesty!

54
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,290
Concubine Rong!

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,350
Concubine Rong!

56
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,530
Your Majesty, this...

57
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,560
Have the Imperial Kitchen
cook a new meal

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,070
and send it to her.

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,670
Your Highness, this is too biased.

61
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,300
Do I need you to tell me that?

62
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,070
His Majesty is used to being obeyed.

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,070
Do you think he treats
Concubine Rong differently

64
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,020
because he finds it interesting

65
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,800
how she always quarrels with him?

66
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,220
What you're saying seems to make sense.

67
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,820
I'll try that.

68
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,490
He's back.

69
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,020
Your Majesty,

70
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,620
you...

71
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,100
You're too mean!

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,070
You're biased toward Concubine Rong,

73
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,370
and you don't even care about me!

74
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,520
I... I don't want to eat anymore!

75
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,570
How dare you!

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,470
Disobedience towards me,
how inappropriate!

77
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,290
- Guards, take her away!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,010
No, she...!

79
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,050
Hurry up.

80
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,540
- Hurry up!
- Your Majesty, I... You...

81
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,120
Your Majesty, have mercy!

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,060
Your Majesty!

83
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,960
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

84
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,410
Your Majesty, calm down.

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,730
Your Majesty,

86
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,240
don't get angry.

87
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,820
(Ci An Palace)

88
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,440
Empress Dowager.

89
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,260
I heard that His Majesty
summoned the army generals today

90
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,080
and made deployment arrangements.

91
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,340
I presume that intel
has come in handy.

92
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,450
Initially,

93
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,410
I wanted to get some good news

94
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,990
from Concubine Rong.

95
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,680
I didn't expect that

96
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,350
not only was she of no use,

97
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,950
she even had a huge fight
with Qin Yu last night.

98
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,660
Empress Dowager,

99
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,150
I just got the news.

100
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,970
His Majesty went to
Concubine Rong's palace this morning,

101
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,210
and had breakfast with her.

102
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,390
Really?

103
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,210
(The Empress Dowager,
being late Emperor’s favorite,)

104
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,240
(should not be taken lightly.)

105
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,790
(She's more cunning than a fox.)

106
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,260
(If you're useless to her,)

107
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,570
(she'll just toss you aside.)

108
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,610
(But if she can still use you,)

109
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,650
(she'll squeeze every last drop
out of you.)

110
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,630
(It's all Qin Yu's fault
for messing things up.)

111
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,610
(What if the Empress Dowager
thinks I'm still useful,)

112
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,650
(and changes her mind?)

113
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,200
(No, I can't just sit here and wait.)

114
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:24,980
Fu Ling,

115
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,890
help me prepare some things.

116
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,030
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

117
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,480
Why are you so polite?

118
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,250
Quickly, rise. Take a seat.

119
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,740
I don't dare to.

120
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,540
Why is that?

121
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,670
I was unable to complete the task
you assigned me.

122
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,080
I feel very guilty about it.

123
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,170
I'll willingly accept the punishment.

124
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,570
Empress Dowager, please banish me
to the Cold Palace.

125
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,020
I have no complaints.

126
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,320
I thought it was something serious.

127
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,060
Is it about this small issue?

128
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,210
You're so loyal to me,

129
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,150
and we're related by blood.

130
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,970
How could I have the heart
to banish you to the Cold Palace?

131
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,300
Get up.

132
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,770
(She's being nice. As expected,
she's changed her mind.)

133
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,680
Thank you for showing mercy,
Empress Dowager.

134
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,680
I heard that yesterday,

135
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,800
His Majesty went to
your palace personally

136
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,560
to have breakfast with you.

137
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,000
Is that true?

138
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,680
Yes, Empress Dowager.

139
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,770
His Majesty is always so busy
with the state affairs

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,750
that he hardly takes care of the harem.

141
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,750
Now,

142
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,530
he's spending more time with you.

143
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,630
In the future, you'll
stay beside him,

144
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,130
and be my extra pair of ears.

145
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,390
If you hear anything
related to His Majesty,

146
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,820
come and tell me about it.

147
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,330
(Cunning old fox.)

148
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,910
(I knew this is your plan.)

149
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,520
Empress Dowager!

150
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm unable to do that!

151
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,840
Unable?

152
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,340
Empress Dowager, you're asking me

153
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,100
to spy on His Majesty for you,

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,700
but His Majesty is so sincere to me.

155
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,610
Even though I'm from a military family,

156
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,460
I still know how to
repay kindness with gratitude.

157
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,680
I will never betray his sincerity.

158
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,840
So you're saying

159
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,640
you would defy my orders

160
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,660
to protect His Majesty?

161
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,710
Empress Dowager, please
withdraw your order.

162
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,040
Do you think I won't dare to punish you?

163
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,460
I would willingly be punished

164
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,070
for His Majesty.

165
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,400
Alright.

166
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,740
Concubine Rong of the Yan family,

167
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,130
you defy the elders,
engaging in conspiracy.

168
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,310
You'll be punished with 30 hits,
and then banished to the Cold Palace.
