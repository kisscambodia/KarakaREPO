00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,420
=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 9=

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,690
What are you doing?

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,230
Stop messing around!

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,640
I...

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,470
If you want my body,

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,940
you don't have to drug me.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,661
I'll let you sleep for a night.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,240
Wait! Hold on!

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:23,770
I...

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,810
The night is short.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,590
Let's have some fun!

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,460
Your Majesty, you look tired

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,490
from all the work you've done today.

14
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,500
You should take care of your health.

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,250
It's not good to be addicted to women.

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,030
Not good at all.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,420
Being too busy with work

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,170
is exactly why I've neglected the harem.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,040
Tonight

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,190
is a good time to remedy you.

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,760
No... We can't do that!

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,610
I'm on my period!

23
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,220
If I remember correctly,

24
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,890
you said the same thing
back in Hua Qing Pool.

25
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,850
Concubine Rong,

26
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,280
you have a lot of periods recently.

27
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,570
I'm not used to the Cold Palace.

28
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,420
That's why I have hormonal imbalances.

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,620
Then, the Cold Palace

30
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,320
is not as comfortable

31
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,360
as you described before.

32
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,450
No. It's not comfortable.

33
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,530
Then, Concubine Rong, do you

34
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,360
want to live in the Cold Palace or not?

35
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,990
No. No.

36
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,450
Not anymore.

37
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,180
Since you do not feel well,

38
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,570
I will not force you

39
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,100
to sleep with me.

40
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,390
We should wait until you recover.

41
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,320
Yes. You're right.

42
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,430
Let's not talk about it now.

43
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,780
Your Majesty, it's not early.

44
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,760
I should go.

45
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,760
Li Zhi Duo!

46
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,690
I'm here.

47
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,300
Draft an edict that

48
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,300
since Concubine Rong doesn't feel well,

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,300
she's permitted

50
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,910
to return to her parents’

51
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,260
and rest there for three days.

52
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:40,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,480
(Yan's Mansion)

54
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,100
(Yan's Mansion)
Oh, my little girl,

55
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,130
I'm worried about you.

56
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,680
Our daughter has just returned.

57
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,100
Don't cry like this.

58
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,250
(Madam Yan, supporting role No. 8,
professional housewife,）

59
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,500
(de facto leader of Yan Family,
a daughter pamperer.）

60
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,570
You must be tired from your travel.

61
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,470
Come on in.

62
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,609
Right. He's right.

63
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,740
(Yan Da Hai, supporting role No. 7)
Why are you standing there? Let's go.

64
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,100
(Deputy Vanguard Grain Officer, leader
of Yan Family, a daughter pamperer.）

65
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,210
- Come in.
- Come in.

66
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,720
Hurry up.

67
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,270
Bring it on.

68
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,870
Let's see how strong your cricket is.

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,630
Don't regret later.

70
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,920
Yan Er Er, you're playing dirty.

71
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,370
Am I?

72
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,680
Let me tell you.

73
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,450
My chick

74
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,620
is named "Little Cricket".

75
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,520
Yan Er Er, eat this!

76
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,220
Young Master!

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,120
Young Master!

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,840
What's wrong?

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,920
Your sister has returned.

80
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,600
What?

81
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,130
My sister is back?

82
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,660
(Li Ren He)

83
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,260
Sorry, everyone.

84
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,530
This is the last one.

85
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,250
Why not...

86
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,090
- This is sister's favorite pear juice lollipop.
- Please come here earlier tomorrow.

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,330
Hey, be patient!

88
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:08,900
Out of my way!

89
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,790
Get out of my way!

90
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,540
Don't grab it!

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,090
This is mine!

92
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,800
Who are you? Why is this yours?

93
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,790
Yeah! We've waited here for a long time.

94
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,810
- Yeah!
- We've queued all day long!

95
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,010
What? You're not happy?

96
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,020
Then, fight me.

97
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,920
Beat him!

98
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,290
Don't fight! Don't fight!

99
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,320
Oh no! My stall!

100
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,940
Let's have more.

101
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,870
These are your favorite
meatballs with soy sauce.

102
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,520
Eat them while they're hot.

103
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,940
My daughter,

104
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,480
try this sweet and sour fish as well.

105
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,330
(I must admit,)

106
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,980
(my parents treat me really well.)

107
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,480
Sis!

108
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,150
Sis!

109
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,360
Sis!

110
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,580
Yan Er Er!

111
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,290
What's... What's wrong with you?

112
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,130
Ah, it's nothing.

113
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,300
I just fought with some people,

114
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,000
and I won.

115
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,030
Disobedient boy!

116
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,420
You only know how to cause troubles!

117
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,110
Kneel!

118
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,780
(Yan Er Er, very good at fighting,
a sister pamperer)

119
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,220
(Hah,)

120
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,910
(this guy really sticks to the script.)

121
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,690
My daughter,

122
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,510
eat first. Ignore him.

123
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,340
Come.

124
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,780
Sis.

125
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,690
Sis!

126
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:17,730
This...

127
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,010
This is...

128
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,800
Your favorite pear juice lollipop!

129
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,800
There's only one left.

130
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,370
I grabbed it for you.

131
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,680
It should be done in two hours.

132
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,210
Our daughter can have it
when she wakes up in the morning.

133
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,180
(Ah, every parent is admirable.)

134
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,990
(If it were not for their daughter,)

135
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,270
(they wouldn't be tricked
by the empress dowager)

136
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,260
(and walk on the path of no return.)

137
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,610
(After all,)

138
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,700
(it's me, the author, who caused this.)

139
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,570
(That said,)

140
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,550
(since I'm now Yan Yi Yi,)

141
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,700
(I won't let them
repeat the same mistake again.)

142
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,380
Your Majesty, the spy has sent a message

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,180
that he'll be arriving
on the outskirts of the Capital.

144
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,440
And, we've arranged

145
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,540
the time and place
for the meeting tomorrow.

146
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,860
Go and prepare.

147
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,340
I'm leaving the Palace
tomorrow.

148
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,550
But, Your Majesty,

149
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,090
this is too dangerous.

150
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,960
Just let us do that.

151
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,250
The spy

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,930
has hidden in Xirong for many years.

153
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,680
For security,

154
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,730
he always talks to me directly.

155
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,790
He trusts no one

156
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,880
other than me.

157
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,410
Besides,

158
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,580
his intel is crucial.

159
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,510
If I get the intel,

160
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,020
then I can confidently

161
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,320
win the war against Xirong.

162
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,870
If less people from the Yin Empire

163
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,970
die because I'm doing this,

164
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,750
then this is all worthwhile.

165
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,870
But...

166
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,490
There's no but.

167
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,440
Go and prepare.
