=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 21=

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,430
The Song of Wei Town?

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,490
Look at this.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,890
The people in the Capital
are interesting.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,830
They're talking about a poem

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,940
written by some random nobody.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,010
Yours.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,060
You're welcome.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,900
(The morning rains cleanse
light dusts off Wei Town.)

10
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:20,663
(The inn and green willows
put on fresh gown.)

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,780
Of wine, won't you drink
one last cup with me?

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,980
West beyond Yang Pass,
no old friends you'll see!

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,140
(Wang Wei)

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,060
(What's going on?)

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,880
(Isn't this something
I wrote for Niu?)

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,570
(Why is it being circulated?)

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,440
It's released!

18
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,560
The second poem today is Upon Passing
the Imperial Examination by Meng Jiao.

19
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,390
Riding high in the spring breeze,
off I go at full gallop.

20
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,170
To view all the flowers
of Chang'an in one day.

21
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,890
I'm surprised that
Mr. Meng's poetic prowess

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,220
is not below Mr. Wang's.

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,410
I know, right?

24
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,290
The Imperial Examination
hasn't even started yet,

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,090
he's already celebrating
his success.

26
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,670
You should talk less.

27
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,380
Better not come the third poem.

28
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,160
The third poem is released!

29
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,430
The third poem is released!

30
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,810
Really?

31
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,130
Come here and take a look.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,530
Here you go!

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,770
Alas, the Capital

34
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,660
is filled with talents.

35
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,360
I was too naive

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,280
to have looked down upon
these great poets.

37
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,700
Don't think like that.

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,540
These are great writers
spanned across 5,000 years of history.

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,970
Why are you comparing yourself to them?

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,170
Brother Yue, don't try to comfort me.

41
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,690
I'm sparsely educated,

42
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,050
and still need a lot of practice,

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,040
I shouldn't embarrass myself here.

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,880
I came here

45
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,620
for the sole purpose of
taking the top spot.

46
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,440
But now, I can't even
make it into the top ten,

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,120
let alone the top one?

48
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,250
Since this is the case,

49
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,930
it's better for me to return,

50
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,540
and practice for another ten years.

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,060
Brother Wen Chang!

52
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,570
Brother Wen Chang!

53
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,060
Please think twice.

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,940
Both of you,
I've made up my mind.

55
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,460
Stop persuading me to stay.

56
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,360
Goodbye.

57
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
It's late.

58
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,160
I should go back.

59
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,780
Watch him very closely.

60
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,320
Don't let him read these poems again.

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,710
Goodbye, Brother Yue.

62
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,640
Your Majesty, you should rest earlier.

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,270
Our country is having the
Imperial Examination soon.

64
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,240
I have a lot of work to do.

65
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,670
Let me go through more of these.

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,240
Oh right,

67
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,810
how's Concubine Rong?

68
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,280
Your Majesty,

69
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,920
Concubine Rong is
not feeling well today.

70
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,840
I heard that she has caught a cold.

71
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,990
Cold?

72
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,490
Your Highness, you're back!

73
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,770
Your Highness, you're finally back!

74
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,460
Yes, I'm back.

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,090
Fu Ling!

76
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,120
Little Six!

77
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,330
Your Highness, you're finally back!

78
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,480
Here comes His Majesty!

79
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,460
His Majesty?

80
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,960
Go!

81
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,730
Just go!

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

83
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,640
Eunuch, how dare you

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,020
run instead of greeting His Majesty?

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,550
Such misbehavior.

86
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,850
Greetings, Your Majesty.

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,990
Rise.

88
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

89
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,840
I came across this place,

90
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,020
and heard that Concubine Rong is sick.

91
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,480
That's why I'm checking on her.

92
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,440
How are you feeling?

93
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

94
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,710
I...

95
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm fine.

96
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,630
Fine?

97
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,420
Your voice has changed.

98
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,330
Your Majesty,

99
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,480
Her Highness has been
coughing a little today.

100
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,140
That is why

101
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,990
her voice is a little coarse now.

102
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,940
You're coughing.
How dare you say you're fine?

103
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,990
Li Zhi Duo,
summon the Imperial Physician.

104
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

105
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,470
There's no need.

106
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,170
Why?

107
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,700
Because I'm feeling much better

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,010
after seeing you.

109
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,520
That's why I don't need
to see a physician.

110
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,990
The Cold Palace

111
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,270
is not a place to stay for long.

112
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,710
I don't understand

113
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,760
why you insist on staying here.

114
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,730
Really, why are you doing this?

115
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,690
Your Majesty may not know that

116
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,620
I'm doing this

117
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,720
for you.

118
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,110
For me?

119
