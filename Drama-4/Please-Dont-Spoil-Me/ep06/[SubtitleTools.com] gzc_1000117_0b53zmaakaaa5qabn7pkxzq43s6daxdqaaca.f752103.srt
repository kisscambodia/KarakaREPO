=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 6=

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,150
Hoeing in the paddy
under the mid-day sun.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,610
Sweat dripping to the soil
underneath the plant.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,360
Stop!

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,270
(Lan Xin Palace)
Who knows that the meals in our plates,

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,300
every morsel of them
comes with toil and pains.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,960
I awake light-hearted
this morning of spring.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,710
Everywhere around me
the birds are singing.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,090
Why do they keep
repeating the first half?

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,360
Where's the other half?

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,160
I awake light-hearted
this morning of spring.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,860
Everywhere around me
the birds are singing.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,420
Greetings, Eunuch Niu.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,630
You are...?

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,020
Niu De Yi, at your service.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,850
Greetings, Concubine Rong.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,940
Eunuch Niu, it's a pleasure to meet you.

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,240
Your Highness, what...?

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,170
There's nothing much for me to do

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,420
here in the Cold Palace.

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,550
I've read a few poems,

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,870
so I asked them to recite with me.

23
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,240
Sorry you had to see that, Eunuch Niu.

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,560
Your Highness, you're too humble.

25
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,050
The poem I heard just now,

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,410
"Hoeing in the paddy
under the mid-day sun."

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,210
Although the words are simple,

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,440
the meaning is profound,
wonderful and extraordinary.

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,210
But this "Everywhere around me
the birds are singing.",

30
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,740
is there a second half?

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,450
Eunuch, you're right on time.

32
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,740
I just thought of the other half.

33
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,240
Listen to this.

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,920
I remembered the storm
that blew in the night,

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,870
and I wonder how many
blossoms had fallen.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,220
What do you think?

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,170
Oh, my.

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,340
I awake light-hearted
this morning of spring.

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,860
Everywhere around me
the birds are singing.

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,170
I remembered the storm
that blew in the night,

41
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,830
and I wonder how many
blossoms had fallen.

42
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,480
The first half is enjoying the spring,

43
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,870
and the second half
is cherishing the spring.

44
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,460
Love and cherish.

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,350
Cherishing the spring
is loving the spring.

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,310
Wonderful!

47
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,900
I have a few more poems inside.

48
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,550
If you're interested,

49
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,750
you can take a look at them.

50
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,220
How wonderful!

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,620
These are what poems should look like.

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,520
How wonderful!

53
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,730
This is what food should look like.

54
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,660
Eunuch, we should be heading back.

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,090
Oh, Your Highness,

56
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,020
I didn't realize I took up

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,520
so much of your time.

58
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,080
What a sin that is.

59
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,380
That's okay.

60
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,100
If you don't mind,

61
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,230
you can come over whenever you want.

62
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,540
Don't worry, Your Highness.

63
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,130
Next time I drop by,

64
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,570
I won't come empty-handed.

65
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,740
(Beautiful mountain view)

66
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,940
That's not right. I won't be able to

67
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,230
stay alive in the Cold Palace
for a hundred days.

68
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,090
Yan Yi Yi was banished to
the Cold Palace on June 1st.

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,430
On September 10th,
the Yan family was beheaded.

70
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,340
(Yan Da Hai)
Yan Yi Yi was killed in the Cold Palace.

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,760
But the day of my time-traveling

72
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,020
was June 1st.

73
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,460
I didn't drug Qin Yu that day.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,470
The matter was then
delayed for a few days.

75
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,220
Today is June 5th.

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,410
Book Officer, come out!

77
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,900
(99 days 11 hours 37 minutes 18 seconds)

78
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,660
You've been in the Cold Palace
for 12 hours 23 minutes.

79
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,680
The time remaining is

80
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,930
99 days 11 hours 37 minutes.

81
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,880
What if I end up being killed

82
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,540
in the Cold Palace
without reaching a hundred days?

83
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,380
Then that's game over.

84
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,980
You would cease to exist in both worlds.

85
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,850
Your Highness!

86
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,210
Your Highness.

87
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,550
(I cannot just sit and wait for death.)

88
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,790
Fu Ling, get me a brush and some ink.

89
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,660
What did you say?

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,290
You mean

91
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,060
Concubine Rong is eating and
sleeping well in the Cold Palace,

92
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,680
and has even assembled a poetry group,

93
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,600
chatting away with Niu De Yi?

94
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,960
Your Majesty, I saw it with my own eyes.

95
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,590
Everything I'm saying is true.

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,230
Are you sure she's that capable?

97
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,130
If you said she could subdue
a few palace maids and eunuchs,

98
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,020
I'd still believe you.

99
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,040
Writing poetry?

100
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,860
She doesn't even know how to read.

101
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,510
What a joke.

102
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,740
Your Majesty,

103
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,650
I heard it very clearly.

104
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,610
I even made a copy of it.

105
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,100
Your Majesty, take a look.

106
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,380
(Chu River has become five.
Where does the dry land go to the soil?)

107
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,050
Chu River has become five.

108
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,180
Where does the dry land go to the soil?

109
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,700
What rubbish is this?

110
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,330
Wei Liu eats it for nothing.

111
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,940
You can pick apricots and eat it.

112
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,970
Such nonsense.

113
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,840
How is this poetry?

114
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,940
Your Majesty,

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,800
every single word here
was heard with my own ears.

116
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,250
It is correct.

117
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
How pretentious.

118
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,610
Continue observing her.

119
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,820
If there's anything new,

120
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,790
report to me.

121
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,620
(To my dear parents)
(Respectfully, your daughter)

123
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,650
Help me send this letter.

124
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,450
You must hand it over
to my parents personally.

125
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:57,950
Do you hear me?

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,990
Don't worry, Your Highness.

127
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,940
Have a taste.

128
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,620
Are you blind?

129
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,990
Was that a thief?

130
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,800
I knew you didn't have the guts

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,910
to steal from me.

132
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,060
(To my dear parents)

133
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,800
Why is it you again?

134
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,480
You've bumped into me twice already!

135
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,190
You're doing this on purpose!

136
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,830
Oh, no!

137
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,250
The letter!

138
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,860
Thank God.

139
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,060
(Yan Residence)

140
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,180
Stop turning in circles.

141
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,100
Have you even thought of a plan

142
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,230
to save our daughter?

143
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,030
Your daughter messed up so badly.

144
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,400
What can I do about it?

145
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,940
My daughter?

146
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,200
Is she not your daughter?

147
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,280
Yes, yes, she's my daughter.

148
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,790
Then hurry up and think of a way.

149
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,910
If all else fails,

150
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,450
let's send some money.

151
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,500
When other families' kids
make a mistake,

152
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,590
that's what they usually do, right?

153
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,490
Yi Yi made His Majesty angry.

154
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,710
Do you think his Majesty

155
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,720
would care for the little
money you have?

156
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,340
You...

157
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,710
You yelled at me.

158
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,550
You yelled at me!

159
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,320
I... I didn't!

160
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,140
You're really something, Yan Da Hai.

161
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,210
You can't think of a way.

162
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,270
All you know is to vent
your frustrations out on me.

163
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,500
Now that I can't save our daughter,

164
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,710
I don't want you anymore!

165
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,840
Calm down, my dear, calm down.

166
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,080
Now is not the time to cry.

167
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,450
We have to think of a way

168
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,940
to save our daughter.

169
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,700
My dear,

170
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,300
it's my fault.

171
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,310
Stop crying, stop crying.

172
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,340
Okay?

173
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,850
If all else fails,

174
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,770
I'll go and beg Her Grace.

175
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,590
We're still relatives after all.

176
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,820
Consort Li is
Her Grace's niece.

177
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,120
You're such a distant relative.

178
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,060
What use is that?

179
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,170
This... This won't work,
and that won't work either.

180
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,990
Then you think of a way!

181
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,940
I have a way!

182
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,330
♪Listen to the sound of tides♪

183
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,520
♪They are saying I do♪

184
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,100
♪The setting sun is listening
