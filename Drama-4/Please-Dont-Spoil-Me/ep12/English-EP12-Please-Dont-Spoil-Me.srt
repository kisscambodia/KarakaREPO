00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,420
=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 12=

2
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,530
Finally, I'm back.

3
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,370
No.

4
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,310
Not everything is done yet.

5
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,290
I haven't gone back to the Cold Palace.

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,400
I've travelled here for a week,

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,480
but I've only stayed in the Cold Palace
for a day.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,730
I still have 99 days to go.

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,330
If that's the case,

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,590
when can I go back to the real world?

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,760
Qin Yu is to blame for this.

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,890
Is he back?

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,440
He should be fine, right?

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,570
Fu Ling, go and ask His Majesty

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,750
how he's doing today.

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,460
I heard from others that

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,340
His Majesty may not be
feeling well today.

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,120
Not feeling well?

19
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,150
This shouldn't happen!

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,620
Mr. Xue's prescription

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,410
should be working well!

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,550
No way. I have to check on him myself.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,040
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,650
Concubine Rong has requested to see you.

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,120
Concubine Rong?

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,240
What's she doing here?

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,240
She said she's here to greet you.

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,580
But since you're not feeling well,

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,280
how about

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,140
I politely ask her to leave?

31
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,730
No need.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,420
She's here to help the empress dowager
obtain information from me.

33
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,680
Let her in.

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,930
Your Majesty, Concubine Rong is here.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,760
You've just returned
to the Palace from your parents',

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,590
and you want to meet me.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,410
What's this for?

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,140
I heard that you're not feeling well.

41
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
That's why I came.

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,340
I just caught a cold.

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,680
The Imperial Physician prescribed me
some medicines. I should be fine soon.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,180
There's no need for you to worry.

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,000
(Just continue pretending.)

46
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,400
(Cold my foot!)

47
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,090
- Your Majesty!
- Your...

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,140
Are you okay?

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,740
Your Majesty, are you alright?

50
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,210
I'm fine.

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
If you have nothing else to say,

52
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,780
you should leave.

53
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,190
Noted.

54
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,530
I'll leave now.

55
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,320
You've not cherished
my good intentions.

56
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,580
You even made a face
when I tried to show care to you.

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,810
Being poisoned doesn't make you entitled
to everything!

58
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,650
Never mind.

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,770
This is my responsibility, after all.

60
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,210
Fu Ling.

61
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,310
Go find some herbs

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,340
according to this prescription.

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,860
(Hui Liu Investigation)

64
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,210
Your Grace,

65
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,330
about the incident that happened
in the suburban bamboo forest,

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,290
I've done the necessary investigations.

67
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,260
The people who initiated the attacks

68
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,290
were from Xirong,

69
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,680
and His Majesty is their target.

70
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,560
His Majesty has installed a spy

71
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,820
in Xirong for many years.

72
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,060
And now, he's got the valuable intel.

73
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,850
If Qin Yu

74
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,900
gets another useful intel,

75
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,190
then we would be in

76
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,690
an even more disadvantaged position.

77
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,810
Yesterday, I went to rescue him.

78
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,500
And today, I'm cooking him medicines.

79
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,000
Yan Yi Yi,

80
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,300
why are you doing all these?

81
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,220
If I don't enter the Cold Palace,
I'll be eliminated.

82
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,730
Your Highness, Granny Wang has requested
to see you.

83
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,760
Greetings, Concubine Rong.

84
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,030
Her Grace heard that you're back.

85
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,010
She sent me to invite you over.

86
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,860
Your Highness, please.

87
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,630
Okay. Let's go!

88
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,080
(This old lady)

89
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,660
(surely has no good intention in mind.)

90
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,690
(I don't know what she's trying to do
this time.)

91
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,340
(I have to be careful.)

92
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,180
I'm very concerned

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,700
about something recently.

94
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:22,840
Please tell me.

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,370
You do know that

96
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,160
Yin Empire and Xirong have been in war
for many years

97
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,080
to no avail.

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,330
But today,

99
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,570
His Majesty seems to have got
some intel from an unknown source.

100
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,280
And this intel seems to be related
to the frontline warfare.

101
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,580
I'm worried that His Majesty
may fall into the enemy's trap

102
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,300
for being too eager to win the war.

103
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,740
But I can't tell him that directly.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
After some thoughts,

105
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,040
I think I should ask for your help.

106
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,720
I...

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,110
♪Listen to the sound of tides♪

108
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,300
