=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 20=

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,350
Is this the eunuch from the Cold Palace?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,280
Where's Little Six?

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,420
Little Six is not feeling well today.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,500
I'll be replacing him for a day.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,500
Replacing him for a day?

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,250
Why am I not notified of this?

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,450
You're making our work very difficult.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,150
This is a little gift for you.

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,790
I hope you can accept it.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,730
Go ahead.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,220
Let them go!

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,820
Thank you.

14
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:31,730
Go on.

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,400
I look pretty good!

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:54,890
Sugar figurine!

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:55,900
Sugar figurine!

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,770
Sir, how much is your sugar figurine?

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,620
It's 10 pennies for a stick.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,930
If you can complete poems with me,

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,320
then you can take these for free.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,140
People in the Capital are weird.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,310
This is a sure way to lose money.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,690
Brother Qian.

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,100
The stall owner wants to
meet new friends through poetry.

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,610
He's a man of culture.

27
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,040
He's not like you

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,330
who thinks everything in terms of money.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,750
Brother Wen Chang, you should try it.

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,420
Yes.

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,680
You should try it!

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,510
Come on. Show us what you got!

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,720
Please.

34
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,420
Then, do allow me to try it.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,820
A bridge of moonlight spans
across a thousand miles.

36
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,240
I'll say "as the plants show a thousand
miles of green during the autumn."

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,610
What a great poem!

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,580
I have another one.

39
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,550
I'm wondering if you can
complete this poem too.

40
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,800
The clouds appear beneath
the morning sun every day.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,800
Sir, listen carefully.

42
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,540
It's the clouds appear beneath
the morning sun every day,

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,790
but they will just come and go
as the day goes by.

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,360
He's not wrong!

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,480
He wrote, just like the tide that rises

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,090
and disappears.
He's not wrong at all.

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,750
Have a look.

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,900
(The clouds come and go, just like
the tide that rises and disappears.)

49
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,540
This is great! Just like I said,

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,740
you'll surely rank top

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,310
in the upcoming Imperial Examination.

52
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,460
Right!

53
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,170
Brother Qian, I'm flattered.

54
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,630
Brother,

55
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,640
you're able to decipher
the meaning of my poem.

56
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,100
This proves your poetry skills
are at least on par with mine.

57
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,110
Ah, no way this is true.

58
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,570
I'm Xu Wen Chang. Nice to meet you.

59
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,370
And I'm Yue Chuan.

60
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,190
Brother Yue, greetings.

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,990
Wait a minute.

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,000
Xu Wen Chang?

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
You're that Xu Wen Chang?

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,280
(Xu Wen Cheng,)

65
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,120
(a great scholar.)

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,260
(He's the kind of child
every parent wants to have.)

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,020
Brother Yue, do you know me?

68
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,110
Of course I do!

69
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,780
You will rank first
in the upcoming Imperial Examination!

70
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,410
It's my honor to meet you.

71
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,140
Brother Yue, I'm flattered.

72
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,080
Although I want to be ranked first,

73
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,260
the Imperial Examination
has yet to start.

74
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,260
You've surely congratulated me
too early.

75
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,420
Believe me.

76
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
You'll rank top in
the upcoming Imperial Examination.

77
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,480
Brother Yue is really confident

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,610
about my abilities.

79
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,150
Of course!

80
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,510
(You're the best scholar)

81
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,560
(in my novel. The smartest one.)

82
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,700
(I'm really happy to meet him here.)

83
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,970
(I can't miss this opportunity.)

84
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,930
Oh right, have you guys had your meal?

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,220
How about

86
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,790
we find a place to chat and eat?

87
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,460
(Zui Xiao Restaurant)

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,490
Brother Yue, let me introduce you

89
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,960
to Zhou Ren, or Brother Zhou.

90
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,630
Nice to meet you.

91
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,970
And this is Qian Si Xian,
or Brother Qian.

92
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,160
These two are my classmates.

93
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,480
We're here

94
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,880
for the Imperial Examination.

95
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,220
To be honest,

96
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,030
I've studied for 15 years

97
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,880
for the sole purpose

98
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,330
of passing the Imperial Examination
to serve His Majesty

99
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,120
and this country.

100
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,900
Although there are many great scholars

101
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,210
who are attending

102
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,010
the upcoming Imperial Examination,

103
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,330
I'm confident about my abilities.

104
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,890
I am determined to get the top rank.

105
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,160
How inspiring! Let's have another drink!

106
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,730
Cheers!

107
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,420
Cheers!

108
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,130
Cheers!

109
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,930
Cheers!

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,100
It's released!

111
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,930
The first poem of today is
the Song of Wei Town by Wang Wei.

112
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,750
Share it with me.

113
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,270
The Song of Wei Town?

114
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:03,086
♪Listen to the sound of tides♪

115
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,570
♪They are saying I do♪

116
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,820
♪The setting sun is listening
to your whispers♪

117
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:15,414
♪I have told you too many of my secrets♪

118
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,226
♪I am being too sweet♪

119
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:22,008
♪The whole galaxy is shining for you♪
