=Episode 24=

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,460
Sir, have a drink.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,240
Thanks.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,490
During the poetry party today,

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,420
you came up with three great poems.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,200
I admire your poetry skills.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,700
Oh, right.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,840
I have a friend called Xu Wen Chang.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,690
He has a great personality,
and is a good poet too.

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,350
He's also passed the Imperial
Examination at lower level twice.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,820
I believe he'll rank first
in the Imperial Examination this year.

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,540
How about I introduce you to him?

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,400
You and I are having a great time now.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,280
Why are you mentioning another guy?

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,420
Besides,

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,340
if the person is as good
as you described him to be,

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,460
then,

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,090
why wasn't he here
for the poetry party?

19
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,270
He was the one
who was supposed to go onstage.

20
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,840
According to my novel,

21
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,080
Xu Wen Chang won against Yu Wen Bai
in the poetry party,

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,260
and obtained a better reputation
as a result.

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,550
And then, Qin Yu heard about him,

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,920
and invited him
to support the new policy.

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,480
With his assistance,
Yu Wen Xun's scheme failed.

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,460
Now that I took his place,

27
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,120
how will the plot develop?

28
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,600
Sir, what's wrong?
Is something troubling you?

29
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,530
I don't want to talk about it.
It's making me anxious.

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,980
Tea makes you less anxious,
and alcohol makes you less depressed.

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,490
Have some tea. You'll feel better.

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,390
I don't want to.

33
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,960
Have some.

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,460
No.

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,520
Just a cup will do.

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,210
No, thanks.

37
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,320
- Sorry. Sorry.
- I'm fine.

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,030
Let me do it myself.

39
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,510
- You!
- Ah!

40
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,200
Your Highness, I have him.

41
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,720
Wow, he's really my true love.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,660
The more I look at him,
the more I like him.

43
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,050
Take him home.

44
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,810
Yes, Your Highness!

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,750
Your Highness, please stop!

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,090
You eunuch,

47
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,020
what are you doing?

48
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,360
Do you want to take him away from me?

49
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,750
Not him, but me.

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,250
I want this person.

51
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,090
Brother,

52
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,140
what do you want with him?

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,160
I should be the one asking.

54
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,260
What do you want to do?

55
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,750
This is my true love.

56
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,620
Don't stop me.

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,200
True love?

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,000
You've made a mistake. This person is...

59
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,150
Is what?

60
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,040
It doesn't matter.

61
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,110
Go find your true love elsewhere.

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,000
I need

63
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,760
this person for something.

64
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,150
For something?

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,490
Let the person go.

66
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,470
Brother, you're bullying me!

67
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,370
You're such a troublemaker.

68
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,050
You two,

69
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,800
bring Concubine Rong back.

70
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

71
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,290
Zhao Xiao Wu,

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,470
after sending her back,
help me investigate something.

73
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,590
You know what it is.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,200
Understood.

75
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,270
Sorry, Sir.

76
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,320
I'm Xu Wen Chang. Greetings.

77
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,210
You're the one who passed the Imperial
Examination at lower level twice.

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,720
Sir, you know me?

79
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,030
I heard that you may pass
the third time this year.

80
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,120
Since you have the will,

81
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,200
you should spend more time
preparing for the examination.

82
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,680
You seem to be drinking
and enjoying yourself

83
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,400
a little too much.

84
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
You don't understand.

85
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,730
You don't understand!

86
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,660
(Yu Wen's Residence)

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,040
Useless!

88
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,830
You can't even do
such a simple thing.

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,440
Why should I still keep you around?

90
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,840
Uncle, please calm down.

91
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,080
Something unexpected happened today.

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,410
I've already contacted many scholars

93
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,260
who will pass on the message

94
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,310
to openly criticize the new policy.

95
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,650
Starting from tomorrow onward,

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,380
the scholars in the city

97
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,950
will openly be against the new policy.

98
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,320
It's not enough.

99
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,130
His Majesty is very determined

100
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,300
to implement the new policy.

101
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,210
We have to pressure him harder.

102
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,860
(Lan Xin Palace)

103
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,630
My neck is a little sore.

104
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,670
Was I possessed by a ghost?

105
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,820
No way.

106
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,780
I wrote an ancient drama,

107
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,140
not a supernatural one.

108
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,800
Never mind.

109
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,570
It's not the time to think about this.

110
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,640
Your Highness.

111
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,760
Your Highness.

112
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,920
I heard that

113
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,340
many scholars in the city

114
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,960
are openly discussing the new policy.

115
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,200
They seem to be opposing the policy.

116
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,800
So it's happening.

117
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,370
A moment please!

118
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,410
(It's time for an update!)

119
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,540
Who are you?

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,940
(Decree)

121
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,020
If you kill me,

122
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,060
you'll be in trouble.

123
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,260
I've caught the assassin.

124
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
You're openly

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,610
opposing Empress Dowager.

126
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,560
Why are you arresting me?

127
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,550
Today,

128
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,200
I'll punish her with
the Ming capital punishment.

129
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,390
I've never

130
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,450
liked you in a romantic way.

131
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,100
