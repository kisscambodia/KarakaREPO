=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 5=

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,700
You're the one who hit Consort Li?

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,250
Yes, that's me.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,650
Why?

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,190
No reason.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,590
I can't stand her.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,210
Concubine Rong,

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,950
you are to return to your palace

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,380
and grounded for three days.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,370
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,110
assaulting someone superior in the harem

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,330
should at least be banished
to the Cold Palace for three months.

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,060
How can it be this simple?

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,870
That's right.

15
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,650
Oh,

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,160
you can add another ten days.

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,050
Three day is enough for her to reflect.

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,400
She will learn from her mistake.

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,310
Your Majesty, this won't do.

20
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,970
Your Majesty, this won't do.

21
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,860
I'm a pretty stubborn person.

22
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,080
If you punish me lightly this time,

23
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,960
I'll dare to do it again next time.

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,540
If it happens again,

25
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,490
we'll deal with it then.

26
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,950
Your Majesty, please think twice.

27
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,850
I've already decided!

28
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,520
You may leave.

29
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,400
I'll take my leave.

30
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,400
Your Majesty,

31
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,180
won't you give it some more thought?

32
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,680
Why?

33
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,520
You want to resist my order?

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,300
You may leave.

35
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,240
Your Highness,

36
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,510
this is His Majesty's favorite vase.

37
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,470
If this vase shatters,

38
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,060
His Majesty is really going to be angry.

39
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,810
(Favorite?)

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,260
Let me help you!

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,030
Your Majesty!

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,340
That is my favorite vase!

43
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,400
Guards!

44
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,640
Banish her to the Cold Palace!

45
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,020
(Lan Xin Palace)

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,680
We're going to spend our days
in such place?

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,970
Eunuch,

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
can we have another palace?

50
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,510
Your Highness!

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,510
You guys...!

52
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,490
Open the door, you guys!

53
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,870
If you have the guts, then don't go!

54
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,420
Open the door!

55
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,620
Your Majesty,

56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,720
didn't you say you weren't going
to punish Concubine Rong?

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,150
You wanted to take the initiative.

58
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:24,700
Why?

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,900
Did you think I lost my ability
to make a clear judgment

60
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,810
because of a vase?

61
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,910
I would not dare to.

62
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,010
Concubine Rong

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,920
is trying everything she can
to enter the Cold Palace,

64
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,250
which means there's something in there

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,180
that is very important to her.

66
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,350
I've decided to let things
go with the flow,

67
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,080
and observe her in secret

68
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,620
after she entered the Cold Palace.

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,420
I want to know

70
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,550
why she wants to enter
the Cold Palace so badly.

71
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,580
Your Majesty is so wise.

72
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,010
Observe everything she does.

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,230
Report immediately if something is off.

74
00:02:59,470 --> 00:02:59,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,760
Your Majesty.

76
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,870
Then,

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,570
what... What should
we do with this vase?

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,640
Bury it.

79
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,650
Eunuch.

81
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,010
Which palace is the Concubine
from this time?

82
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,880
Who cares which palace she's from?

83
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,150
Once you're in the Cold Palace,

84
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,810
it doesn't matter how favored you were.

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
Congratulations on being banished
to the Cold Palace.

86
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,970
The plot is back on track.

87
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,270
Your risk of being eliminated
is temporarily gone.

88
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,830
What do you mean?

89
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,310
Why is it temporary?

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,790
Once you leave the Cold Palace,

91
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,600
the risk of being eliminated remains.

92
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,220
Don't worry. I'm never going out.

93
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,280
Your hundred days
in the Cold Palace starts now.

94
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,820
(99 days 23 hours 59 minutes 10 seconds)
It's starting.

95
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,760
In a hundred days,

96
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,250
I can go home.

97
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,780
A hundred-day journey
begins with a single step.

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,640
Good luck.

99
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,540
Your Highness, this place
is too broken down.

100
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,660
How can anyone stay here?

101
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,900
Don't worry.

102
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,010
It's just a little broken.

103
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,430
It'll be better after we
get someone to clean it up.

104
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,510
Do it yourself.

105
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,670
How dare you!

106
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,540
How can you speak
to Her Highness like this?

107
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,120
Do you still think
you're the master here?

108
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,670
A phoenix without its feathers
is just a chicken.

109
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,710
Don't you know that?

110
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,160
You...!

111
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,150
What is your name?

112
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,810
I have nothing to hide.

113
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,700
People call me

114
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,090
Sixth Eunuch.

115
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,910
Little Six.

116
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,300
Eunuch in charge of
the Cold Palace guard.

117
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,540
Likes to steal.

118
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,940
Little Six.

119
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,150
What Little Six?

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,210
I'm Sixth Eunuch.

121
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,040
Yes, of course. Sixth Eunuch,
your reputation precedes you.

122
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,530
Oh, by the way,

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,990
is all the jewelry that you sewed

124
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,810
into your quilt doing okay?

125
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,170
How do you know that?

126
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,960
It doesn't matter how I know that.

127
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,540
But once the noble people
who lost those jewelry find out...

128
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,490
Your Highness, please lower your voice.

129
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,680
I have no choice

130
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,170
but to do those things.

131
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,510
I know.

132
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,510
You have to take care of
your 80-year-old grandmother.

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,170
You're earning too little
in the palace,

134
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,410
so you were forced to

135
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,860
pick up that bad habit.

136
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,400
You know that too?

137
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,670
There are many other things I know.

138
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,370
There are...

139
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,230
There are?

140
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,360
Your Highness,

141
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,790
please keep this secret for me.

142
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,580
I can keep this secret for you,

143
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,120
but...

144
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,510
Understood.

145
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,570
(Beautiful mountain view)
Make sure the plaque is spotless!

146
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,780
Those who are sweeping the ground,
work harder!

147
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,270
Don't be lazy!

148
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,390
Move your hands and feet!

149
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,770
If I see a speck of dust anywhere,

150
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,850
you'll be answering to me!

151
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,790
Be careful with that!

152
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,210
Don't break it!

153
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,910
Your Highness,

154
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,110
how do you know his secret?

155
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,840
You don't know.

156
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,990
This is the power of the author.

157
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,140
Wow.

158
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,720
Now that it's cleaned up,
the Cold Palace

159
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,100
is even more comfortable
than Concubine Rong Palace.

160
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,220
Your Highness,

161
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,420
I've asked them to wash both quilts.

162
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,940
The weather is good today.

163
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,650
The quilts will dry soon
and you can use them at night.

164
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,160
Thanks for your hard work, Sixth Eunuch.

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,640
Not at all.

166
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,580
Your Highness, just call me Little Six.

167
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,040
Food is here!

168
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,160
Your Highness, this is your lunch.

169
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,410
What is this?

170
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,500
This is

171
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,780
porridge.

172
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,090
What porridge?

173
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,130
How can there be such a thin porridge?

174
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,880
Did you do this on purpose?

175
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,340
Who's in charge of the food here?

176
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,780
To reply Your Highness,

177
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,040
Eunuch Niu is in charge.

178
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,850
Niu De Yi.

179
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,360
Professional old eunuch.

180
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,220
(Niu De Yi, 27th supporting role)
Poetry and song enthusiast.

181
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,880
I've got a plan.

182
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,270
When does Old Niu come here?

183
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,640
To reply Your Highness,

184
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,440
Eunuch Niu's duty is
to inspect the Cold Palace.

185
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,610
He will pass by

186
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,890
every afternoon.

187
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,280
Then, all of you listen to me.
