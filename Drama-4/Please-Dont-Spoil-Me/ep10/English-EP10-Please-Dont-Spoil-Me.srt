=Episode 10=

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,490
Sis!

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,320
This is good, right?

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,420
Much more crowded

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,750
than in the Palace, I suppose.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,870
Not bad, indeed.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,700
Sis,

8
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,100
do you like candied haws?

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,360
Sure, give me some.

10
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,020
Wait for me.

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,100
Sis,

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,610
what about you not going back
to the Palace?

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,010
If you stay at home,

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,130
you can play with me all the time.

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,960
How old are you?

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,380
Why do you still need your sister
to play with you?

17
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,730
(That said,)

18
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,920
(were it not for the hundred-day
staying in the Cold Palace,)

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,900
(staying here is indeed
better than in the Palace.)

20
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,230
(But, if I don't go back
to the Cold Palace in time,)

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,280
(I'll be eliminated in god-knows-when.)

22
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:51,620
(No.)

23
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,460
(I need to come up with some plans.)

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,100
Sis?

25
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:56,620
Nothing.

26
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:58,075
Let's go.

27
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,190
Let me bring you to a restaurant.

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,790
Let's go.

29
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,100
OK.

30
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,220
(Zui Xiao Restaurant)

31
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,690
Stop mess things around,

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,680
and start doing good things
and being a good person.

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,080
Understand?

34
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,500
Doing good things?

35
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,720
I'm better at messing things around.

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,630
I'm not experienced
in doing good things.

37
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,940
What experience do you need
for doing good things?

38
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,260
Helping others is a source of happiness!

39
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,300
Helping... A source of happiness?

40
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:27,940
Go away!

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,770
Go! Go away!

42
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,560
You're being very rude!

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,030
Go away!

44
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,450
If you don't have money,
don't come here and drink!

45
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,620
Let me teach you.

46
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,340
Look.

47
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,240
Old pal, come and sit with us!

48
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,120
Don't be shy!

49
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,670
Me?

50
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,970
Yeah!

51
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,890
Come here! Come.

52
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,760
You, sit there.

53
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,640
Go.

54
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,080
Lady,

55
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,770
you're generous.

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,150
The waiter

57
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,820
judged me wrongly.

58
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,650
He thought I'm a beggar,

59
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,540
and even tried to drive me away.

60
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,440
Isn't that infuriating?

61
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,270
Old pal,

62
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
aren't you a beggar?

63
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,220
How can you talk like this?

64
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,880
Ignore him.

65
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,560
Come and drink.

66
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,270
Cheers!

67
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,720
Can I have another one?

68
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,880
Sure. No problem!

69
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,570
It's rare to meet someone so generous.

70
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't

71
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,060
drink these without repaying you.

72
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,250
It is fate that we met.

73
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,680
Come.

74
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,520
Let's have another one.

75
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:35,750
Cheers!

76
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,980
Old pal,

77
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,580
you aren't drunk, are you?

78
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,580
One...

79
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,810
Let's...

80
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,780
This is embarrassing.

81
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,490
But this token looks exquisite.

82
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,270
Hey, return this to him.

83
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,580
Xue Dao Yuan?

84
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,020
Hold on.

85
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,280
Xue Dao Yuan?

86
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,060
The character Xue Dao Yuan.

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,020
The legendary medical practitioner

88
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,220
with excellent medical skills.

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,050
His life passion is

90
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,660
drinking.

91
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,300
(Xue Dao Yuan.)

92
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,100
This is Xue Dao Yuan?

93
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,410
Sis, you know him?

94
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,830
You bet I do!

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,970
(This is a very important character
in my novel!)

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,600
(In the novel,
he came to the Capital on June 6,)

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,190
(and it is on the same day that)

98
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,060
(he met the poisoned male protagonist,
Qin Yu.)

99
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,400
(June 6)
In the novel, on June 6,

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,270
our male protagonist Qin Yu

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,460
encountered a life-and-death situation.

102
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,520
He was badly poisoned,

103
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,270
and was on the verge of dying.

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,260
When Qin Yu was escaping,

105
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,430
he met Xue Dao Yuan, or Dr. Xue.

106
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,040
And this doctor saved his life.

107
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,140
Qin Yu even developed a relationship
with Xue Dao Yuan's female disciple.

108
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,380
He eventually won her heart.

109
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,240
Oh, I'm so done.

110
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,730
If Qin Yu is killed by me...

111
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:25,734
What?

112
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,630
Mr. Xue,

113
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:27,990
Mr. Xue.

114
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,450
You can't be this drunk.

115
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,910
You have an important mission.

116
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,560
Mr. Xue. Mr. Xue.

117
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,150
What about this?

118
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,640
Bring him to a cabin in the mountainside
of the west of city.

119
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,570
This is where he resides.

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,900
Sis, how do you know where he lives?

121
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,240
Don't ask so many questions.

122
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,440
I wrote the whole thing.
Of course I know!

123
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,180
Your responsibility is to wake him up.

124
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,170
I'll come look for you in an hour.

125
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,480
Sis, where are you going?

126
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,140
Saving people!

127
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,100
Your Majesty.

128
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,350
This is the military deployment map
for Xirong's front line

129
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,880
that I drew in secret.

130
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,740
The military situation
of the main force of the Xirong Army,

131
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,940
locations of the stations,
and where they store foods,

132
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,730
are all in this map.

133
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,420
Let's go!

134
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,320
Old pal,

135
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,200
wake up!

136
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,450
Old pal!

137
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,890
♪Listen to the sound of tides♪

138
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,080
