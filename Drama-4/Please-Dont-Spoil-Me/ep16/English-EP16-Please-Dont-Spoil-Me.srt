=Episode 16=

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,680
You'll be punished with 30 hits,
and then banished to the Cold Palace.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,880
Empress Dowager, please don't!

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm giving you one last chance.

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,620
You can still change your mind.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,900
I've already made up my mind.

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,460
Empress Dowager, just do it!

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,400
Alright.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,820
Do it.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,930
It hurts!

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,280
Stop!

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,650
(Qin Yu?)

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,500
(Why is he here?)

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,930
Your Majesty.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,140
Your Majesty, why are you here?

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,080
Concubine Rong, sorry I'm late.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,470
What are you doing here?

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,940
Don't meddle in this!

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,030
Don't worry, I'm here.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,830
It'll be fine.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,550
(It's not fine.)

22
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,240
(You're ruining things by being here.)

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,100
Mother, may I ask,

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,670
what mistake Concubine Rong has made

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,060
that you had to punish her so harshly?

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,330
Concubine Rong of the Yan family

27
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,620
has no respect for her elders,
and poor etiquette as well.

28
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,900
I want to teach her a lesson.

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,860
Why?

30
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,990
Are you going to stop me?

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,820
She is my concubine.

32
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,010
If she made a mistake,

33
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,220
I should be the one to punish her.

34
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,740
Mother, you're sticking your nose

35
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,440
where it doesn't belong.

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,170
Your Majesty!

37
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,860
Your Majesty will defy me

38
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,220
for a mere concubine?

39
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,480
I've always respected you.

40
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,960
If it was anything else,

41
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,800
I wouldn't mind letting you
have your way.

42
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,860
But today,

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,980
I'm definitely protecting
Concubine Rong.

♪If you catch a glimpse of the breeze
and the bright moon♪

45

we've made and the things we've done♪

47
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,080
Are you okay?

48
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,460
Why don't you try getting hit

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,410
to see if you're okay?

50
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,100
It's my fault.

51
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,410
I was too late.

52
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,160
Why did you come?
You shouldn't have come at all.

53
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,220
I know

54
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,470
that you're still angry with me.

55
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,370
What do you know?

56
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,390
You know nothing!

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
(I was already hit more than ten times.)

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,780
(Now it was all for nothing.)

59
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,510
That time outside the Palace,

60
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,820
you saved me once.

61
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,650
You scared away the thief,

62
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,940
preventing the deployment map
from being leaked.

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,410
You saved me again.

64
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,510
Today, you fought with

65
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,960
the Empress Dowager over me,

66
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,230
and received a beating.

67
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,120
It seems

68
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,910
I truly owe you a great deal.

69
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,040
To make up for it,

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,920
you can request for anything you want.

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,260
I'll make it happen.

72
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,350
Anything at all?

73
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,050
Of course.

74
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,040
No take-backs?

75
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,060
You have my word.

76
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:51,970
Alright.

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,310
Then, help me with one thing.

78
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,370
Tell me.

79
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,430
I want to go back to the Cold Palace.

80
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,490
Your Majesty, it's time to eat.

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,380
Tell me,

82
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,560
am I a fool?

83
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,250
You're diligent in state affairs, and
you care for the country and the people.

84
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,850
You're one of the rarer
wise Emperors throughout history.

85
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,820
How could you be a fool?

86
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,860
But Concubine Rong is willing
to live in the Cold Palace

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,160
just to stay away from me.

88
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,980
Does she hate me that much?

89
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,530
(Liu Ying Water Pavilion)
It's impossible for her to hate you.

90
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,120
She desperately tried to save your life.

91
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,140
When you were poisoned,

92
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,350
she personally boiled the medicine
and sent it to you.

93
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,210
This time, she was punished

94
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,440
because she tried to
persuade Empress Dowager

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,270
not to be against you anymore.

96
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,180
The way I see it,

97
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,180
Her Highness really

98
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,480
loves you.

99
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,500
How touching.

100
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,580
But why does she insist

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,350
on entering the Cold Palace?

102
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,030
Maybe

103
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,330
she has other intentions,

104
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,280
making concessions to gain advantage.

105
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,070
Playing hard to get?

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,750
Li Zhi Duo,

107
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,740
I didn't know that
even though you're a eunuch,

108
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,050
you know a lot about women.

109
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,780
Now that I can see clearly,

110
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,350
I feel much better.

111
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,520
Let's eat.

112
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,420
Your Highness, you seem so happy

114
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,660
to return to the Cold Palace.

115
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,740
Of course!

116
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,340
I feel like the Cold Palace

117
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,580
is the warmest place in the world.

118
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,900
(Lan Xin Palace)

119
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm back!

120
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,100
Let's go!
