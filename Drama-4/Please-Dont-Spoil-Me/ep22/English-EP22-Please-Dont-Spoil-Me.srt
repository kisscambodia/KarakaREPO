=Episode 22=

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,300
I've really fallen for Your Majesty.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,890
Your Majesty is akin to a...

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,390
A green lotus,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,200
that can only be viewed from afar
and cannot be played with.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,800
Every time I see you,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,140
I feel ashamed

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,700
and sad.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,150
That's why I want to be
banished to the Cold Palace

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,550
so that I am relieved
of my emotional pain.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,380
Ah, I see.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,650
You saved my life.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,590
I still owe you one.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,050
All right, it's late.

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,230
You should rest early.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,330
You can leave

17
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,260
the Cold Palace any time.

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,500
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,060
I was scared to death!

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,460
(Lan Xin Palace)

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,150
Zhao Xiao Wu.

22
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:04,930
Go back and check on them.

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,080
Green lotus?

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,330
What kind of nonsense was that?

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,320
Do you want to die?

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,020
Your Highness,

29
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,290
I didn't want to utter nonsense either.

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,220
His Majesty was asking me questions,

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,930
and I was very nervous.

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,340
I couldn't think straight.

33
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,780
I didn't even know
what I was supposed to say.

34
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,230
If you don't know what to say,
then stay silent!

35
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,530
You've embarrassed me to death!

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,220
You were right.

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,450
Concubine Rong was the one
wearing the eunuch uniform.

38
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,280
The one on the bed

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,690
is a eunuch.

40
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,050
What is Concubine Rong

41
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,510
up to all the time?

42
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,710
Continue observing them.

43
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,810
If there's anything,

44
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,570
report to me immediately.

45
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,480
Brother.

47
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,520
Brother, we haven't
seen each other in a while.

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,630
Do you miss me?

49
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,850
What brought you here,

50
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,550
the Princess of Yin Empire?

51
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,370
Brother.

52
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,370
It's been a while since you
took me out of the Palace and had fun.

53
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,420
I'm bored to death.

54
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,960
Let's play outside the Palace, shall we?

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,730
Too bad.

56
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,060
I still have some documents to review.

57
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,000
I have no time to play with you.

58
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,990
You should go and play by yourself.

59
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,660
You're boring.

60
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,830
Don't go too far.

61
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,540
Your Majesty,

62
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,040
Concubine Rong

63
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,550
wore the eunuch uniform,

64
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,790
and snuck out

65
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,450
of the Palace alone again.

66
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,000
Snuck out of the Palace?

67
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,260
Brother Wen Chang,

68
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,050
it's boring to stay in the house.

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,750
Let's go out together

70
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,510
and have some fun!

71
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,120
Go.

72
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,660
Go.

73
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,240
Go.

74
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,790
Go!

75
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,120
What's the point?

76
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,460
Compared to the great writers,

77
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,030
my writing skills

78
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,360
are akin to this candle.

79
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,370
How can the light of a candle

80
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,240
compare to the glory
of the bright moon?

81
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,790
You're a grown man,

82
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,170
but you're defeated
by some stupid poems.

83
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,410
This is ridiculous.

84
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,660
Um, there's a poetry party
in the city today.

85
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,540
Let's bring Brother Wen Chang out
to attend the party.

86
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,860
Great idea!

87
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,640
Let's go.

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,530
- Go. Go. Go!
- Let's go!

89
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,250
She's here!

90
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:09,940
Follow her.

92
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,910
Here!

93
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,570
Here?

94
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,200
It's here!

95
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,540
Brother Yue,

96
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,890
forget it. We should go.

97
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,050
No way!

98
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,140
We've already been here.

99
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,020
Let's go in and check things out.

100
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,430
Let's go!

(The House of Romance)
(Where Beauties Reside)

104
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,460
Concubine Rong snuck out of the Palace

105
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,260
to visit this place?

106
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,510
What's going on in her mind?

107
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,090
Sir,

108
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,900
let me investigate the place for you.

109
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,280
Sir,

110
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,570
to my knowledge,
the people who walk in this place

111
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,870
are scholars who came to the Capital
to take the Imperial Examination.

112
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,570
Brother!

113
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,480
Ping Le!

114
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,980
What are you doing here?

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,280
Brother,

116
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,640
I thought you said
you're busy with work.

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,660
Yet, you came here to have some fun.

118
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,050
You've misunderstood.

119
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,720
Uh...

120
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,110
Sir Huang...

121
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,630
Ah, no need to explain.

Sir,

124
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,160
I investigated the place.

125
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,100
I heard that today,

126
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,960
there will be a poetry party
here in the House of Romance.

127
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,430
She should be here for the party.

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,130
She's interested in a poetry party

129
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,660
even with her poor literary skills?

130
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,690
That's very interesting.
Let me have a look.

131

However,

132
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,760
it's the organizer of the party

133
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,560
that is the issue.
