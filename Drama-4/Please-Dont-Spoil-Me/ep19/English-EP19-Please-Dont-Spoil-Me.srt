=Episode 19=

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,420
(Yu Wen Residence)

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,640
Greetings, Uncle.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,500
The Imperial Examination
is around the corner.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,850
Scholars all over the country came to
the Capital to attend the examination.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,070
Have you been practicing
your poetry skills?

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,860
It's a good time

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,080
to establish your reputation
among the scholars.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,730
Uncle, you don't know.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,220
Several people appeared out of nowhere,

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,160
and they're very good at writing poems,

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,580
especially the two named
Li Bai and Du Fu.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,620
They've almost become
the scholars' idols in the Capital.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,720
Then, get in touch
with them immediately.

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,980
I've searched all over the city,

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,460
but it's strange that

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,170
nobody knows the whereabouts
of these two.

18
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,900
Useless!

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,470
You can't even find a person.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,980
You, go and find

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,110
the other scholars and leaders.

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,950
I'll take care of

23
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,550
these new poets.

24
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:53,920
Understood.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,600
This smells nice!

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,360
Useless people!

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,040
Your Highness!

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,750
These ingredients stink!

29
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,820
Why do you like them?

30
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,930
You're so weird!

31
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,180
But, I like that even more!

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,270
You have good taste!

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
For river snail noodles,

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,830
the smellier, the better!

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,620
Since you have such good taste,

36
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,100
I'll let you have a bowl of it.

37
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,720
Your Highness, Your Highness,

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,220
this...

39
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,130
Come on! Don't be shy!

40
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,340
No.

41
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,280
The issue is not that I'm shy.

42
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,430
Hurry up.

43
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,980
This is very delicious!

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,860
Come on!

45
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,600
All right. I'll try it now.

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,040
What's going on with
Concubine Rong today?

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,650
Nothing much.

49
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,580
Just as usual.

50
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,890
Your Majesty,

51
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,650
she's been making
some very smelly dishes.

52
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,500
I don't believe it.

53
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,830
You must have made a mistake.

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,200
Your Majesty, I'm surely not mistaken.

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,720
Stop right there.

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,660
Tonight,

57
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,850
I'll check on her myself.

58
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,600
Cover it! Cover it!

59
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,850
What's that? This smells really bad!

60
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,810
Your Majesty,

61
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,090
Her Highness cooked this the whole day.

62
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,180
She calls it snail noodle or something.

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,980
Snail noodle?

64
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,930
Can something this smelly be eaten?

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,020
You're right, Your Majesty.

66
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,700
But Her Highness said this is food.

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,610
What if one turns sick
after eating this?

68
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,380
Let me try this for you, Your Majesty.

69
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,030
Go on.

70
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,900
Your Majesty, this tastes nice!

71
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,960
No abnormal taste?

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,310
No.

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,980
This snail noodle smells bad,

74
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,340
but tastes nice.

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,410
I agree, Your Majesty.

76
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,580
I'm surprised to find that

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,990
Her Highness knows how to cook.

78
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,960
Fu Ling, I'm hungry.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,580
Get me some river snail noodles.

80
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,800
It's time to leave, Your Majesty.

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,300
Okay.

82
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,860
Let's go.

83
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,420
Your Highness!

84
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,710
Oh no, Your Highness!

85
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,870
Our noodles have been stolen!

86
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,510
Our noodles?

87
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,380
Who ate my river snail noodles?

88
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,410
Who? Who?

89
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,400
Not me!

90
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,570
Who would even steal
from the Cold Palace?

91
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,710
So cruel!

92
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,940
Let's go.

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,900
Oh no, my noodles are gone!

94
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,250
(Since I'm already in the Cold Palace,)

95
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,010
(it's only a matter of time
before I complete the mission.)

96
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,190
(I've been bored for so many days.)

97
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,090
(I should sneak out and have some fun.)

98
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,000
(This is a world
I created, after all.)

99
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,470
(I should walk around
and explore it myself.)

100
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,580
(This is not something
unreasonable to do.)

101
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,700
Little Six,

102
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,600
you're the one who purchases
things outside the Palace, right?

103
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,800
Correct, Your Highness.

104
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,670
Undress.

105
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,250
I want to wear your uniform
and sneak out of the Palace.

106
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,600
Your Highness, we can't do this.

107
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,810
If we get caught,
we'll be beheaded.

108
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,750
We can't do this?

109
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,670
No. We absolutely can't.

110
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,620
No room for negotiation?

111
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
Absolutely no room for negotiation!

112
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,340
Then, someone's jewelry
will have to...

113
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,040
Okay, fine!

114
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,810
Stop right there!

115
