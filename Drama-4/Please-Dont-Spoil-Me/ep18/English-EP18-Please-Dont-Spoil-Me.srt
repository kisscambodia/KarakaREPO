=Episode 18=

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,400
Her Highness has given me so many poems,

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,940
how should I repay her?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,180
(Four Seas Bookstore)

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,850
Hello.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,930
Let me show you something nice.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,510
This is for me?

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,330
They're all yours.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,020
How much?

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,290
I don't want a single penny.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,560
I have a matter to discuss today.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,200
There have been frequent droughts
in many places,

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,120
and the people are suffering.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,780
We should have allocated food
for disaster relief,

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,640
and built water conservancy projects.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,930
But the national treasury is empty.

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,920
Therefore,

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,560
I want to implement a new policy.

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,140
Scholar gentries shall be made
officials, and pay tax in kind.

20
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,680
What do my deputies think about this?

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,280
Your Majesty is wise and insightful.
We shall receive your grace,

22
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,510
set an example,

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,540
and follow the new policy.

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
We second the motion.

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,340
Your Majesty, have a bowl of pear soup.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,870
It relieves heat and tiredness.

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,420
I remember back then,

28
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,860
Concubine Rong put an aphrodisiac
in a bowl of pear soup,

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,340
because she wanted to
stay the night with me.

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,160
Although she's playing hard to get,

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,160
she's still a woman after all.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,030
I can understand.

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,230
I'll wait until she starts
to miss me a lot,

34
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,270
then I'll take the initiative
to give her an out,

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,380
and bring her out of the Cold Palace.

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

37
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,960
You're right on time.

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,740
How's Concubine Rong doing
in the Cold Palace?

39
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,040
Has she lost her desire for meals,

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,030
sitting around restlessly,

41
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,590
like she's missing someone?

42
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,340
No.

43
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,750
Concubine Rong

44
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,680
is having good meals and
great rest in the Cold Palace.

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,690
How is this possible?

46
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,300
It's true, Your Majesty.

47
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,780
Zhao, did you see it clearly?

48
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,530
Did you miss the moments when

49
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,480
Concubine Rong was unhappy
and missing His Majesty?

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,470
I...

51
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,280
I was only observing
from outside the courtyard,

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,980
but...

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,740
But Concubine Rong

54
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,580
didn't look like she's unhappy.

55
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,420
According to the books,

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,650
being apart for just a day

57
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,140
feels like an eternity
to a couple in love.

58
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,030
Just like me,

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,890
although I'm always busy
with state affairs,

60
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,160
I still think about...

61
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,350
Li Zhi Duo, tell me,

62
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,340
what is going on?

63
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,470
Your Majesty,

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,110
perhaps Concubine Rong
is making concessions,

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,290
and is putting on a show
these days,

66
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,760
to stop herself from missing you?

67
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,900
What you're saying makes sense.

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
I think that's what it is.

69
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,170
That's not right, Your Majesty.

70
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,480
I don't think

71
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,680
Concubine Rong looks like she's acting.

72
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,060
Zhao, you're a roughneck.

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,710
What do you know about love?

74
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,520
Your Majesty, don't listen
to his nonsense.

75
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,250
I'm a roughneck?

76
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,070
Enough, both of you may leave.

77
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,480
I want to be alone.

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,050
Now,

79
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,240
the new policy will be implemented soon.

80
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,500
In order to prevent their property
from being liquidated,

81
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,900
many officials will turn
to Qin Yu's side.

82
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,360
Empress Dowager, don't get angry.

83
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,440
Those clear-headed leaders
still value false titles.

84
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,110
But it won't be that easy
for His Majesty

85
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,030
to implement the new policy.

86
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,820
The new policy not only harms
the interest of the court officials,

87
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,780
but also the benefits of scholars
all over the country.

88
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,330
The Imperial Examination is coming soon,

89
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,330
and the Capital is full of scholars.

90
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,040
All we need to do is to spread
a little rumor among the scholars that

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,260
even if they pass the examination,

92
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,270
they still have to be an official
and pay tax in kind.

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
They'll stand up against it.

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
This way,

95
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,240
not only will it be difficult
to implement the new policy,

96
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,880
His Majesty will also lose face
in front of all people.

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,690
That's a pretty good plan.

98
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,200
If all the scholars in the country

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,310
speak out against the new policy,

100
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,450
it cannot be implemented.
