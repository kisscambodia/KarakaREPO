=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 7=

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,880
Dad, mom, don't worry.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,030
I've prepared 80 elite soldiers.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,500
I can invade the Cold Palace
and save my sis anytime.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,010
Good plan.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,060
You guys should leave.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,170
Shut the door.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,180
Yes, Master!

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,710
Son,

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,170
come here.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,740
Disobedient son!

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,780
You disobedient son!

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,170
Dad!

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,650
Dad!

15
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,180
Disobedient son!

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,120
You're not saving your sister.

17
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,760
You're putting our whole family

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,750
in great danger!

19
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,310
Never mind.

20
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,510
Let me plead with Her Grace.

21
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,760
She should forgive her

22
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,550
for we are relatives.

23
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,690
Master!

24
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,450
Come in.

25
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,900
Master!

26
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,100
The eunuch in the Palace
has sent us a letter.

27
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,810
He said the letter is from our miss.

28
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,080
Get away!

29
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,330
Dear dad and mom,

30
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,660
let me emphasize,

31
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,010
the important thing is

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,760
don't plead with Her Grace.

33
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,320
In the following 100 days,

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,450
don't get near

35
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,840
Her Grace.

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,490
Your Majesty, this is
all about the letter.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,880
I knew it.

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,090
It's not as simple as it seems.

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,630
It looks like the empress dowager
is plotting something behind the scene.

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,800
Yan Da Hai is famous
for loving his daughter.

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,260
He knows what happened to his daughter,

42
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,600
and will do whatever he can
to save her.

43
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,840
But he knows he can't plead with me.

44
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,330
So the empress dowager

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,820
has become his only hope.

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,550
Yan Da Hai

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,150
is the Deputy Vanguard Grain Officer,

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,310
and is responsible for delivering
grain for the Northwest Front.

49
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,180
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,680
does Her Grace want to

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,460
do something to the delivery
of grain for the Northwest Front?

52
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,050
When Concubine Rong

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,860
voluntarily went into the Cold Palace,

54
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,850
she's clearly playing
the empress dowager's script.

55
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,980
But, why did she send a letter

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,460
telling her father not to save her?

57
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,640
And, she emphasized on 100 days.

58
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,010
What does this mean?

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,610
I can't figure out

60
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,280
this woman's intention.

61
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,880
Pay close attention to the empress
dowager, prime minister, and Yan Da Hai.

62
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,710
Qin Yu

63
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,020
is just an illegitimate child.

64
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,330
You are the son of the late emperor.

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,860
This throne

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,420
belongs to you anyway.

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,290
I'm fighting the throne for you.

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,130
But you have to put in
some effort as well.

69
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,850
Mother,

70
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm only interested in poems and music.

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,530
I'm really not interested

72
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,770
in politics.

73
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,310
Since my father has passed the throne
to my brother,

74
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,990
I should just be a happy prince,

75
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,060
and abide by my role.

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,140
That way, I'll live a carefree life.

77
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,030
Are you saying

78
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,790
I'm not abiding by my role?

79
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,310
Mother, you've misunderstood me.

80
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,170
That's not what I meant.

81
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,770
So many years have transpired,

82
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,970
and you're still defending Qin Yu.

83
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,210
You should know that

84
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,880
he's been talking behind our back.

85
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,980
That's why your father

86
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,310
deserted us.

87
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,310
Maybe my father had
his reasons for doing so.

88
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,600
You!

89
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,070
Sorry, mother,

90
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,880
for making you angry again.

91
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,450
It's late now.

92
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,850
I should go.

93
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,000
You!

94
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,800
You!

95
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,400
Your Highness.

96
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,650
Where are we going?

97
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,650
I just want to wander around the place.

98
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,000
(Beautiful mountain view)
Hurry up!

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,910
I'm coming!

100
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,650
Come on!

101
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,080
Coming!

102
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,090
Hurry up! Come here!

103
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,890
It's hot!

104
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,750
Careful. Careful. Careful.

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,420
Careful. Careful.

106
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,430
In all of history,

107
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,630
the Cold Palace has been
a sad and lonely place.

108
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,960
And it's common
to hear the sounds of crying here.

109
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,530
It's my first time hearing

110
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,470
such cheerful and lively sound here.

111
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,770
Come. Come here and eat.

112
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,220
Let's eat!

113
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Wait!

114
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,800
For what?

115
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,090
Before we eat,

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,430
we want to listen to
Your Highness.

117
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,950
Yeah!

118
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,480
I see. Then,

119
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,450
let me say a few words.

120
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,270
You guys should know that

121
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,780
outside the Cold Palace,

122
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,880
I've angered His Majesty.

123
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,880
That's why

124
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,890
I'm here.

125
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,920
But this is no big issue.

126
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,240
Both the Cold Palace
and the harem are palaces.

127
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,590
We can continue living
our happy lives here.

128
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,690
We can even try to
live a better life here!

129
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,130
Let's eat!

130
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,560
Your Highness,

131
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,980
what improper it is

132
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,570
for people to play around like this
in the Cold Palace!

133
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,970
This is more like a restaurant.

134
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,280
There's no order left
for the Cold Palace!

135
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,270
Why isn't anybody correcting
this misbehavior?

136
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,400
Its torrent dashes down
three thousand feet from high,

137
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,160
as if the Silver River
fell from azure sky.

138
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,110
What a great poem!

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,610
Eunuch,

140
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,960
for these poems,

141
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,330
we've let Concubine Rong off the hook.

142
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,150
Are we making a mistake for doing this?

143
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,970
You don't understand.

144
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,290
These poems

145
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,560
are worth a thousand pieces
of gold out there.

146
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,810
Why is Concubine Rong
sharing them with me

147
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,440
without hesitation?

148
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,510
It's because she feels

149
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,810
close to me.

150
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,290
A few good meals can't be compared to
this kind of relationship.

151
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,960
Cheers!

152
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,780
Let's eat!

153
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,110
- Let's play some games!
- Sure! Let's play!

154
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,190
Stick, stick, tiger!

155
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,370
Stick, stick, pig!

156
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,770
Concubine Rong
is really impressive.

157
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,760
However,

158
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,270
she doesn't look

159
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,400
as spoiled as the rumor has it.

160
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,730
Badum, tish! Badum, tish!

161
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,740
Yan Yi Yi!

162
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,480
Yan Yi Yi, come out!
