=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 8=

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,970
Ignore her. Get up!

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,670
Why are you kneeling?

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,620
Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,730
Yan Yi Yi,

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,200
how dare you not kneel
when you see me?

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,620
You're being disrespectful!

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,430
What will you do then?

9
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,740
Cast me to the Cold Palace?

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,520
I'm already in the Cold Palace!

11
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,780
You're just a nobody.

12
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,560
Why are you as pretentious as a pig?

13
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,770
You!

14
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,580
How dare you call me pig?

15
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:25,970
You!

16
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,800
Yan Yi Yi,

17
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,160
how dare you feast
in the Cold Palace?

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,230
What a scandal!

19
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:33,790
What now?

20
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,330
Did you set the rule that nobody
can feast in the Cold Palace?

21
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,680
You!

22
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,450
You're arguing irrationally!

23
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,300
Come.

24
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,130
Ask the eunuch in charge
of the Cold Palace to come here.

25
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,040
I want to see

26
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,300
how he will handle you.

27
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,140
Your Highness,

28
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,340
these ingredients have been
sent by Eunuch Niu,

29
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,340
the eunuch in charge of the Cold Palace.

30
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,240
What?

31
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,780
Niu and I feel like old friends,

32
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,080
and he's afraid that I get hungry.

33
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,780
That's why he sent me some ingredients.
What's wrong?

34
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,720
Why are you such a busybody?

35
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,840
Mind your own business!

36
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,010
You! You!

37
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,060
You!

38
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,940
Busybody?

39
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,890
Mind your business?

40
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,040
This girl is interesting.

41
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,830
She's funny.

42
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,610
You can't fight me.

43
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,800
You can't quarrel with me.

44
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,370
Just go back to where you belong.

45
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,170
In the future,

46
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,690
you live in your palace

47
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,600
and I live in my Cold Palace.

48
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,050
And, we leave each other alone.

49
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,210
What a joke!

50
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,160
You're already in the Cold Palace!

51
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,090
And you think
I can't do anything to you?

52
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,210
Come!

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,330
Don't bully Concubine Rong!

54
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,840
It's fine.

55
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,930
I know how to fight,

56
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,100
and I've done some free combat before.

57
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,690
I'm not afraid of her.

58
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,430
Hah, you have a stubborn mind,

59
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,380
even when you're about to get hit.

60
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,490
Beat her!

61
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah, Concubine Rong is the best!

62
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,850
Beat her to death!

63
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,350
Stop!

64
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,330
(Who is it?)

65
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

66
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,880
Rise.

67
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,080
(Prince Ying,)

68
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,860
(the son of the empress dowager,)

69
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,790
Qin Yu's half-brother.

70
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,860
He's handsome
and good at writing poems.

71
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,300
(His look sticks to the script.)

72
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,730
(He's quite handsome.)

73
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,930
Your Highness, why are you here?

74
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,300
I came across this place,

75
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,150
and heard some noises.

76
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,600
That's why I came here.

77
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,770
Consort Li,

78
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,580
what are you...

79
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,630
Your Highness,
please allow me to explain.

80
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,340
Concubine Rong has offended me.

81
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,660
She shows no remorse,

82
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,690
and is very arrogant.

83
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,000
That's why

84
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,710
I tried to teach her a lesson.

85
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,390
♪I don't know how to
hide from your sight♪

86
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,460
I see.

87
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,190
However,

88
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,340
Concubine Rong has already been punished

89
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,780
for her wrongdoings

90
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,940
by being sent to the Cold Palace.

91
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,510
And now, you're
using illegal punishments,

92
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,060
which is also
a violation of the palace rules.

93
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,060
If His Majesty knows about this,

94
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,940
you'll be downgraded,

95
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,010
and also be sent
to the Cold Palace.

96
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,200
Consort Li,

97
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,290
you should've known about this, right?

98
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,500
Thank you for reminding me.

99
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,680
I'll do the right thing.

100
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,480
For His Highness's sake,

101
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,230
I'll let you go now.

102
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,480
A decree has arrived!

103
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,620
Wow, so many people are here!

104
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,130
His Majesty has issued a decree.

105
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,520
Concubine Rong,
please accept the decree.

106
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,280
Having received the Mandate from Heaven,
the emperor hereby announces

107
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,210
since Concubine Rong
is virtuous, diligent and thrifty,

108
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,370
she should move
out of the Cold Palace immediately.

109
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,020
What?

110
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,330
Congratulations!

111
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,730
You can finally leave this place!

112
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,470
Please.

113
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,090
- No way!
- No way!

114
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,880
Um, please. You first.

115
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,890
Eunuch Li, is this a mistake?

116
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,170
Yan Yi Yi has offended me,

117
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,530
and has broken
His Majesty's favorite vase.

118
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,040
Why was she only sent

119
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,890
to the Cold Palace for a day?

120
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,030
Yeah!

121
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,460
I've broken his stupid vase

122
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,870
to more than 1890 pieces.

123
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,010
I should stay here
for at least 100 days!

124
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,820
That's right!

125
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,000
His Majesty really favors you.

126
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,680
It's just a vase.

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,820
To him,

128
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,300
it's nothing compared to you.

129
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,120
(Wow, this is so disgusting)

130
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,890
(and pretentious!)

131
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,080
(What's Qin Yu trying to do?)

132
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,940
(No. I need to come up with
a counter-plan.)

133
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,160
But, Yan Yi Yi has shown no remorse.

134
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,380
She's even feasting, singing and dancing

135
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,230
in the Cold Palace.

136
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,530
She clearly

137
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,060
does not think His Majesty's
punishment is important.

138
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,640
Yeah!

139
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,500
I don't care about
the punishment at all!

140
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,620
I'm disobedient.

141
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,350
You can't let me out like this.

142
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,740
Hey,

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,260
what other reasons do you have in mind?

144
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,400
I want to refer to them.

145
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,360
What do you mean?

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Hey, don't get me wrong.

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,290
We're on the same boat here.

148
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,050
Who's on the same boat with you?

149
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,000
What about

150
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,530
me beating you up again?

151
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,070
Are you insane?

152
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,650
Go away!

153
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,480
Stop fighting, you two.

154
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,910
His Majesty has issued the decree.
We can't make a change now.

155
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,720
Otherwise, it's resisting the decree.

156
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,130
Concubine Rong,

157
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,190
please follow me.

158
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,950
Let me resist the decree then.
I won't leave.

159
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,330
If that's the way,

160
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,060
sorry, Concubine Rong.

161
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,770
What are you trying to do?

162
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,010
Let me go! I'm not leaving!

163
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,090
Concubine Rong, why are you doing this?

164
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,240
Your own palace

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,790
is way more comfortable than this place!

166
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,930
You don't understand.

167
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,550
Yeah, I don't.

168
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,370
Come on. One, two.

169
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,900
One, two, three!

170
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,720
(Hua Qing Palace)

171
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,970
Your Majesty, please revoke the decree.

172
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,450
If others get to leave the Cold Palace,

173
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,510
they would be thanking me instead.

174
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,200
Why are you

175
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,330
not accepting this decree of mine?

176
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,830
In my heart, I do.

177
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,670
But, I think I deserve more punishments.

178
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,330
I still need to learn my lessons
in the Cold Palace.

179
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,540
If you let me out this early,

180
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,900
I'll be a danger to society.

181
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,530
I'm the Son of Heaven.

182
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,700
My words

183
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,700
cannot be simply reversed.

184
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,030
You banished me to the
Cold Palace yesterday,

185
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,760
and let me out today.

186
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,830
Isn't that reversing your words as well?

187
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,610
I mean,

188
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,710
maybe you should further
consider this option?

189
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,100
I've made up my mind.

190
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,590
If you have nothing else to tell me,

191
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,430
then you should leave.

192
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,560
No.

193
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,960
If you don't agree,

194
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,180
then I'll...

195
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,620
I...

196
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,450
What will you do?

197
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:56,920
I...

198
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,780
I'll destroy this!

199
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,410
A box of vases like this is worth
ten taels of silver.

200
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,540
And there are six of these in a box.

201
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,690
If you will,

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,530
you may destroy them.

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,440
Do you have anything else to say?

204
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,480
Fine.

205
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,360
Just don't agree.

206
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,800
I've wanted your body
for a long time anyway.

207
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,110
If you don't send me to the Cold Palace,

208
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,580
I'll drug you with aphrodisiac
every day.

209
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,420
What... What are you doing?

210
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,070
♪Listen to the sound of tides♪

211
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,260
♪They are saying I do♪

212
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,840
♪The setting sun is listening
to your whispers♪

213
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,000
♪I have told you too many of my secrets♪

214
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,980
♪I am being too sweet♪

215
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,230
♪The whole galaxy is shining for you♪
