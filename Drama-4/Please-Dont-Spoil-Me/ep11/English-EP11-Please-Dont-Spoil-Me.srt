Sis!

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,180
Why is he here?

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,390
What's going on?

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,610
Don't ask so many questions.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,370
Just help me move him into the house.

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:17,860
Hurry up!

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,000
Sis, what do I do now?

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,100
What do you do?

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,840
Undress!

13
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:28,725
What?

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,290
Yeah! Undress him now!

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,100
Like I owed you.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,550
Sis!

17
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,070
Sis!

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:14,860
Sis!

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,460
Sis!

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,260
Stop!

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,770
What are you doing?

22
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,930
I'm saving his life.

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,520
You won't get it.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,470
Get out.

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,160
Even for saving his life,

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,880
you shouldn't do this!

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,750
As I said, get out!

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,340

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,960
Get out and guard the door!

31
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,200

Your Majesty,

according to the statement
of the assassins we caught,

64
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,260
they're all from Xirong.

65
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,850
They found our spy
and started tracking him.

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,240
