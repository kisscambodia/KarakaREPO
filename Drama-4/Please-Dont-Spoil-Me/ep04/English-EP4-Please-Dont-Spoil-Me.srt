=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 4=

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,320
You... You...

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,750
What are you?

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,220
I'm the officer in charge of
managing the plot of a book.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,020
You can call me Book Officer.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,770
I'm in charge of

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,830
everything in the world of this book.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,220
Book Officer?

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm the author of this novel.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,060
Are you also in charge of me?

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,910
Of course.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,530
As long as you're in this world,

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm in charge.

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,130
Then...

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,170
Then what is happening to me?

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,660
I told you just now.

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,440
You

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,470
have seriously changed
the original fate of the character.

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,030
I have to eliminate you

20
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,930
to maintain the stability of this world.

21
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,460
Then,

22
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,200
after I'm eliminated,

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,380
do I return to my original world?

24
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,260
You wish!

25
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,610
After you're eliminated,

26
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,860
you will cease to exist

27
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,490
in both the book world
and the real world.

28
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,840
Death is your only end.

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,930
Please don't, I want to live.

30
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,550
You...

31
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,930
Give me another chance.

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,250
I suppose

33
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,040
I could give you another chance.

34
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,570
You'll have to follow the original plot,

35
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,960
and enter the Cold Palace,

36
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,660
restoring the original fate
of the character.

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,840
Then you can escape
from being eliminated.

38
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,170
By the way,

39
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,930
if you stay in the Cold Palace
for a hundred days,

40
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,140
you can leave this world,

41
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,840
and return to the real world.

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,230
Finally, some good news.

43
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,730
I'm the author of this novel,

44
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,690
how hard could it be for me

45
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,920
to enter the Cold Palace?

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,390
The clock is ticking.
There's no time to waste.

47
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,200
Your Majesty.

48
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,330
Last night,

49
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,200
after Concubine Rong left Hua Qing Pool,

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,450
the Empress Dowager
sent someone to summon her.

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,650
However,

52
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm not sure

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,040
what they were talking about.

54
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,470
Even if she has
the Empress Dowager behind her,

55
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,680
I will not indulge her.

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,210
Once I obtain solid evidence,

57
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,220
I will definitely banish her
to the Cold Palace.

58
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,780
Your Majesty!

60
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,890
Your Majesty,

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
Concubine Rong wants to see you.

62
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,680
She has a confession to make.

63
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,410
(Confession)
I, Yan Yi Yi,

64
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,160
(Confession)
coveted Your Majesty's beauty,

65
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,280
hence was possessed

66
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,420
to put aphrodisiacs
in the pear soup,

67
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,930
in an attempt to spend
the night with you.

68
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,540
This action was shameless

69
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,750
and sinful.

70
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,890
I wrote a letter

71
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,060
pleading guilty to Your Majesty.

72
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,080
Please punish me severely.

73
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,570
Your Majesty.

74
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,280
What game are you playing with me?

75
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,280
Your Majesty,

76
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,700
I...

77
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,790
I'm here to plead guilty sincerely.

78
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,910
Do you think that
if you willingly confess,

79
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,360
making concessions in order
to gain advantages,

80
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,740
I would spare you?

81
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,630
Do not spare me.

82
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,940
Do not spare me at all.

83
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,400
The nature of the crime I committed

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,820
is extremely serious,

85
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,910
and has an extremely negative impact.
It is unforgivable.

86
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,520
Please follow the palace rules
and banish me to the Cold Palace.

87
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,520
You want me to banish you
to the Cold Palace?

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
Your Majesty, it is only right
that I'm punished for my mistake.

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,800
Your Majesty, please banish me
to the Cold Palace.

90
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,480
Seeing as you're confessing
so sincerely,

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,730
I would have been too mean

92
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,420
if I didn't give you a chance.

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,980
Li Zhi Duo.

94
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,360
I decree,

96
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,540
send Concubine Rong
back to her palace.

97
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:51,890
Your Majesty,

98
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,240
since Concubine Rong
admitted it herself,

99
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,980
why don't you just banish her
to the Cold Palace?

100
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,470
Yesterday, she tried her best
to destroy the evidence,

101
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,930
yet today, she willingly
came to confess.

102
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,810
The change in her attitude
is too drastic.

103
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,080
Don't you think it's weird?

104
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,850
I do feel like something is off.

105
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,450
Although I don't know what
she's trying to achieve,

106
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,180
what I do know is that

107
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,620
she wants to
enter the Cold Palace so badly.

108
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,050
I will not allow that to happen.

109
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,810
Your Majesty is so wise!

110
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,180
(Ci An Palace)

111
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,140
Your Highness, look.

112
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,690
Wow, Concubine Rong's status isn't high,

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,520
yet she's quite haughty.

114
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,890
She's even later than I am

115
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,020
to greet Her Grace.

116
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,060
(Consort Li, niece of Empress Dowager,
low IQ, bossy and jealous)

117
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,900
(Internal hemorrhoids)

118
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,720
Hey, it must be difficult for you.

119
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,060
Cut down on the spicy food.

120
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,640
How do you know?

121
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,120
What are you talking about?
You're not making any sense.

122
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,740
Your Highness, let's go.

123
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,570
What's the hurry?
I'm waiting for someone.

124
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,570
Waiting for someone?

125
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,700
Once Consort Li comes over,

126
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,720
she'll give us trouble.

127
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,200
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

128
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,890
Greetings, Your Highness.

129
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,860
You

130
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,490
are Fu Ling, right?

131
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,160
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,660
I'm a little tired.

133
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,400
Come here.

134
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,140
Massage my legs.

135
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,500
Don't you have your own maids?

136
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,860
Did I hear that right?

137
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,600
Concubine Rong, who has
never treated maids as humans,

138
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,430
actually cares about a little maid.

139
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,030
Alright, then.

140
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,820
I won't ask her to do it.

141
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,340
You do it.

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,900
Your Highness, please calm down.

143
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,950
I'll massage your legs for you.

144
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,720
Get lost.

145
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,110
Hey, are you okay?

146
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,030
I was talking to your master.

147
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,450
I'm okay.

148
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,510
How dare you interrupt me?

149
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,390
I was a little hesitant at first.

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,650
But now,

151
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm more than willing to do it.

152
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,820
What are you going to do?

153
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,630
I'm warning you,

154
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,550
assaulting someone superior

155
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,560
is a serious crime.

156
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,590
If it's not serious,

157
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,690
then I wouldn't beat you up.

158
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,350
I...
