00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,970
Congratulations, Your Highness!

3
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,440
You're staying with His Majesty tonight.

♪May I know what the color
of your dream is♪

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Your Majesty, didn't you
ask me to stay the night?

6
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,710
Your Majesty, would you like Her Highness
to spend the night with you?

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,070
What do you think?

8
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,040
♪Our heartbeats are
slowly synchronizing♪

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,470
His Majesty decrees

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,170
Concubine Rong shall stay the night
at Hua Qing Palace.

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,330
His Majesty decrees that
he's not feeling well,

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,130
and Concubine Rong shall be
sent back to her palace.

13
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,620
Your Majesty,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,440
we just let Concubine Rong go?

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,380
She spilled the pear soup,

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,100
and the evidence is gone.

17
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,070
What can I do about it?

18
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,750
But... But she messed around

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,410
with your food.

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,820
We should execute
her entire family.

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,120
She's always been unruly,

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,970
relying on the Empress Dowager's favor,

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,310
but I never expected her

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,590
to give me an aphrodisiac.

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,710
And she even...

26
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,750
This woman!

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,220
When I get the chance,

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,450
I'll definitely banish her
to the Cold Palace!

29
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,180
Empress Dowager.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,770
I have news from Hua Qing Pool.

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,370
How is it?

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,450
His Majesty has banished Concubine Rong
to the Cold Palace, right?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,320
No, she wasn't banished.

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,210
She walked out from Hua Qing Pool.

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,560
All is calm with His Majesty,

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
as if nothing happened at all.

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,160
How is this possible?

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,490
Call Concubine Rong over.

39
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,090
I'll ask her myself.

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,020
Yes, Empress Dowager.

41
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,620
(Granny Wang, smiling tiger,
Empress Dowager's confidant, ruthless)

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,230
Granny Wang.

44
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,630
What brings you here so late at night?

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,850
Your Highness, you know that

46
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,280
although you are the Empress Dowager's
distant relative,

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,850
she's always had
a special affinity with you.

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,660
She misses you so much

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,550
even though you've only
been away for a while,

50
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,490
so she asked me to invite you

51
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,620
to have a chat with her.

52
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,300
(The Empress Dowager has always
used Yan Yi Yi like a fool.)

53
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,330
(I know this better than anyone else.)

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,910
(In the book, she designed the plan)

55
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,730
(to banish Yan Yi Yi
to the cold palace.)

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,090
(I must tread carefully.)

57
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,330
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

58
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,440
As you were.

59
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,040
Have a seat.

60
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,260
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

61
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,338
(Empress Dowager Yu Wen,
late Emperor's favorite,)

62
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:05,540
(scheming, attends
court from behind the veil)

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,030
(The scheming Empress Dowager Yu Wen.)

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,760
(Even that evil Qin had to)

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,110
(use all his might to beat her.)

66
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,520
(She is the second most
difficult character in the book.)

67
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,090
(I have to be careful.)

68
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,570
(I mustn't reveal my true colors.)

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,740
You sent the pear soup
to His Majesty today.

70
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,560
Didn't he ask you to stay?

71
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,350
Um,

72
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,920
it was too slippery at Hua Qing Pool.

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,690
I accidentally spilled
the whole bowl of pear soup.

74
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,120
Spilled?

75
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,600
Yes.

76
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,800
If I didn't spill the pear soup,

77
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,950
I would have been staying the night
with His Majesty,

78
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,320
instead of having a chat here with you.

79
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,680
That's fine.

80
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,730
Tomorrow,

81
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,340
send another bowl to him.

82
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,950
Empress Dowager,

83
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,620
actually, I don't have to
give His Majesty an aphrodisiac.

84
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,730
He already likes me.

85
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,340
His Majesty likes you?

86
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,570
Of course.

87
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,450
I didn't give him the aphrodisiac,

88
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,850
but he also asked me to stay the night.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
He suddenly
felt a little uncomfortable,

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,280
so it didn't happen.

91
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,410
His Majesty asked you to stay the night?

92
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,180
I swear it's true.

93
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,500
If you don't believe me,

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,660
you can ask that eunuch Li Zhi Duo.

95
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,680
He can be my witness.

96
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,300
I really don't have to drug him.

97
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,350
He already likes me.

98
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,940
That's enough.

99
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,610
You should go back to rest.

100
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,570
Aren't time travelers supposed
to be able to blend in easily

101
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,310
and live an amazing life?

102
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,940
Why am I having such a hard time

103
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,960
in my own novel?

104
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,960
After dealing with the Emperor,

105
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,230
I have to deal with the Empress Dowager.

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,980
I'm stuck between a rock
and a hard place.

107
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,240
Everyone's trying to banish me
to the Cold Palace.

108
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,450
Even so,

109
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,710
no matter how difficult
all of you are to deal with,

110
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,790
I'm the author of this book.

111
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,320
I know everything about you,

112
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,950
so I will never lose to you.

113
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,270
But they're all so cunning.

114
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,620
I shouldn't play around with them.

115
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,100
I should try to find a way to get home.

116
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,580
Oh, my.

117
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,440
What is going on?

118
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,240
(You were not banished
to the Cold Palace.)

119
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,420
(The original fate of the character
has been changed.)

120
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,440
(You caused a conflict in the plot)

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,000
(and therefore shall be eliminated.)

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,770
Who's talking?

123
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,500
Who is it?

124
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,510
Who's talking?

125
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,590
Come... Come out!

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,500
