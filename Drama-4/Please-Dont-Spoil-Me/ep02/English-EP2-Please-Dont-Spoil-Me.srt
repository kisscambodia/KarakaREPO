00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,420
=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 2=

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,520
How dare you!

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,420
Guards!

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,680
Take her away!

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,340
No, no.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,820
This dream is turning into a nightmare.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,580
Your Highness!

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,130
Goodbye!

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,300
That wasn't hard enough.

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,810
Your Highness!

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,900
(Ci An Palace)

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,250
(Empress Dowager Yu Wen)
I've heard good news from the Northwest.

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,660
(Empress Dowager Yu Wen)
I have to admit,

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,120
Qin Yu is indeed somewhat capable.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,020
(Yu Wen Xun)
Empress Dowager, as such,

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,810
it seems like His Majesty

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,070
might actually

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,900
be able to regain
the 16 Northwest states.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,720
Back then, Qin Yu wanted
a Northern expedition,

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,520
but I was strongly against it.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,610
Now he keeps regaining the old land,

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,030
and his prestige is increasing.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,610
If this goes on any longer,

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,360
I might not be able to control him.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,330
That's right.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,840
I think

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,870
we need to hurry up our plan

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,980
to banish Concubine Rong
to the Cold Palace.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,190
Don't worry, brother.

30
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,550
I've already made some arrangements.

31
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,360
Once His Majesty banishes Concubine Rong
to the Cold Palace,

32
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,080
we can immediately start
the next part of our plan.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,960
- Your Highness, please don't scare me.
- I'm late.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,860
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,060
- She's fine.
- Don't scare me.

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,880
She just fainted.

37
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,140
Wake her up.

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,930
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,000
You, come with me.

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,130
Are you sure you saw Concubine Rong

42
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,380
drugging the soup?

43
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,140
I saw it with my own eyes.

44
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,350
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,420
it's an aphrodisiac.

46
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,870
Your Highness, you're awake.

47
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,450
Your Highness.

48
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,600
Your Highness, you're awake.

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,090
Why am I still here?

50
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,720
(I've entered my own novel?)

51
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,940
Your Highness,

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,440
you scared Fu Ling to death.

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,200
Fu Ling?

54
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,520
You're Fu Ling?

55
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,770
That means I'm Concubine Rong!

56
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,820
Your Highness,

57
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,650
are you okay?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,110
(This isn't a dream.)

59
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,930
(I've entered my own novel.)

60
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,010
(Oh, no.)

61
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,900
(This is Hua Qing Pool?)

62
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,180
(I somehow crossed over
into this scene.)

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,040
Where's my pear soup?

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,660
Over there.

65
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,020
Your Highness!

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,310
Your Highness!

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,370
Your Highness,

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
aren't you going to
give His Majesty this soup?

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,990
No way!

70
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,240
If I do, I'm going to die.

71
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,730
Concubine Rong.

72
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,160
Where are you going?

73
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,280
Your Majesty,
since you're busy with state affairs,

74
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,780
I won't disturb you.

75
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,970
Didn't you send me some soup?

76
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:24,980
Where's the soup?

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,830
The soup is already cold.

78
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,000
Let me heat it up for you.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,640
There's no need.

80
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,300
The weather is hot.

81
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,050
I want to drink something cold.

82
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,480
Cold soup is bad for the stomach.

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,630
Your Majesty, you must
take care of your body.

84
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,330
There's no harm.

85
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,060
It's just a bowl of soup.

86
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,530
Serve it to me.

87
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,670
(This won't do.)

88
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,550
(He doesn't actually
want to drink the soup.)

89
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,240
(He just wants to obtain the evidence
to banish me to the Cold Palace.)

90
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,720
Concubine Rong,

91
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,650
are you resisting my order?

92
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,940
(It's my fault
for making you so nit-picky.)

93
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,130
(Such a handful.)

94
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,990
Alright.

95
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,400
If you want to drink it,
I'll serve it to you.

96
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,620
I spilled it.

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,600
I'm so clumsy,

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,350
I shouldn't stay here.

99
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,850
Stop.

100
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,340
How could anyone hate

101
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,500
such a beautiful lady?

102
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,790
Just stay here

103
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,060
and sleep with me tonight.

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,800
(He must have wanted
the medicine bottle from me.)

105
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,560
(You're really something, Qin Yu.)

106
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,790
(You're asking me to stay the night)

107
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,660
(as an excuse to catch me red-handed.)

108
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,790
My aunt is here.
[*period]

109
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,420
Aunt?

110
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, period. I mean my period.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,980
Your Highness,

112
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,900
I remember the menstrual cycles

113
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,090
of all the concubines in the harem.

114
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,890
Yours isn't here yet.

115
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,390
Concubine Rong,
you acted frivolously today,

116
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,440
and now you're making excuses.

117
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,220
Is there some secret you're hiding?

118
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,730
(You're so pretentious.)

119
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,800
(How evil.)

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,850
(Once you get the evidence,
you'll banish me to the Cold Palace,)

121
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,160
(and then my whole family
will be beheaded.)

122
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,370
(No.)

123
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,260
(That mustn't happen.)

124
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,780
(I must save my own life.)

125
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,800
Your Majesty, I'm so happy

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,440
to be in your favor.

127
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,990
Why would I make excuses?

128
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,310
I was a little
too excited just now.

129
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,930
Oh,

130
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,130
happiness comes too suddenly.

131
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,190

it is slippery beside the pond.

138
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,680
Your Majesty, you must be careful.

139
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,700
Don't worry.

140
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,280
