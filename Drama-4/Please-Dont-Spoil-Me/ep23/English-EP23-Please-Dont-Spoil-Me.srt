=Please Don't Spoil Me=
=Episode 23=

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,600
Brother Wen Chang,

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,340
look at these people.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,250
There are many scholars here.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,540
Pay attention to all of them.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,920
During the day of
the Imperial Examination,

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,880
you'll defeat them all.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,560
Look at this.

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,060
That young man.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,730
Who is this guy?

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,150
That is Yu Wen Bai,

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,410
the organizer of the poetry party.

13
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,130
That's him.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,530
He's Yu Wen Bai?

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,640
Yu Wen Bai,

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,730
nephew of the present
Prime Minister, Yu Wen Xun,

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,440
standard offspring of an officer.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,930
(Brother Wen Chang is here)

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,610
(for the poetry party
organized by Yu Wen Bai.)

20
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,000
(This is the House of Romance.)

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,160
(So, does that mean...)

22
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,610
Here's the top courtesan in the Capital,

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,430
Ding Xiao Xiao, Miss. Ding.

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,670
She'll be presenting
a dance for you all.

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,600
Isn't she pretty?

26
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,780
She's very pretty.

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,240
It's her.

28
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,210
Great!

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,460
Great!

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,700
Ladies and gentlemen,

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,700
after the show,

32
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,040
it's time

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,140
for today's main topic.

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,400
I am Yu Wen Bai,

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,290
and I'm honored to organize
a poetry party here.

36
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,460
I do this to have an exchange of ideas
with fellow scholars in the Yin Empire.

37
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,120
We should learn from each other.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,620
Whoever wins the competition today

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,890
with his poem

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,670
will be admired by Miss. Ding.

41
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,660
He can spend some time

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,680
with the top courtesan in the city.

43
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,360
I'll be waiting for you all inside.

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,950
I wish you all the best of luck.

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,510
Brother Wen Chang, it's your turn.

46
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,550
Where is he?

47
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,560
Where is he?

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,430
Brother Wen Chang!

49
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,620
Brother Wen Chang is there!

50
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,740
What are you doing?

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,920
Why are you this drunk?

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,270
What's wrong?

53
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,290
I don't know.

54
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,160
Such a great poet exists.

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,900
(Gazing on Mount Tai)
(Du Fu)

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,920
Didn't I ask you to look after him?

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,260
I...

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,030
Brother Wen Chang, it's your turn.

59
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,320
Wake up, Brother Wen Chang!

60
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,510
Brother Yue,

61
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,200
since Du Fu is here,

62
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,330
I should not embarrass myself
with my mediocre poem.

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,940
I should

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,480
go home.

65
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,770
I should go back!

66
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,390
All right, the poetry party
has officially begun.

67
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,220
I'm willing to be the first

68
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,180
in hope of inspiring others.

69
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,180
Which one of you

70
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,180
would like to come up
and compete with me?

71
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,760
We can't let Yu Wen Bai win.

72
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,620
You...

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,690
Look after him closely, all right?

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,390
I'll do it.

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,170
This young man looks handsome.

76
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,610
Yeah, he looks pretty.

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,300
What's she doing up there?

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
How do I address you, Sir?

79
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,890
Yue Chuan.

80
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,660
Oh, it's Brother Yue.

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,700
The rules of this poetry competition

82
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,710
are very simple. Best of three games.

83
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,300
You and I take turns to ask questions.

84
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,840
We will write our own poems,

85
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,930
and the audience will be the judge.

86
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,800
What do you think?

87
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,530
Fine. You first.

88
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,860
Great!

89
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,390
The first round

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,730
concerns the frontier fortress.

91
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,860
I already have mine in mind.

92
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,690
Brother Yue, feel free
to spend some time

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,250
to think of your poem.

94
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,630
No need. I'm ready.

95
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,530
The muddy lakeside road now lies
chapped amid winds of extreme freeze.

96
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,020
Their branches broken, the parasol trees
stripped of their withered leaves.

97
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,460
Though the armor is torn
in constant desert wars,

98
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,470
a red flag is all one sees,
marching up the snow-capped peak.

99
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,250
You...

100
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,560
Great!

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,890
What a great poem!

102
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,280
What's going on?

103
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,150
Wow, he's so cool!

104
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,640
What should I do, Tie Chui?

105
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,100
I think I've found true love again.

106
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,050
I'm done. It's your turn.

107
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,500
Hah,

108
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,650
I borrowed all of your poems

109
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,290
from the Internet,

110
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,740
and now that I read your poem
aloud before you,

111
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,510
you have nothing to compete against me.

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,020
Brother Yue is such a great poet

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,700
for being able to write
such a beautiful poem.

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,430
I shouldn't embarrass myself
with my mediocre poem.

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,010
Let's go to the next round.

116
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:37,990
Fine!

117
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,110
Then the theme of the second round

118
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,210
is about spring outing.

119
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,820
How about that?

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,720
Spring outing?

121
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,360
Fine. Let's do that then.

122
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,410
I'll go first.

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,990
Look at the wooded ridges,
deep blue dappled with red.

124
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,180
Look at the meadows,
an endless stretch of green.

125
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,690
Look at the visitors trampling about
right in front of the pavilion,

126
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,020
heedless of the fallen flowers
that betoken spring’s decline.

127
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,150
This is the poem I gave him!

128
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,940
What's going on?

129
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,650
I'll pass this round.

130
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,810
I have a great poem in my mind.

131
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,450
Yes, I know.

132
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,780
The twilight shines
on the Yangtze River,

133
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,950
and we invite each other
to row back to the dock.

134
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,150
The falling flowers seem
to have affection,

135
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,670
as it flows at the direction
of the boat.

136
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,620
Great!

137
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,890
Great!

138
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,240
How do you...

139
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,520
How do I what?

140
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,160
I spoke first.

141
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,410
There's no way I could've copied yours.

142
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,510
You're a great poet.

143
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,010
I admit defeat. Goodbye.

144
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

145
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,400
it looks like we have a winner today.

146
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,370
Mr. Yue, congratulations!

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,160
Thanks! Thanks!

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,500
Mr. Yue,

149
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,950
hurry upstairs.

150
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,360
You shouldn't let Miss. Ding
wait too long.

151
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,250
Sir, this way please.
