=Episode 17=

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,260
(Lan Xin Palace)

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,840
After eating hotpot, let's have
a cup of tea to wash it down.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,540
Your Highness, you're really
enjoying the food!

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,300
Oh, it's Eunuch Niu.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,800
Have a seat.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,920
Come and sit.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,160
Your Highness,

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,380
although you left
the Cold Palace not long ago,

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,600
you're suffering
this bad luck again.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,260
I feel so sad for you,

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,300
so, so sad.

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,140
Entering the Cold Palace is
a very happy thing for me.

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,800
Look how free it is here,

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,540
with the wine and meat
you're sending me.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,930
Life is good here!

17
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:39,910
Your Highness,

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,560
I can't speak for others,

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,100
but on the aspect of food,

20
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,920
if there's anything you want,

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,130
just let me know.

22
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,070
I'll get it for you.

23
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,620
I do in fact have a few special dishes

24
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,760
that I want you to get for me.

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,110
Sure!

26
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,730
Come here.

27
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,160
Aortas and tripe.

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,040
Tripe?

29
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,420
Aortas?

30
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,360
You know, from the cow's stomach.

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,290
Your Highness,

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:09,810
this...

33
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,690
I don't dare to bring

34
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,980
such dirty things to the Palace!

35
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,070
If the nobles find out,

36
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,310
I...

37
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,750
Upon my return to the Cold Palace,

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,880
I don't feel so good.

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,020
I wanted to write a few poems
with these emotions.

40
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,250
- But unfortunately...
- Your Highness,

41
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,340
I am in charge of the Cold Palace.

42
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,400
It is my duty to

43
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,200
improve the living conditions
in the Cold Palace,

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,630
and that includes the diet.

45
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,150
Your Highness,
if there's anything you need,

46
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,930
just let me know.

47
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,820
I'll get it done.

48
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,240
But...

49
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,360
All I ask is that you don't
stop your passion for poetry.

50
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,230
Fu Ling, ready my brush and ink.

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,680
Have a look.

52
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,460
A mountain range from the front
looks like peaks from the side.

53
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,940
Its physique changes when
viewed from various angles.

54
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,760
Your Highness, have some tea.

55
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,610
No one can see
the true face of Lu Mountain,

56
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,410
for they are in the mountain themselves.

57
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,490
Your Highness,

58
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,600
this poem seems to be about scenery,

59
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,000
but it actually has a profound meaning.

60
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,290
Your Highness,
you can simply write anything

61
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,800
without hesitation.

62
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,580
You're truly a genius poet!

63
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,760
You flatter me.

64
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,110
Your Highness,

65
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,520
there's something I don't understand.

66
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,350
(Su Shi)
Why do you sign it with "Su Shi"?

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,140
The author is Su Shi.

68
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,830
It's natural that I sign it
with "Su Shi".

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,410
I remember that you've used "Li Bai",

70
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,440
"Du Fu",

71
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,680
and also "Meng Hao Ran".

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,800
Why did you change
the name again this time?

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,780
Well, different poems

74
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,010
naturally have different authors.

75
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,720
Oh, you won't understand.

76
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,220
Yes, I don't understand.

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,400
Um, Your Highness,

78
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,560
I feel like you're very inspired today.

79
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,990
Can you write a couple more
poems for me?

80
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,160
To be honest,

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,500
after reading your poems,

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,560
everyone else's are

83
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,100
boring and plain to me.

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,180
Sure.

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,160
That's great.

86
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,050
Your Majesty.

87
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,880
How is Concubine Rong doing
in the Cold Palace?

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,100
Is she feeling restless,

89
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,560
like she's missing someone very much?

90
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,150
No, no, Your Majesty.

91
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,570
Not at all.

92
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,710
Concubine Rong

93
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,100
took out the hotpot

94
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,380
that she asked someone to make,

95
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,940
and is having a good meal.

96
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,830
She's also reciting poetry

97
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,480
with the Cold Palace's
General Officer Niu De Yi.

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,000
She looks very happy.

99
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,650
Zhao Xiao Wu!

100
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,030
Stop talking!

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,450
She's very happy?

102
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,680
That's not right.

103
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,060
Your Majesty,

104
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,120
Concubine Rong has only been
in the Cold Palace for a day.

105
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,700
It's only normal that

106
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,880
she hasn't started to miss anyone.

107
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,570
Is it normal?

108
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,980
But why do I...

109
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,630
Fine.

110
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,050
I want to see

111
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,920
how long Concubine Rong can last.

112
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,350
Good poem. Good poem!

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,520
But, Eunuch,

114
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,650
why is Her Highness's signature

115
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,020
different every time?

116
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,490
Throughout history, literati have always

117
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,620
used pseudonyms when writing poems.

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,380
Every name has a different meaning.

119
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,390
A scholar like Her Highness

120
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,460
is not someone that you and I...

121
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,120
She is not someone that
people like you can try to fathom.

122
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,440
Eunuch, you're brilliant.

123
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,880
I wonder,

124
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,590
Her Highness has given me so many poems,

125
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,740
how should I repay her?

126
