00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,290
Where did you get this jade pendant?

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,860
I'm asking you. Where
did you get this jade pendant?

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,230
What's wrong with you?

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,780
It's mine!

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,870
What do you mean by
"where did I get it"?

7
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,360
It's you.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,410
No, it's not.

9
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,500
It is you.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,510
I said it's not me.

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,360
Alright.

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,810
I want to see

13
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,210
how you'll deny it like this.

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,180
♪The light illuminates
the corners of the room♪

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,490
What's wrong with you?

16
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,610
I just wanted to confirm

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,810
if you're the one who saved me
that day in the bamboo forest.

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,360
Who even confirms something this way?

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,640
You're just a perverted hooligan!

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,990
Besides,

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,780
so what if I saved you?

22
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,370
Is it illegal to save someone?

23
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,430
♪Without a care in the world♪

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,100
It really is you.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,580
Yes, it's me.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,930
Didn't you suspect me of stealing?

27
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,250
If I wanted that piece of trash,

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,810
I could've stolen it a thousand times

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,510
when you passed out in the cabin!

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,950
Would I have to wait until now?

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,270
I'm sorry I blamed you
for something you didn't do.

32
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,830
What's the use of being sorry?

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,910
Do you know how stressed
I've been lately?

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,630
I travelled here all of a sudden,

35
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,380
being constantly in fear, afraid that
I won't be able to complete the task,

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,390
and I still have to quarrel with
scheming people like you!

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,380
I was afraid the poison in your body
might not be completely cleared,

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,950
so I sat there and
boiled the medicine for you

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,960
until my eyes were red.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,420
It's fine if you don't appreciate it,

41
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,290
but now you want to kill me?

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,670
You can't even keep
your hands to yourself!

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,610
Is this how you should
treat your savior?

44
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,260
I can explain...

45
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,520
Explain what?

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,810
All you people know

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,060
is to join forces to bully others.

48
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,090
You're all awful people!

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,570
I...

50
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,340
I what?

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,400
So what if you're the Emperor?

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,950
Hooligan, fool, scumbag!

53
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,640
I don't want to see you!

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,900
Get out of my sight!

55
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,370
Go!

56
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,580
Concubine Rong! Concubine Rong!

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,590
Concubine Rong!

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,100
Leave!

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,960
Rong...

60
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,800
Concubine Rong wasn't the one
who touched the mechanism.

61
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,070
Someone else

62
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,090
has infiltrated this place.

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,940
Zhao Xiao Wu.

64
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,330
Take the footprint down.

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
But

67
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,490
the footprint is too light.

68
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,330
You can't even see its full shape.

69
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,460
But the infiltrator doesn't know that.

70
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,980
Your Majesty, I found out

71
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,100
it was indeed a guard on duty.

72
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,310
He admitted that he

73
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,820
used the excuse of relieving himself

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,470
to infiltrate the chamber
with the intention to steal.

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,930
However, just before he succeeded,

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,470
Concubine Rong happened to
show up with the medicine.

77
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,070
So instead of stealing the map,

78
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,040
he was scared away.

79
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,640
It turns out

80
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,820
she helped me again.

81
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,780
(Hua Ge Yuan Yun)

82
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,300
Cai Yun.

83
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,220
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,830
Did anything interesting
happen in the Palace lately?

85
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,670
Tell me something to relieve my boredom.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,010
I heard that

87
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,210
His Majesty went to
Concubine Rong's palace last night.

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,060
The two of them had a huge fight,

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,050
and Concubine Rong even
ended up chasing His Majesty out.

90
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,680
What?

91
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,810
Your Highness, please wait.

92
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,590
I'll go check on your breakfast.

93
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,870
Hurry up, I'm starving.

94
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,630
Yes, Your Highness.

95
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,640
That jerk Qin Yu.

96
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,320
No good deed goes unpunished.

97
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,620
Actually, it's not exactly his fault.

98
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,600
This deployment map
is extremely important.

99
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,610
I was sending the medicine

100
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,020
at the wrong place and the wrong time,

101
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,600
hence the coincidence.

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,900
It would be strange
if I was not suspected.

103
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,930
Wait a second.

104
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,440
Why should I stand up for him?

105
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,120
He was so mean to me last night.

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,260
I will not forgive him no matter what.

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,590
Concubine Rong, my dear sister.

108
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,150
You were out of the Palace
visiting parents for a few days.

109
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,740
I've missed you so much.

110
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,530
I'm here to visit you today.

111
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,900
Why?

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,330
Am I not welcomed here?

113
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,990
That's enough with you.

114
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,890
If you have something to say,
spit it out.

115
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,660
If not, then get lost.

116
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm about to have my breakfast.

117
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,240
Oh, I wonder who it was

118
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,270
that had a huge fight
with His Majesty yesterday,

119
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,930
and even chased him out.

120
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,980
How are you still in the mood
to have breakfast?

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,280
Yan Yi Yi, Yan Yi Yi.

122
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,030
I don't know if I should
call you careless

123
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,210
or stupid.

124
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,030
Get lost!

125
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,160
What are you going to do about it?

126
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,140
Alright, I want to see

127
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,000
how long you can stay happy like this

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,030
after making such a huge mistake.

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,510
