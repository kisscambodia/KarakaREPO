1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,381
Wait.

2
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,049
What?

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,843
What are you doing?

4
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,219
Let's go, Ms. Shin Ha-ri.

5
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,557
What did you just call me?

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,811
I mean…

7
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,314
How did you…

8
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,732
I know

9
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,318
that you're Shin Ha-ri.

10
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,403
So let's just go

11
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,363
to the police station first.

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,160
Shin Ha-ri, right?

13
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,161
Yes.

14
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,621
When is she getting here?

15
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,040
She said that she was almost here.

16
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,374
Ha-ri!

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,586
I mean, Geum-hui.

18
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:33,843
Just come here.

19
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,222
What happened?

20
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,140
I don't know.

21
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:44,646
Can you confirm
the footage you're about to see

22
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,814
is of yourselves?

23
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,399
Still, isn't it pretty?

24
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,568
Yes, I guess so.

25
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,487
Yes, that's us.

26
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,532
Unbelievable.

27
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,494
What?

28
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,414
Fortunately, there was
no more footage after this scene.

29
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,583
What a relief.

30
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,586
So? What's going to happen
to the bastard who took these videos?

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,796
He'll be arrested, right?

32
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,091
With something of this level,
he'll probably just be fined.

33
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,175
What?

34
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,343
How could that be?

35
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,012
He clearly approached me
to take secret videos of me.

36
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,264
He's only getting fined?

37
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,932
It upsets us too.

38
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,519
-But that is what the law currently says.
-But, still…

39
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,898
How can he only get a fine?

40
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,608
There they go.

41
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,360
Right? It makes no sense.

42
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,572
That man who installed the hidden camera…

43
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,490
Get me his personal information.

44
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,117
But why, sir?

45
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,668
I realized
that I don't know much about you.

46
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,128
My grandfather could ask about it.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,756
Come to think of it, even since then…

48
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,511
balance the nutrition perfectly,
and make it commercially successful!

49
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,638
Again.

50
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,973
Again!

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,143
So he was already aware
that I was Shin Geum-hui…

52
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,148
and invited me to the Founding
Anniversary Ceremony on purpose?

53
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,278
No way.

54
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,030
You're

55
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,448
fired.

56
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,993
I don't work for you.

57
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,078
Who are you to tell me that I'm fired?

58
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,748
I am the president.

59
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,542
I found out
that you're an employee at UKay.

60
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,211
And I'll be buying the company out.

61
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,590
On one condition.

62
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,426
They must fire Shin Jeong-u,
who illegally filmed two women.

63
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,762
Wait, what?

64
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,096
I saw that this isn't

65
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,515
the first time you've done this.

66
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,817
What should I even say?

67
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,446
I'm also a victim of Shin Jeong-u.

68
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,367
He set up a hidden camera
and filmed me secretly.

69
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,535
I want him to pay for his crimes.

70
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,583
There are a lot of victims
of your illegal filming.

71
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,544
I'll find every one of them
and file a lawsuit accordingly.

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,511
On top of that, if your attempt
to destroy the evidence is added,

73
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,597
you'll be serving time
in prison for a long time.

74
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,515
Wait.

75
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,850
How did you get…

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,396
You've managed to make it this far
without getting caught.

77
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,190
But unfortunately,

78
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,817
you ran into me.

79
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,404
And as you can see, I'm rich, persistent,

80
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,489
and smart.

81
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,202
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,372
Please forgive me just once. Have mercy.

83
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,625
I still have a lot of years to live.

84
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,210
I can't go to prison.

85
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,253
You have no shame.

86
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,091
Have you ever thought about your victims
who've been forced to live with the burden

87
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,260
of unknowingly being filmed?

88
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,893
After serving time, it'll be hard
for you to get a job anywhere.

89
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,646
Please have mercy. Please…

90
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,606
Hey!

91
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,278
Why are you doing all of this?
This has nothing to do with you!

92
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,785
You…

93
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,664
messed with someone
you should've never messed with.

94
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,044
You piece of trash.

95
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,256
Hey, Young-seo. Did you get to work okay?

96
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,425
No, I'm not worried.

97
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,885
I know how strong you are.

98
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,264
Make sure to call me
if you don't want to be alone at night.

99
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,058
-Son of a bitch.
-Bastard.

100
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,309
I feel much better now.

101
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,770
Yes. You seem pretty angry too, Mr. Cha.

102
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,687
What?

103
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,647
I think you're a lot more upset, sir.

104
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,607
What?

105
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,111
Well, who wouldn't be upset
in a situation like this?

106
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,988
-Indeed.
-Yes.

107
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,906
Ms. Shin!

108
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,823
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

109
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,116
Hello.

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,785
-Did you just get here?
-Yes.

111
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,788
It's President Kang.

112
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,707
His face is like a company perk.

113
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,293
I wonder who will end up
marrying a guy like that--

114
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,587
Ms. Shin?

115
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,671
Ms. Shin--

116
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,050
Hello.

117
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,852
Hello. I mean, goodbye.

118
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,941
-Go up first.
-What?

119
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,526
Good morning.

120
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,443
Hello.

121
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,240
Is Ms. Shin not here yet?

122
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,533
Yes, she's not here yet.

123
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,992
-What?
-Why?

124
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,454
I saw Ms. Shin on the first floor earlier.

125
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,872
Then why isn't she here yet?

126
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,041
I thought she'd be here already.

127
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,419
Right. I asked her
for some data yesterday.

128
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,762
Damn it.

129
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,578
I can't live like this.
It's so nerve-racking.

130
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,378
Don't we have things to talk about?
Let's meet after work.

131
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,051
What? What about Ms. Shin?

132
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,722
Didn't you hear me?
I've developed feelings for Ms. Shin.

133
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,141
No wonder.

134
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,268
How did this happen?

135
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,187
Not long ago, you were really angry…

136
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,317
and wanted to get back at her.
What's happened?

137
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,195
I think I've been attracted to her
ever since I first met her.

138
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,697
Seeing how I decided to marry her.

139
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,116
The woman you wanted to marry
was Shin Geum-hui.

140
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,952
How are they different?

141
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:15,995
Pardon?

142
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,540
Other than the fake backstory
and the lame disguise,

143
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,917
she was the real Shin Ha-ri.

144
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,337
I also like
that she's a dedicated researcher.

145
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,423
So what are you going to do now?

146
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,341
What do you mean?

147
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,384
I'll tell her.

148
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,344
What?

149
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,685
What do you think?
Do you think she'll like it?

150
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,812
Sir, aren't you taking things too fast?

151
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,273
To confess your feelings
without the proper buildup…

152
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,151
Who would possibly reject me
if I said I liked them?

153
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,070
I like how confident you are, but--

154
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,947
-I take this one.
-Yes, sir.

155
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,184
Ms. Shin, do you want
to start seeing each other

156
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,894
with marriage in mind?

157
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,481
I told you, I'm good at a lot of things.

158
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,652
Will this do?

159
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:30,987
Yes.

160
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,532
I'll signal by putting my fingers
up to my forehead like this. Thank you.

161
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,449
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,220
President Kang.

163
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,140
Please, sit.

164
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,326
Let's eat first.

165
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,245
No, I don't want to eat.

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,590
I am sincerely sorry
for lying to you this whole time.

167
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,510
From the very beginning,
I didn't approach you deliberately.

168
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,347
If I had known
that you'd be my blind date,

169
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,556
I never would have gone.

170
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,602
And after that,
I got tangled up in that contract--

171
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,145
It's fine.

172
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,148
I didn't call you here
to hear you say that.

173
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,902
Now, what I was going to say is…

174
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,156
No. Hear me out first.

175
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,579
RESIGNATION LETTER

176
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,082
A resignation letter?

177
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,170
Are you handing in your resignation?

178
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,675
All the things you did to me
since you found out that I'm Shin Geum-hui

179
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,718
was to fire me, right?

180
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,639
Fine. I understand that you're mad.

181
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,768
But, even though I wronged you personally,

182
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,854
I did nothing wrong as an employee.

183
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,897
So…

184
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,983
please give me one more chance.

185
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,154
-A chance?
-Please listen to my presentation.

186
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,783
After that, you can decide if you want
to accept my resignation or not.

187
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,784
A presentation?

188
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,545
I have compiled all of the contributions
that I've made for the company.

189
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,672
You have two choices.

190
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,092
First, you could fire me,
a competent employee, for personal reasons

191
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,636
and then regret it for a long time.

192
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,221
Or, as a second option,

193
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:06,392
you could take advantage of my abilities
and have me work really hard

194
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,977
until the day I retire.

195
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,398
This isn't why I called you here.

196
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,234
What?

197
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,283
This is the bindaetteok that I came up
with right after I started working.

198
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,952
It was praised for its traditional taste.

199
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,664
And this is the Bucket List Sandwich,
which I also proposed.

200
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,166
Or the K-Pop Sandwich.

201
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,503
And this is the Bucket List Fish
that's top-ranked in the market.

202
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,839
It was also produced by me.

203
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,468
As you can see, I am an excellent employee
who helped produce so many products,

204
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,721
and the youngest employee
to ever receive the Mega Hit Award.

205
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,141
Will you really cast me aside

206
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,768
because you want to get back at me?

207
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,377
What? A presentation?

208
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,216
Stop it.

209
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,676
So what did you tell her?

210
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,677
What do you think?

211
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,055
I said that I would think about it.

212
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,432
How can she

213
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,060
not see me in a romantic light?

214
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,063
I'm handsome, tall, and rich.
What do I not have?

215
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,105
There's one thing.

216
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,444
That heart-pounding charm.

217
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,198
Ms. Shin's heart is currently beating
for another man.

218
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,744
She said that one-sided crush was over.

219
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,331
But it takes time to open up
your heart to somebody else.

220
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,417
Besides, the setup of the relationship
between you and Ms. Shin

221
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,378
is basically the worst.

222
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,004
What? How--

223
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:04,176
Because, to Ms. Shin, you're simply
a terrifying boss who tried to fire her.

224
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,928
I don't think it was that bad.

225
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,015
I mean, we did have some romantic moments.

226
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,977
That was when you were
on fake dates during a fake relationship.

227
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,357
From now on,
you need to make real situations.

228
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,651
Real situations?

229
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,576
RECIPE RESEARCH NOTES

230
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,871
Why isn't he reaching out to me?

231
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,748
Damn it.

232
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,210
Should I have begged him to not fire me?

233
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,214
President Kang?

234
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,593
INCOMING CALL
YOO-RA

235
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,970
Why is she calling me all of a sudden?

236
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,638
Congratulations.

237
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,932
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

238
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,142
Congratulations.

239
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,400
LIMITED TIME SPECIAL OFFER
GET A NEW PHONE NOW

240
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,028
Going on television
and having a product released.

241
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,487
One meal will never cut it.

242
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,574
Yeong-jun, why are you
making a big deal out of it?

243
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,868
This is all thanks to Ha-ri
who recommended him.

244
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,620
He should be treating her, if anybody.

245
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,706
No, it's all because Min-woo
did everything so well.

246
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,334
I do owe you. You got me this TV spot

247
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,004
to make me more recognizable
since I'm the least popular chef.

248
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,092
Still, like Ha-ri said, you wouldn't
have made it if you weren't good.

249
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,886
Anyway, thank you, Ha-ri.

250
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,307
I'll go get some more snacks.

251
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,060
I'm going to get another bottle of wine.

252
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,523
Those two are impressive.

253
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,692
How many times have they broken up?

254
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,112
I don't get Yoo-ra, who wanted to
get back together after breaking up,

255
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,989
or Min-woo, who accepted her back.

256
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,949
Stop it.

257
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,577
Honestly, I thought that
Min-woo would end up dating Ha-ri.

258
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,996
Me too. Weren't you two a thing?

259
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,581
What?

260
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,791
No!

261
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,627
"A thing"?
Stop saying stupid things like that.

262
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,588
Watch your mouth, okay?

263
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,175
What are you guys talking about?

264
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,386
Nothing, we didn't talk about much.

265
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,931
By the way,
are you two doing anything this weekend?

266
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,225
-Do you want to go on a trip together?
-A trip?

267
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,063
Oh, Min-woo's TV program
is filming in Busan.

268
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,774
Da-hye, Ji-min and I
are going to go with him.

269
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,403
I'm really sorry,
but I'm busy this weekend.

270
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,697
You have something too, right?

271
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,949
-What? Me?
-Yes.

272
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,326
Oh, yes, right.

273
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,371
By the way, Ha-ri,
you've been staring at your phone.

274
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
-Did you get a boyfriend?
-What?

275
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,501
Of course, Ha-ri doesn't have a boyfriend.

276
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,879
Ha-ri, your standards are too high.
Maybe you should lower them.

277
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,880
-Right.
-Guys!

278
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,093
Ha-ri does have a boyfriend.

279
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,761
-Really?
-What?

280
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,346
What are you doing? Sit down.

281
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,393
He's super handsome,
really nice to Ha-ri, very tall,

282
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,313
and he comes from a really rich family.

283
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,942
You're going on a date
with him this weekend too, right?

284
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,360
-I did?
-Yes.

285
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,071
Hey, Min-woo.

286
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,366
They say Ha-ri has a boyfriend.
Did you know?

287
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,455
Are you dating the guy
that you went to the concert with?

288
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,081
What?

289
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,958
Yes.

290
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,377
-You went to a concert together?
-What? With who?

291
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,212
Really? Hey, show us a picture!

292
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,964
Let's see a picture.

293
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,174
Later.

294
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:34,428
Yes, guys, later.
He's better-looking in person.

295
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,431
Do you guys not believe me?

296
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,434
I can't believe you.
Why would you lie like that back there?

297
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,269
I was just annoyed by Yoo-ra.

298
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:46,774
Where's the guy that I'm seeing
who's very tall, handsome, and rich?

299
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,067
I want to see him too.

300
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,777
You know who I'm talking about.

301
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,196
-Kang Tae-moo. Although it's fake.
-What?

302
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,240
I'm just saying, I wish you would
just date Kang Tae-moo

303
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,159
and crush Yoo-ra, that's all.

304
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,328
What are you talking about?

305
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,373
I'm about to get fired by Kang Tae-moo.

306
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,962
Don't worry. Even if you get fired,
I'll beg my father to help you get a job.

307
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,924
Did I drink too much wine?
My stomach hurts.

308
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm going to the bathroom.

309
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,635
It hurts.

310
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,476
Jeez.

311
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,699
I'm just going to go once I'm back home.

312
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,036
Damn it.

313
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,122
Come see me in my office.

314
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,026
Did you not sleep well?

315
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,986
What?

316
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,531
Yes, I guess.

317
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,658
You were so confident before,

318
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,452
but I guess you were worried
you'd get fired.

319
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,374
I'll be fine with whatever decision
you've made, sir.

320
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,880
That's a good stance.

321
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,552
RESIGNATION LETTER

322
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,903
Like you said, it would be my loss
to fire a useful employee like you

323
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,321
because of a personal reason.

324
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,533
Thank you, thank you so much!

325
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,370
I will work as hard as I can. Thank you!

326
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,496
See you after work.

327
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,042
I've been working on a project
for a new product in secret.

328
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,335
After work?

329
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,879
Is that a problem?

330
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,382
What happened to that employee
who just told me she would work

331
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,967
as hard as she can?

332
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,136
No. She's right here.

333
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,805
Then I'll see you later. Thank you, sir.

334
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,830
Why does he want to see me after work?

335
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,709
Well, that doesn't matter.

336
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,336
I didn't get fired!

337
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,970
This one's better, right?

338
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,764
Okay, so we're done with this product.

339
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,808
Let's start on the next product
after a break.

340
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,977
-Okay.
-I'm going to the bathroom real quick.

341
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,186
Sure.

342
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,064
By the way,
don't you hate the bathroom here?

343
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,858
Right? It's a unisex bathroom.
It makes me uncomfortable.

344
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,112
I shouldn't drink this
if I don't want to go to the bathroom.

345
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,701
Hi, babies!

346
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,331
This is from a super expensive
and famous shop.

347
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,097
Hello, how are you?

348
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,026
Yes, that sounds great.

349
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,345
Ms. Jin. I can't believe it.

350
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,306
Why do you keep getting
the same clothes as me?

351
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,309
I think you're the one
who's doing that actually.

352
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,561
That makes no sense.

353
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,148
I'm sure that the employee said
that this was the last one.

354
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,692
-Is that really what they said?
-Yes.

355
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,194
Oh, my.

356
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:46,323
When I went to buy it, the employee
said that there were just two pieces left.

357
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,078
So I bought it before you, right?

358
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,925
What kind of new product is it that
you wanted to see me at a movie theater?

359
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,260
I don't have a detailed plan yet,

360
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,346
so I asked to see you here
to clear my head.

361
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,349
Then shouldn't we discuss
the new product first?

362
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,602
Do you think I asked to see you
at a theater just to clear my head?

363
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,314
The main character in this movie
is a researcher at a food company.

364
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,400
I'm preparing to localize
our products in the US,

365
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,820
so won't it be helpful
to see what researchers do

366
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,071
in the United States?

367
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,118
I see. So you're saying that

368
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,621
since I can't go abroad in person,

369
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:38,333
it would be helpful to indirectly
experience it through a movie, right?

370
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,043
That's right.

371
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,879
Sure, I think it'll be helpful.

372
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,134
I only saw places like these on TV shows.

373
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,886
What do you want to eat?

374
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,477
They all look good.

375
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,937
Then let's order all of them.

376
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,987
By the way, there's nobody here.

377
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,156
Of course. I rented the entire place.

378
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,117
What? The entire place? Why?

379
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,287
I've always hated crowded places.

380
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,873
Unbelievable.

381
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,463
Want a glass of wine?

382
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,970
My chair isn't working.

383
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,224
Let me see.

384
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,157
Wait.

385
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,201
I'm going to the bathroom.

386
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,919
Gosh, my heart skips a beat
at the smallest things.

387
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,467
You haven't dated in a long time.
Shin Ha-ri.

388
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,222
Far too long.

389
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,599
Sure.

390
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,434
Ms. Shin?

391
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,854
What are you two doing here?

392
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,483
What do you mean? We're here
to watch a movie at the movie theater.

393
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,278
Mr. Gye kept telling me that
he had a VIP ticket or something.

394
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,491
-I see.
-Turns out that ticket was for today.

395
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,493
It would've been a waste to throw it away.

396
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:40,080
but the easiest person
who I could think of calling was Ms. Yeo.

397
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,374
So I let her come with me. Yes.

398
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,625
That's what happened.

399
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,085
Okay.

400
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,002
"The easiest"?

401
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,421
I came here because you begged me.
Should I just go?

402
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,258
Hey, don't be like that.
You're already here.

403
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,594
Are you here by yourself?

404
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,014
Yes.

405
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,309
It's not like
I have a boyfriend or anything.

406
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,979
Movies are best watched alone, right?

407
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,690
I'll go to watch the movie, then.

408
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,276
I'll see you at work tomorrow. Bye.

409
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,862
Shall we go in too?

410
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,201
President Kang.

411
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,586
Did she go over there?

412
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,048
That's the pricey theater.
Why would she go over there alone?

413
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,383
Did she go over here?

414
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,844
President Kang. We have a big problem.

415
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,887
-What?
-We have to be careful when we leave.

416
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,308
-I just met Ms. Yeo and--
-Ms. Shin?

417
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,103
Why, Ms. Yeo?

418
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,942
Why are you here?

419
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:51,860
Gosh.

420
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,197
Look at this.

421
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,455
This place is awesome.

422
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,748
Right?

423
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,250
Are you waiting for somebody?

424
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,835
No.

425
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:13,089
I booked two seats so I could watch
the movie comfortably by myself.

426
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,468
Flex, right.

427
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:21,639
Flexing like this sometimes
is really good for de-stressing.

428
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,568
Gosh, this is--

429
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,112
I think the movie
is supposed to start soon.

430
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,405
You two should go.

431
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,992
This is so much food for just one person!

432
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,204
How about we join you?

433
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,580
No! That's not--

434
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,915
-Let's go.
-It's starting.

435
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,083
I, that's, no--

436
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,834
Come on, where's your conscience?

437
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,419
You can go watch it by yourself.

438
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,420
Darn it.

439
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,133
-It's starting.
-Right.

440
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,055
-It reclines.
-Really?

441
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,934
The popcorn's delicious.

442
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,334
Thank you for your hard work.

443
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,344
I've been out on business all day,
so I couldn't go to the bathroom.

444
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,806
What am I doing?

445
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,059
I really need to go.

446
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,812
When is the bus coming?

447
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,192
Save me, God.

448
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,079
What?

449
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,250
Thank you for helping me catch the guy
who had secretly filmed me.

450
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,461
I didn't even get to thank you properly.

451
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,378
It's fine.

452
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,630
I did what anybody would have done.

453
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,804
Are you all right?

454
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,222
What?

455
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,226
Of course. It wasn't a big deal.

456
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,446
It should be over by now.

457
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,002
They said that it will awaken
the desire to be in a relationship.

458
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,213
What a lie. Don't you think so?

459
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,509
-Are you crying?
-But the female lead died.

460
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:07,806
And she even had the same name
as my younger sister who passed away.

461
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,683
Sujeong.

462
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,897
Mr. Gye must have
a younger sister who died.

463
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,526
Younger sister, my foot.
He used to have a dog named Sujeong.

464
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,653
Poor Sujeong.

465
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,365
I didn't even get to be with her
when she passed.

466
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,450
I'm so sorry!

467
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,329
If a dog lived to be 20 years old
and even had a great-grandson,

468
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,039
it had a much better life than you.

469
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,415
Who's pitying who now?

470
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,752
Why haven't they parted ways yet?

471
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,342
Unbelievable.

472
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,515
Yes, sir.

473
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,184
Is the movie over?

474
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,606
Yes. But Mr. Gye wanted to
have a drink, so I'm on my way there.

475
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,941
Did you go back home?

476
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,527
Of course.

477
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,114
Did you think that I'd be waiting for you?

478
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,448
Here? With nothing to do?

479
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,034
What are you doing, Ms. Shin? Let's go.

480
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,828
Coming.

481
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:16,332
I'll let you know about the report
once I've submitted it. Bye.

482
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,383
A report?

483
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,012
The traffic's pretty bad.

484
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,435
-Are you hot?
-What?

485
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,770
Yes, a bit.

486
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,315
Could I open the window?

487
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,357
Sure.

488
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,784
You need to hold it in, Young-seo.

489
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,829
Think about something
other than the bathroom.

490
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,458
Today is Monday, right?
So tomorrow starts with a T, toilet day--

491
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,168
What? No.

492
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,544
Think about something else.

493
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,255
Excuse me.

494
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,425
Could you turn on some music?

495
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,760
Music?

496
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,723
This is my delight

497
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,809
Thus to wait and watch at the wayside

498
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,479
Where shadow chases light

499
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,940
And the rain comes
In the wake of the summer

500
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,358
I'm getting off here!

501
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,443
What? Here?

502
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,402
Yes.

503
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,363
I think I need to get off.

504
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,740
Why would you get off
in the middle of the road--

505
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,076
What I'm saying is…

506
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,620
Are you all right?

507
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,123
If I stay in here any longer…

508
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,128
I'll probably relieve myself in the car.

509
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,005
What?

510
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,424
Goodbye, then.

511
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,262
Wait. Ms. Jin!

512
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,522
Bathroom.

513
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,733
Jin Young-seo, hold it.
You can hold it. You can do it.

514
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,488
I'm going to die of embarrassment.

515
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,825
Bathroom!

516
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,160
Now I'm feeling a number two too.

517
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,579
I'm going crazy!

518
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:22,917
What?

519
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,628
Dear God, dear Buddha.

520
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,714
What have I done that was so horrible?

521
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,844
Why did you chase me all the way here?

522
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,513
I was worried.
Why haven't you gone inside yet?

523
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,556
The door is locked.

524
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,143
Go away, quick.
I really could do it right here.

525
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,561
Hold on.

526
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,404
What?

527
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,489
-Get in. Quickly.
-Wait, slowly.

528
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,454
Mr. Cha, you should go first!

529
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,240
Why is it so hard to go on just one date?

530
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,457
What excuse should I use
to call her next time?

531
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:57,261
SHIN HA-RI

532
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,514
Why are there so many people
with the same name?

533
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,733
The plan for the second half
of this year is the following.

534
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:15,822
Expand the size of our online platform
to 300 percent of what it is currently.

535
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,951
We expect the profits of this to be
about 80 billion won.

536
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,912
After discussing this through a meeting
with the consulting firm…

537
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,539
She was cute when she was young too.

538
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,165
Our online platform is not easy to use

539
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,502
when compared to the rest of the market
and other companies' systems.

540
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,672
Also, according to our customers,

541
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,341
we don't have
detailed descriptions of our products

542
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,969
and many other inconvenient aspects.

543
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,971
This is an area we need to fix.

544
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,015
Ms. Shin. We're going on
a business trip together.

545
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,642
Be prepared.

546
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,191
GANGWONDO

547
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,485
One, two, three.

548
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,737
Congratulations.

549
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,073
Congratulations, sir.

550
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,368
Lastly, this is the grand ballroom.

551
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,245
Gosh, it looks incredible.

552
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,249
Chairman Kang, thank you for coming
and staying with me until the end.

553
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,709
No problem.

554
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,753
You probably have a lot of guests.
I should let you go.

555
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,631
-I hope you have a pleasant time, then.
-Yes, thank you.

556
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,799
Let's go.

557
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,638
-Sung-hoon.
-Yes, sir.

558
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,141
-Do I have anything else for today?
-No, sir.

559
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,686
It's been a while
since we've come all the way to Sokcho.

560
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,771
Let's go fishing by the ocean.

561
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,774
Go fishing with Sung-hoon.
I have another engagement today.

562
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,817
What?

563
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,736
Why do you always--

564
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,489
Really?

565
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,118
Okay, then take care of your business,

566
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,120
and I'll see you in Seoul, okay?

567
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,665
Just stay the night over, okay?

568
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,042
Come back tomorrow.

569
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,835
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

570
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,794
All right, then.

571
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,879
Yes.

572
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,548
I'll see you in Seoul, sir.

573
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,927
Hey, Sung-hoon. Come over here.

574
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,803
Hey.

575
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:09,393
Tae-moo's "engagement" is
taking Ms. Shin Geum-hui on a date, right?

576
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,772
-What?
-Tell him to go on a lot of dates.

577
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:18,152
It would be even better
if they come back with a great-grandson.

578
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,782
Hey, let's go. Let's go fishing.

579
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,866
Come on, let's go.

580
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,621
When he finds out that Shin Geum-hui
is actually Shin Ha-ri--

581
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,213
I can't believe that
I'm going on a business trip…

582
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,174
on my precious weekend.

583
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,635
I brought this on myself.

584
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,179
Ha-ri, you idiot.

585
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,224
We're on our way.

586
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,977
Ha-ri and Young-seo,
I wish that you guys could come, too.

587
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,814
Ha-ri said she has a date with
her boyfriend.

588
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,399
Have fun on your date.

589
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,485
Thanks. Have fun on your trip.

590
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,202
Yes, sir. I just got here. Where are you?

591
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,453
I see you.

592
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:10,871
You can see me?

593
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,391
Gosh. He looks so cool.

594
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,315
You're here for work.
Come to your senses, Ha-ri.

595
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,824
Why did you ask me to come to Sokcho?

596
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:51,203
Did you get an idea for that new product?

597
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,999
Sokcho has a lot of good dishes,

598
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,501
so I thought
that I might get an idea as I'm eating.

599
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,047
I actually did a lot of research
on the famous restaurants in Sokcho.

600
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,302
Let's go to the one that I found first.

601
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,762
Sure.

602
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,264
Give me your bag and wait in the car.

603
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,682
No. It's all right.

604
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,653
Also, according to our customers,

605
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,032
we don't have
detailed descriptions of our products

606
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,909
and many other inconvenient aspects.

607
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,702
This is an area we need to fix.

608
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,745
I WANT TO VISIT SOKCHO
AND HAVE DELICIOUS FOOD

609
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,880
What are you doing?

610
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,924
I can drive.

611
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:49,303
-But I should drive--
-No. I can't let you drive, sir.

612
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,514
I'm a great driver. Don't worry.

613
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,657
Where shall I take you, Mr. Kang?

614
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,787
SOKCHO MAKGUKSU

615
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,705
Looking for the route

616
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,457
-I really wanted to go here.
-…with the least travel time.

617
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,000
-Is that so?
-Yes.

618
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,212
Then why don't we take our time
and go on a drive along the sea?

619
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,797
Go on a drive?

620
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,966
We don't have the time for that, sir.

621
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,426
-Seatbelt.
-What?

622
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,261
Put on your seatbelt tightly. Quick.

623
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,763
All right. Let's go.

624
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,848
Wait.

625
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,031
-Thank you!
-Yes, thank you.

626
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,993
LUNCH SERVICE OVER
OUT OF INGREDIENTS

627
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,538
Sir!

628
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,790
Two people.

629
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,708
You can't?

630
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,710
60 YEARS OF TRADITION
SOKCHO MAKGUKSU

631
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,045
We should have come a bit faster.

632
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,423
Then let's wait and come back for dinner.

633
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,757
No, that won't do.

634
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,051
Then our meal plans get all messed up.

635
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,761
Are we here to only eat food?

636
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,515
Yes. We're here to eat food
so we can come up with a new product.

637
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,142
That's true.

638
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,147
Fortunately, the grilled fish restaurant
takes reservations, so I made one.

639
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,316
But it's a bit far from here.

640
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,193
I'll look it up on the map.

641
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,414
Hello?

642
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,625
Hello, I've arrived at the beach.

643
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,668
You're there already?

644
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,462
That's good. We'll be on our way.

645
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,555
-Hey--
-The grilled fish restaurant

646
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,641
is about 40 minutes from here.

647
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,725
Is that okay?

648
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,811
It's not okay. Let's just eat
something simple nearby.

649
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,271
Nearby?

650
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,107
But there aren't
any good restaurants nearby.

651
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,984
Maybe there's something near the beach.

652
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,236
Near the beach?

653
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,574
Sir, I think all of the restaurants
are over there.

654
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,535
I wanted to see the ocean while I'm here.

655
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,663
We couldn't
because our schedule was so busy.

656
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,373
I see.

657
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,088
What?

658
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,256
THE HAMBURGER THAT WILL BECOME
THE SPECIALTY OF GANGWONDO

659
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,054
I know that truck.

660
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,599
That truck goes to Sokcho and Yangyang
based on the owner's whim.

661
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,060
So people say it's hard to eat there.

662
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,061
Is that so?

663
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,480
We must be lucky to have come across it.

664
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,898
Right?

665
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,029
Hello!

666
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,448
Hello. There you are.

667
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,581
Why did you come to sell burgers here?
This place is so remote.

668
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,542
Well, I had a feeling that

669
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,837
a handsome couple like you
would be right here, waiting for me.

670
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,879
So here I am.

671
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,758
We're not a couple.

672
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,093
What's the best one here?

673
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,262
They're all delicious.
You can choose here.

674
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,513
Just take a look.

675
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,724
It looks so good.

676
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,143
I want the egg… Just a second.

677
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,644
Grilled…

678
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,272
They're all good, right?
Which one should I get?

679
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:38,574
Here is our special gourmet burger
and blueberry ade.

680
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,410
Thank you.

681
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,829
I thought it was a prank call at first.

682
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,123
You said if I sold you
just two hamburgers,

683
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,167
you'd pay me an entire day's profit.

684
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,212
I wanted to do a special event.

685
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,468
She would be very touched
if you told her that you called me here.

686
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,720
It'd be tasteless

687
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,597
if I bragged about it.

688
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,606
Is the hamburger ready?

689
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,692
-Thank you.
-No, not at all.

690
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:18,447
Please have a wonderful
and meaningful day.

691
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,115
Thank you.

692
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,742
Shall we eat over there?

693
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:22,868
Sure.

694
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,168
Is it good?

695
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,629
Yes. I've fulfilled my wish.

696
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,925
I didn't know that
you liked hamburgers so much.

697
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,720
I didn't get to eat it a lot
when I was a kid.

698
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,430
Why not?

699
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,476
My family ran a bakery
when I was in elementary school.

700
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,604
My parents wouldn't buy me any hamburgers,

701
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,565
because people wouldn't buy our bread
if they saw me eat them.

702
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:57,403
So I went through a hard time trying
to eat them in secret.

703
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,824
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,701
I shared too much information.
You probably aren't interested.

705
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,619
No.

706
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,080
I'm very interested in you, Ms. Shin.

707
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,290
What?

708
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,503
It's my duty as the president
to be interested in my employees.

709
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:15,921
I see.

710
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,509
I saw that you majored
in Food and Culinary Arts.

711
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,178
When did you want to become a researcher?

712
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:26,890
When I was young

713
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,976
I didn't really have a dream.

714
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,770
Since I liked food so much,

715
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,731
I thought I should major in culinary arts
and become a chef.

716
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,777
Then I found out in college that there was
a job called a "Food Product Researcher."

717
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,447
So, as you can see, here I am.

718
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,867
So do you have a dream now?

719
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,369
Yes.

720
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:48,912
What is it?

721
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,878
It's a bit embarrassing.
Do I really have to say it here?

722
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,922
I'm asking you as your boss.
You should answer me as my employee.

723
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,592
What is this, a job interview?

724
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,679
Fine.

725
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:13,020
I always bought my food when I was young
because my parents were so busy.

726
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:19,067
So the frozen food made by big companies
was my favorite childhood food.

727
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,572
I want to let other people feel
the same happiness that I felt

728
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,617
when I ate that frozen food in the past.

729
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:31,497
Not everyone can afford to eat
at Michelin restaurants every day.

730
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:37,044
You said that you were developing
a kimchi product for the overseas market

731
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,505
and that you made several different
versions of it.

732
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,216
I really identified with you
as a researcher.

733
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,258
Is that so?

734
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,387
You must have thought
I didn't do any work.

735
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,140
No. That's not what I meant.

736
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,646
Damn. I really dug my own grave
with that one.

737
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,899
A lot of things happened that day,

738
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,401
but is that the only thing you remember?

739
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,778
No.

740
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,323
I went to a luxury brand shop

741
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,243
and such an expensive restaurant
for the first time in my life.

742
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,663
I could never forget. How could I?

743
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,629
It was like this that day too.

744
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,808
Whether you're Geum-hui or Ha-ri,

745
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,186
I guess this is the same.

746
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,825
It's so hard trying
to avoid him all the time.

747
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,662
It's not like I can move somewhere else.

748
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,914
Welcome.

749
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,667
Do you mind sitting over here?
That table is reserved.

750
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,426
Let's go home. I'm done eating.

751
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,887
Here's your seafood jjamppong. Enjoy.

752
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,183
Please eat. If I'm making you
uncomfortable, I'll leave.

753
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,187
No, take a seat. There's no need for that.

754
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,898
Right, it's not like
I committed a crime or anything.

755
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,245
Okay!

756
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,289
-All right!
-Wait, no.

757
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:41,126
I'll drive from now on.
You can ride in the passenger's seat.

758
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,545
No. I feel better if I'm driving.

759
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,632
But I don't like it.
Just rest in the passenger's seat.

760
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,385
Still, how can I let my boss drive--

761
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,764
When you were Shin Geum-hui,
you gladly sat in the passenger's seat.

762
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,558
Wasn't I your boss back then too?

763
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,686
Well, that's true, but…

764
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,896
Then just get in.

765
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,023
Okay.

766
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,823
Welcome.

767
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,079
This is going down smoothly.

768
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:21,917
What?

769
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,544
Why isn't it coming out?

770
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:29,132
Excuse me, one soju and one beer, please.

771
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,801
Sure thing. One moment.

772
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,410
I have a question.
Why are you avoiding me?

773
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,831
I have a question too.

774
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:05,043
Do you really not know the answer,
or are you acting like this on purpose?

775
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,378
Of course I don't know it.

776
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,421
I'm avoiding you

777
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,631
because I'm embarrassed.

778
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,467
I made such a scene

779
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,761
in front of a man I…

780
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,140
What kind of woman wouldn't avoid him?

781
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,350
Wait.

782
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,729
Why are you embarrassed by that?
It's a natural thing.

783
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,818
So stop avoiding me from now on, okay?

784
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:38,410
Yes, Mr. Kim.
Why are you calling on the weekend?

785
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,924
Where did the woman go?

786
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,885
She just left.

787
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,513
Jin Young-seo, you can't cross the line!

788
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,599
Don't cross the line! Snap out of it!

789
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,559
Come to your senses.

790
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,729
Why is he riding a scooter
on the sidewalk?

791
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,316
Are you hurt anywhere?

792
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,193
What?

793
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,569
Why are you here?

794
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,321
I followed you because I was worried.

795
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,617
Haven't you been rejecting me
this whole time?

796
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,119
Why are you being so nice to me?

797
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,122
If I'm being honest,

798
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,795
I fell for you the minute I laid eyes
on you at the convenience store.

799
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,298
But you were President Kang's secretary,

800
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:38,678
and you drew a line
and told me not to cross it.

801
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,224
And I can't even go to the bathroom
without being scared

802
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,517
because of that creep.

803
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:47,020
Not to mention making a fool of myself
in front of you.

804
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,772
Fine!

805
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,857
This is for the better.

806
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,693
I said I was going to stop liking you--

807
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,366
I told you to stop being nice to me.

808
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,036
Let go of me.

809
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,412
You'll fall if I let go.

810
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:09,376
Why do you care if I fall or not?

811
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,879
I'm going to count to three, so let go.

812
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,465
If you don't, I'm really…

813
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,177
going to cross the line.

814
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,973
One.

815
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,017
Two.

816
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,896
Three.

817
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,468
I think I had too many
hamburger and dumplings.

818
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,220
I'm still so full.

819
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,848
Thankfully, your clothes
didn't burst at the seams today.

820
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:08,059
No, those clothes were
too small back then.

821
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,314
I'm sorry. Those were expensive clothes.

822
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,525
I want to stop hearing apologies
from you, Ms. Shin.

823
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,027
What?

824
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,779
There are a lot of nice things to say
other than apologies.

825
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,657
Like how I'm cool,
or that it's fun to be with me.

826
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,581
You're funny.

827
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,668
Aren't you tired?
Get some sleep if you are.

828
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,421
I'm fine. You must be
even more tired since you're driving.

829
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,763
What?

830
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,973
It's raining.

831
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,767
Darn it, this is out of the blue.

832
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,811
I didn't think about the rain.

833
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,649
I didn't bring an umbrella.

834
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,737
Mom, Dad!

835
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,240
Dad!

836
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:17,379
Get out.

837
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:18,964
What?

838
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,718
I forgot that
I have an important meeting here today.

839
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,762
Go back to Seoul on your own.

840
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,517
Still, how could I go from here to--

841
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,227
Didn't you hear me?

842
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,148
Okay.

843
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,415
My bag!

844
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,417
President Kang, my bag!

845
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,252
My bag!

846
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,378
Darn it.

847
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,013
What in the world?

848
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:09,973
It's pouring.

849
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,110
What the hell is this?

850
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,369
Mom, Dad!

851
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,705
Dad!

852
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,999
-Don't look!
-Mom!

853
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,959
Dad!

854
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,127
Don't look.

855
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,004
Mom!

856
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,716
-Mom!
-My God, Tae-moo!

857
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,259
Dad!

858
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,399
How could he just leave me
on the side of the road when it's raining?

859
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,027
What an awful boss!

860
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,411
Don't die on me!

861
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,412
Darn it.

862
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,544
Damn it.

863
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,594
My heart fluttered
when he tied my shoelaces for me.

864
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,598
I must have been insane.

865
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,855
What's wrong with this thing?

866
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:40,582
The number you dialed is not available.
Please leave a message after the tone.

867
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,833
Where did she go?

868
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,256
Was this all part of his grand plan
to get his revenge on me?

869
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,510
Probably not.

870
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,929
I don't think he has the time for that.

871
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:01,769
Then why did he just abandon me
on the side of the road when it's raining.

872
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,771
I don't like rainy days.

873
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,191
Let's change the date instead.

874
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,199
I left a phone here a while ago
so it could be charged.

875
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,201
Over there.

876
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,160
Here you go.

877
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,119
Thank you.

878
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,497
Ha-ri!

879
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:23,791
What?

880
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,710
What are you guys doing here?

881
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,795
Weren't you going to Busan?

882
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,840
Min-woo's filming here instead.
Didn't you see my text?

883
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,926
What? No.

884
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,721
You also said that you have a date today.
Are you here with your boyfriend?

885
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,848
Well, that's--

886
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,267
Hey, no need to play shy between friends.

887
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,062
Since we've met like this,
let us see your rich boyfriend.

888
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,980
Yes, let us meet him, Ha-ri.

889
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,649
-Let us see him!
-Let us see him!

890
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,277
Actually, I didn't come
with my boyfriend--

891
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,195
Babe.

892
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,420
Did you wait long?

893
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,469
Ha-ri.

894
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,513
Who is this?

895
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,514
Oh, he's--

896
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,932
Nice to meet you.

897
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,434
I'm Ha-ri's boyfriend, Kang Tae-moo.

898
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,310
If we want to take your friends' ego
down a notch.

899
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,313
Do you know what my love for you
and this credit card have in common?

900
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,106
They both have no limit.

901
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,401
You're seriously out of your mind!

902
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,652
How did you two start dating?

903
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,530
I've never met anyone as crazy as Ha-ri.
It was refreshing.

904
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,033
Do you really not know
why I spent the entire weekend

905
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,035
pretending to be your boyfriend
when I hate wasting my time

906
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,578
more than anything?

907
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:27,707
