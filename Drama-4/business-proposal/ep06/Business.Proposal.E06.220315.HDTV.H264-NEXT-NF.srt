2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,334
Wait.

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,002
What?

4
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:09,796
What are you doing?

5
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:11,172
Let's go, Ms. Shin Ha-ri.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,510
What did you just call me?

7
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:19,764
I mean…

8
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,267
How did you…

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,685
I know

10
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,271
that you're Shin Ha-ri.

11
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:28,356
So let's just go

12
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:30,316
to the police station first.

13
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,113
<i>Shin Ha-ri, right?</i>

14
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:36,114
Yes.

15
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:37,574
When is she getting here?

16
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:39,993
She said that she was almost here.

17
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:41,327
Ha-ri!

18
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,539
I mean, Geum-hui.

19
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:51,796
Just come here.

20
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,175
What happened?

21
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:57,093
I don't know.

22
00:00:58,136 --> 00:01:02,599
Can you confirm
the footage you're about to see

23
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:03,767
is of yourselves?

24
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,352
<i>Still, isn't it pretty?</i>

25
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:08,521
<i>Yes, I guess so.</i>

26
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:10,440
Yes, that's us.

27
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,485
Unbelievable.

28
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:17,447
What?

29
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:21,367
Fortunately, there was
no more footage after this scene.

30
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:23,536
What a relief.

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,539
So? What's going to happen
to the bastard who took these videos?

32
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:27,749
He'll be arrested, right?

33
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:31,044
With something of this level,
he'll probably just be fined.

34
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:32,128
What?

35
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,296
How could that be?

36
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:35,965
He clearly approached me
to take secret videos of me.

37
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,217
He's only getting fined?

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,885
It upsets us too.

39
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:42,472
-But that is what the law currently says.
-But, still…

40
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,851
How can he only get a fine?

41
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:48,561
There they go.

42
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:50,313
Right? It makes no sense.

43
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:53,525
That man who installed the hidden camera…

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,443
Get me his personal information.

45
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,070
But why, sir?

46
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:06,621
I realized
that I don't know much about you.

47
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:08,081
My grandfather could ask about it.

48
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,709
Come to think of it, even since then…

49
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,464
balance the nutrition perfectly,
and make it commercially successful!

50
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:18,591
Again.

51
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:19,926
Again!

52
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,096
So he was already aware
that I was Shin Geum-hui…

53
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,101
and invited me to the Founding
Anniversary Ceremony on purpose?

54
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:33,231
No way.

55
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:34,983
<i>You're</i>

56
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,401
fired.

57
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:39,946
I don't work for you.

58
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,031
Who are you to tell me that I'm fired?

59
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:44,701
I am the president.

60
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:47,495
I found out
that you're an employee at UKay.

61
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,164
And I'll be buying the company out.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,543
On one condition.

63
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:56,379
They must fire Shin Jeong-u,
who illegally filmed two women.

64
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,715
Wait, what?

65
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:00,049
I saw that this isn't

66
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:02,468
the first time you've done this.

67
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:12,770
<i>What should I even say?</i>

68
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:16,399
<i>I'm also a victim of Shin Jeong-u.</i>

69
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:20,320
<i>He set up a hidden camera
and filmed me secretly.</i>

70
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:22,488
<i>I want him to pay for his crimes.</i>

71
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:28,536
There are a lot of victims
of your illegal filming.

72
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,497
I'll find every one of them
and file a lawsuit accordingly.

73
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,464
<i>On top of that, if your attempt
to destroy the evidence is added,</i>

74
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:42,550
you'll be serving time
in prison for a long time.

75
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:43,468
Wait.

76
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:45,803
How did you get…

77
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:49,349
You've managed to make it this far
without getting caught.

78
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,143
But unfortunately,

79
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:53,770
you ran into me.

80
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:57,357
And as you can see, I'm rich, persistent,

81
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:59,442
and smart.

82
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,155
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:07,325
Please forgive me just once. Have mercy.

84
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,578
I still have a lot of years to live.

85
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:12,163
I can't go to prison.

86
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:13,206
You have no shame.

87
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:18,044
Have you ever thought about your victims
who've been forced to live with the burden

88
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,213
of unknowingly being filmed?

89
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,846
After serving time, it'll be hard
for you to get a job anywhere.

90
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,599
Please have mercy. Please…

91
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:33,559
Hey!

92
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,231
Why are you doing all of this?
This has nothing to do with you!

93
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:45,738
You…

94
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:49,617
messed with someone
you should've never messed with.

95
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:53,997
You piece of trash.

96
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:58,209
Hey, Young-seo. Did you get to work okay?

97
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,378
No, I'm not worried.

98
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,838
I know how strong you are.

99
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:06,217
Make sure to call me
if you don't want to be alone at night.

100
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,011
-Son of a bitch.
-Bastard.

101
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:09,262
I feel much better now.

102
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,723
Yes. You seem pretty angry too, Mr. Cha.

103
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:12,640
What?

104
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,600
I think you're a lot more upset, sir.

105
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:15,560
What?

106
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,064
Well, who wouldn't be upset
in a situation like this?

107
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:21,941
-Indeed.
-Yes.

108
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,776
Ms. Shin!

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,069
Hello.

110
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:26,738
-Did you just get here?
-Yes.

111
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:29,741
It's President Kang.

112
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,660
His face is like a company perk.

113
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:35,246
I wonder who will end up
marrying a guy like that--

114
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:37,540
Ms. Shin?

115
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:38,624
Ms. Shin--

116
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:42,003
Hello.

117
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:52,805
Hello. I mean, goodbye.

118
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,894
-Go up first.
-What?

119
00:05:58,436 --> 00:05:59,479
Good morning.

120
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:00,396
Hello.

121
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,193
Is Ms. Shin not here yet?

122
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:06,486
Yes, she's not here yet.

123
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:07,945
-What?
-Why?

124
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:11,407
I saw Ms. Shin on the first floor earlier.

125
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:12,825
Then why isn't she here yet?

126
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,994
I thought she'd be here already.

127
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:18,372
Right. I asked her
for some data yesterday.

128
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:27,715
Damn it.

129
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,531
I can't live like this.
It's so nerve-racking.

130
00:06:57,328 --> 00:07:00,331
<i>Don't we have things to talk about?
Let's meet after work.</i>

131
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:07,004
What? What about Ms. Shin?

132
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:10,675
Didn't you hear me?
I've developed feelings for Ms. Shin.

133
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:13,094
No wonder.

134
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,221
How did this happen?

135
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,140
Not long ago, you were really angry…

136
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:22,270
and wanted to get back at her.
What's happened?

137
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:25,148
I think I've been attracted to her
ever since I first met her.

138
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:27,650
Seeing how I decided to marry her.

139
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,069
The woman you wanted to marry
was Shin Geum-hui.

140
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:32,905
How are they different?

141
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:33,948
Pardon?

142
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:37,493
Other than the fake backstory
and the lame disguise,

143
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:38,870
she was the real Shin Ha-ri.

144
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:42,290
I also like
that she's a dedicated researcher.

145
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,376
So what are you going to do now?

146
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,294
What do you mean?

147
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,337
I'll tell her.

148
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:49,297
What?

149
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:57,638
What do you think?
Do you think she'll like it?

150
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,765
Sir, aren't you taking things too fast?

151
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,226
To confess your feelings
without the proper buildup…

152
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,104
Who would possibly reject me
if I said I liked them?

153
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,023
I like how confident you are, but--

154
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,900
-I take this one.
-Yes, sir.

155
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,137
Ms. Shin, do you want
to start seeing each other

156
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:39,847
with marriage in mind?

157
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,434
I told you, I'm good at a lot of things.

158
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:47,605
Will this do?

159
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:48,940
Yes.

160
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:52,485
I'll signal by putting my fingers
up to my forehead like this. Thank you.

161
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:53,402
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:14,173
President Kang.

163
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:17,093
Please, sit.

164
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:36,279
Let's eat first.

165
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:39,198
No, I don't want to eat.

166
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:50,543
I am sincerely sorry
for lying to you this whole time.

167
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:54,463
From the very beginning,
I didn't approach you deliberately.

168
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:57,300
If I had known
that you'd be my blind date,

169
00:09:57,383 --> 00:09:58,509
I never would have gone.

170
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:02,555
And after that,
I got tangled up in that contract--

171
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:04,098
It's fine.

172
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:07,101
I didn't call you here
to hear you say that.

173
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:10,855
Now, what I was going to say is…

174
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:15,109
No. Hear me out first.

175
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,532
RESIGNATION LETTER

176
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,035
A resignation letter?

177
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,123
Are you handing in your resignation?

178
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:33,628
All the things you did to me
since you found out that I'm Shin Geum-hui

179
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,671
was to fire me, right?

180
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:39,592
Fine. I understand that you're mad.

181
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:43,721
But, even though I wronged you personally,

182
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:46,807
I did nothing wrong as an employee.

183
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:47,850
So…

184
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:50,936
please give me one more chance.

185
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:55,107
-A chance?
-Please listen to my presentation.

186
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:58,736
After that, you can decide if you want
to accept my resignation or not.

187
00:10:58,819 --> 00:10:59,737
A presentation?

188
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:10,498
I have compiled all of the contributions
that I've made for the company.

189
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:12,625
You have two choices.

190
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,045
First, you could fire me,
a competent employee, for personal reasons

191
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:18,589
and then regret it for a long time.

192
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,174
Or, as a second option,

193
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:24,345
you could take advantage of my abilities
and have me work really hard

194
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,930
until the day I retire.

195
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,351
This isn't why I called you here.

196
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:33,187
What?

197
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:40,236
This is the <i>bindaetteok</i> that I came up
with right after I started working.

198
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,905
It was praised for its traditional taste.

199
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:46,617
And this is the Bucket List Sandwich,
which I also proposed.

200
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,119
Or the K-Pop Sandwich.

201
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:52,456
And this is the Bucket List Fish
that's top-ranked in the market.

202
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,792
It was also produced by me.

203
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,421
As you can see, I am an excellent employee
who helped produce so many products,

204
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:01,674
and the youngest employee
to ever receive the Mega Hit Award.

205
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,094
Will you really cast me aside

206
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:07,721
because you want to get back at me?

207
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,330
What? A presentation?
free at kisskh.me

208
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,169
Stop it.

209
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:40,629
So what did you tell her?

210
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:41,630
What do you think?

211
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,008
I said that I would think about it.

212
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,385
How can she

213
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,013
not see me in a romantic light?

214
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:52,016
I'm handsome, tall, and rich.
What do I not have?

215
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,058
There's one thing.

216
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:58,397
That heart-pounding charm.

217
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:02,151
Ms. Shin's heart is currently beating
for another man.

218
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:06,697
She said that one-sided crush was over.

219
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,284
But it takes time to open up
your heart to somebody else.

220
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,370
Besides, the setup of the relationship
between you and Ms. Shin

221
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:15,331
is basically the worst.

222
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:16,957
What? How--

223
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:22,129
Because, to Ms. Shin, you're simply
a terrifying boss who tried to fire her.

224
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:23,881
I don't think it was that bad.

225
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:27,968
I mean, we did have some romantic moments.

226
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,930
That was when you were
on fake dates during a fake relationship.

227
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:36,310
From now on,
you need to make real situations.

228
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:38,604
Real situations?

229
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:49,824
Why isn't he reaching out to me?

230
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:52,701
Damn it.

231
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:56,163
Should I have begged him to not fire me?

232
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,167
President Kang?

233
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:03,546
INCOMING CALL
YOO-RA

234
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:05,923
Why is she calling me all of a sudden?

235
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:07,591
Congratulations.

236
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,885
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

237
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:11,095
Congratulations.

238

LIMITED TIME SPECIAL OFFER
GET A NEW PHONE NOW

239
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:21,981
Going on television
and having a product released.

240
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,440
One meal will never cut it.

241
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:26,527
Yeong-jun, why are you
making a big deal out of it?

242
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,821
This is all thanks to Ha-ri
who recommended him.

243
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,573
He should be treating her, if anybody.

244
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:33,659
No, it's all because Min-woo
did everything so well.

245
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,287
I do owe you. You got me this TV spot

246
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,957
to make me more recognizable
since I'm the least popular chef.

247
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,045
Still, like Ha-ri said, you wouldn't
have made it if you weren't good.

248
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,839
Anyway, thank you, Ha-ri.

249
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,260
I'll go get some more snacks.

250
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,013
I'm going to get another bottle of wine.

251
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,476
Those two are impressive.

252
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,645
How many times have they broken up?

253
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:05,065
I don't get Yoo-ra, who wanted to
get back together after breaking up,

254
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,942
or Min-woo, who accepted her back.

255
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:07,902
Stop it.

256
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:11,530
Honestly, I thought that
Min-woo would end up dating Ha-ri.

257
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:13,949
Me too. Weren't you two a thing?

258
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,534
What?

259
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:16,744
No!

260
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:19,580
"A thing"?
Stop saying stupid things like that.

261
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,541
Watch your mouth, okay?

262
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,128
What are you guys talking about?

263
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,339
Nothing, we didn't talk about much.

264
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:31,884
By the way,
are you two doing anything this weekend?

265
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,178
-Do you want to go on a trip together?
-A trip?

266
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:39,016
Oh, Min-woo's TV program
is filming in Busan.

267
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:41,727
Da-hye, Ji-min and I
are going to go with him.

268
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:45,356
I'm really sorry,
but I'm busy this weekend.

269
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,650
You have something too, right?

270
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,902
-What? Me?
-Yes.

271
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,279
Oh, yes, right.

272
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:55,324
By the way, Ha-ri,
you've been staring at your phone.

273
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,952
-Did you get a boyfriend?
-What?

274
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:00,454
Of course, Ha-ri doesn't have a boyfriend.

275
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:03,832
Ha-ri, your standards are too high.
Maybe you should lower them.

276
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:04,833
-Right.
-Guys!

277
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:09,046
Ha-ri does have a boyfriend.

278
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:10,714
-Really?
-What?

279
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:12,299
What are you doing? Sit down.

280
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:17,346
He's super handsome,
really nice to Ha-ri, very tall,

281
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,266
and he comes from a really rich family.

282
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,895
You're going on a date
with him this weekend too, right?

283
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,313
-I did?
-Yes.

284
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,024
Hey, Min-woo.

285
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:32,319
They say Ha-ri has a boyfriend.
Did you know?

286
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:37,408
Are you dating the guy
that you went to the concert with?

287
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,034
What?

288
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:40,911
Yes.

289
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,330
-You went to a concert together?
-What? With who?

290
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:45,165
Really? Hey, show us a picture!

291
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:46,917
Let's see a picture.

292
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,127
Later.

293
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,381
Yes, guys, later.
He's better-looking in person.

294
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,384
Do you guys not believe me?

295
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:58,387
I can't believe you.
Why would you lie like that back there?

296
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,222
I was just annoyed by Yoo-ra.

297
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:04,727
Where's the guy that I'm seeing
who's very tall, handsome, and rich?

298
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,020
I want to see him too.

299
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:07,730
You know who I'm talking about.

300
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:10,149
-Kang Tae-moo. Although it's fake.
-What?

301
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:13,193
I'm just saying, I wish you would
just date Kang Tae-moo

302
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:15,112
and crush Yoo-ra, that's all.

303
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,281
What are you talking about?

304
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:21,326
I'm about to get fired by Kang Tae-moo.

305
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:26,915
Don't worry. Even if you get fired,
I'll beg my father to help you get a job.

306
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:29,877
Did I drink too much wine?
My stomach hurts.

307
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,503
I'm going to the bathroom.

308
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:32,588
It hurts.

309
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:40,429
Jeez.

310
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,652
I'm just going to go once I'm back home.

311
00:17:57,613 --> 00:17:58,989
Damn it.

312
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:01,075
<i>Come see me in my office.</i>

313
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:30,979
Did you not sleep well?

314
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:31,939
What?

315
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,484
Yes, I guess.

316
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,611
You were so confident before,

317
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,405
but I guess you were worried
you'd get fired.

318
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:45,327
I'll be fine with whatever decision
you've made, sir.

319
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:50,833
That's a good stance.

320
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,505
RESIGNATION LETTER

321
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,856
Like you said, it would be my loss
to fire a useful employee like you

322
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,274
because of a personal reason.

323
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:19,486
Thank you, thank you so much!

324
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,323
I will work as hard as I can. Thank you!

325
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:24,449
See you after work.

326
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:27,995
I've been working on a project
for a new product in secret.

327
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:29,288
After work?

328
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:31,832
Is that a problem?

329
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,335
What happened to that employee
who just told me she would work

330
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:36,920
as hard as she can?

331
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:39,089
No. She's right here.

332
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:41,758
Then I'll see you later. Thank you, sir.

333
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,783
Why does he want to see me after work?

334
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:10,662
Well, that doesn't matter.

335
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:12,289
I didn't get fired!

336
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,923
This one's better, right?

337
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:23,717
Okay, so we're done with this product.

338
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,761
Let's start on the next product
after a break.

339
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:27,930
-Okay.
-I'm going to the bathroom real quick.

340
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:29,139
Sure.

341
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:32,017
By the way,
don't you hate the bathroom here?

342
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,811
Right? It's a unisex bathroom.
It makes me uncomfortable.

343
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:38,065
<i>I shouldn't drink this
if I don't want to go to the bathroom.</i>

344
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,654
Hi, babies!

345
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:46,448
Everyone, please have some coffee.

346
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:49,284
This is from a super expensive
and famous shop.

347
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:02,506
Oh, my god!

348
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:05,050
Hello, how are you?

349
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:11,348
Oh, my god!

350
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:16,979
Yes, that sounds great.

351
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:20,482
Oh, my god!

352
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:29,199
Oh, my god!

353
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:30,575
Oh, my god!

354
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:37,582
Oh, my god!

355
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,298
Ms. Jin. I can't believe it.

356
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:47,259
Why do you keep getting
the same clothes as me?

357
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:50,262
I think you're the one
who's doing that actually.

358
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,514
Stupid! That makes no sense.

359
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:56,101
I'm sure that the employee said
that this was the last one.

360
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,645
-Is that really what they said?
-Yes.

361
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,147
Oh, my.

362
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,276
When I went to buy it, the employee
said that there were just two pieces left.

363
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:09,031
So I bought it before you, right?

364
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:22,878
What kind of new product is it that
you wanted to see me at a movie theater?

365
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,213
I don't have a detailed plan yet,

366
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:27,299
so I asked to see you here
to clear my head.

367
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:30,302
Then shouldn't we discuss
the new product first?

368
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:33,555
Do you think I asked to see you
at a theater just to clear my head?

369
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:37,267
The main character in this movie
is a researcher at a food company.

370
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:40,353
I'm preparing to localize
our products in the US,

371
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:42,773
so won't it be helpful
to see what researchers do

372
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:44,024
in the United States?

373
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,071
I see. So you're saying that

374
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:52,574
since I can't go abroad in person,

375
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:56,286
it would be helpful to indirectly
experience it through a movie, right?

376
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,996
That's right.

377
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,832
Sure, I think it'll be helpful.

378
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:05,087
I only saw places like these on TV shows.

379
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:07,839
What do you want to eat?

380
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,430
They all look good.

381
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:16,890
Then let's order all of them.

382
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,940
By the way, there's nobody here.

383
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:27,109
Of course. I rented the entire place.

384
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:30,070
What? The entire place? Why?

385
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:33,240
I've always hated crowded places.

386
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:35,826
Unbelievable.

387
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,416
Want a glass of wine?

388
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:49,923
My chair isn't working.

389
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:54,177
Let me see.

390
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,110
Wait.

391
00:24:10,944 --> 00:24:12,154
I'm going to the bathroom.

392
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:21,872
Gosh, my heart skips a beat
at the smallest things.

393
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:28,420
You haven't dated in a long time.
Shin Ha-ri.

394
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:33,175
Far too long.

395
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:35,552
Sure.

396
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:37,387
Ms. Shin?

397
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,807
What are you two doing here?

398
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:44,436
What do you mean? We're here
to watch a movie at the movie theater.

399
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,231
Mr. Gye kept telling me that
he had a VIP ticket or something.

400
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:52,444
-I see.
-Turns out that ticket was for today.

401
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:54,446
It would've been a waste to throw it away.

402
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,033
but the easiest person
who I could think of calling was Ms. Yeo.

403
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:00,327
So I let her come with me. Yes.

404
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,578
That's what happened.

405
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:03,038
Okay.

406
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:03,955
"The easiest"?

407
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,374
I came here because you begged me.
Should I just go?

408
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,211
Hey, don't be like that.
You're already here.

409
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,547
Are you here by yourself?

410
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,967
Yes.

411
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:19,262
It's not like
I have a boyfriend or anything.

412
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:21,932
Movies are best watched alone, right?

413
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:24,643
I'll go to watch the movie, then.

414
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:27,229
I'll see you at work tomorrow. Bye.

415
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:30,815
Shall we go in too?

416
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:36,154
President Kang.

417
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:46,539
Did she go over there?

418
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:50,001
That's the pricey theater.
Why would she go over there alone?

419
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:51,336
Did she go over here?

420
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:53,797
President Kang. We have a big problem.

421
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,840
-What?
-We have to be careful when we leave.

422
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:59,261
-I just met Ms. Yeo and--
-Ms. Shin?

423
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:03,056
Why, Ms. Yeo?

424
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:08,895
Why are you here?

425
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:09,813
Gosh.

426
00:26:13,108 --> 00:26:14,150
Look at this.

427
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:21,408
This place is awesome.

428
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:22,701
Right?

429
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:25,203
Are you waiting for somebody?

430
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,788
No.

431
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:31,042
I booked two seats so I could watch
the movie comfortably by myself.

432
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:34,421
Flex, right.

433
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:39,592
Flexing like this sometimes
is really good for de-stressing.

434
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:51,521
Gosh, this is--

435
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:54,065
I think the movie
is supposed to start soon.

436
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:55,358
You two should go.

437
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:58,945
This is so much food for just one person!

438
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,157
How about we join you?

439
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,533
No! That's not--

440
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:04,868
-Let's go.
-It's starting.

441
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:06,036
I, that's, no--

442
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,787
Come on, where's your conscience?

443
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:09,372
You can go watch it by yourself.

444
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:10,373
Darn it.

445
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:15,086
-It's starting.
-Right.

446
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:20,008
-It reclines.
-Really?

447
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:23,887
The popcorn's delicious.

448
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,287
Thank you for your hard work.

449
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:59,297
I've been out on business all day,
so I couldn't go to the bathroom.

450
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,759
What am I doing?

451
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,012
I really need to go.

452
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,765
When is the bus coming?

453
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:14,145
Save me, God.

454
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:26,032
What?

455
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,203
Thank you for helping me catch the guy
who had secretly filmed me.

456
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:32,414
I didn't even get to thank you properly.

457
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:33,331
It's fine.

458
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:35,583
I did what anybody would have done.

459
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:42,757
Are you all right?

460
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:44,175
What?

461
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:48,179
Of course. It wasn't a big deal.

462
00:28:57,564 --> 00:28:59,399
It should be over by now.

463
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:13,955
They said that it will awaken
the desire to be in a relationship.

464
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:16,166
What a lie. Don't you think so?

465
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,462
-Are you crying?
-But the female lead died.

466
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:25,759
And she even had the same name
as my younger sister who passed away.

467
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:28,636
Sujeong.

468
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,850
Mr. Gye must have
a younger sister who died.

469
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:37,479
Younger sister, my foot.
He used to have a dog named Sujeong.

470
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,606
Poor Sujeong.

471
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,318
I didn't even get to be with her
when she passed.

472
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,403
I'm so sorry!

473
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:49,282
If a dog lived to be 20 years old
and even had a great-grandson,

474
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:50,992
it had a much better life than you.

475
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:52,368
Who's pitying who now?

476
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:55,705
Why haven't they parted ways yet?

477
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:02,295
Unbelievable.

478
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:08,468
Yes, sir.

479
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:11,137
Is the movie over?

480
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:16,559
Yes. But Mr. Gye wanted to
have a drink, so I'm on my way there.

481
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:17,894
<i>Did you go back home?</i>

482
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:20,480
Of course.

483
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:24,067
Did you think that I'd be waiting for you?

484
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,401
Here? With nothing to do?

485
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:27,987
What are you doing, Ms. Shin? Let's go.

486
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:29,781
Coming.

487
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:34,285
I'll let you know about the report
once I've submitted it. Bye.

488
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,336
A report?

489
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:46,965
The traffic's pretty bad.

490
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:53,388
-Are you hot?
-What?

491
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:55,723
Yes, a bit.

492
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:58,268
Could I open the window?

493
00:30:58,351 --> 00:30:59,310
Sure.

494
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,737
<i>You need to hold it in, Young-seo.</i>

495
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:12,782
<i>Think about something
other than the bathroom.</i>

496
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:16,411
<i>Today is Monday, right?
So tomorrow starts with a T, toilet day--</i>

497
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:18,121
<i>What? No.</i>

498
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:19,497
<i>Think about something else.</i>

499
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:22,208
Excuse me.

500
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:25,378
Could you turn on some music?

501
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:26,713
Music?

502
00:31:29,215 --> 00:31:31,676
<i>This is my delight</i>

503
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,762
<i>Thus to wait and watch at the wayside</i>

504
00:31:36,264 --> 00:31:37,432
<i>Where shadow chases light</i>

505
00:31:37,515 --> 00:31:39,893
<i>And the rain comes
In the wake of the summer</i>

506
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:41,311
I'm getting off here!

507
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:43,396
What? Here?

508
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,355
Yes.

509
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:46,316
I think I need to get off.

510
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,693
Why would you get off
in the middle of the road--

511
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:51,029
What I'm saying is…

512
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:53,573
Are you all right?

513
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:57,076
If I stay in here any longer…

514
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:02,081
I'll probably relieve myself in the car.

515
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:03,958
What?

516
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:06,377
Goodbye, then.

517
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:11,215
Wait. Ms. Jin!

518
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:20,475
Bathroom.

519
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:23,686
Jin Young-seo, hold it.
You can hold it. You can do it.

520
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:28,441
I'm going to die of embarrassment.

521
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:31,778
Bathroom!

522
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:34,113
Now I'm feeling a number two too.

523
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:36,532
I'm going crazy!

524
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:40,870
What?

525
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,581
Dear God, dear Buddha.

526
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,667
What have I done that was so horrible?

527
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:50,797
Why did you chase me all the way here?

528
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,466
I was worried.
Why haven't you gone inside yet?

529
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:54,509
The door is locked.

530
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:58,096
Go away, quick.
I really could do it right here.

531
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,514
Hold on.

532
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:09,357
What?

533
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,442
-Get in. Quickly.
-Wait, slowly.

534
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:17,407
Mr. Cha, you should go first!

535
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:54,193
Why is it so hard to go on just one date?

536
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:02,410
What excuse should I use
to call her next time?

537
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:15,214
SHIN HA-RI

538
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:17,467
Why are there so many people
with the same name?

539
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:28,686
The plan for the second half
of this year is the following.

540
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,775
Expand the size of our online platform
to 300 percent of what it is currently.

541
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:37,904
We expect the profits of this to be
about 80 billion won.

542
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:40,865
After discussing this through a meeting
with the consulting firm…

543
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:42,492
She was cute when she was young too.

544
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,118
Our online platform is not easy to use

545
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:47,455
when compared to the rest of the market
and other companies' systems.

546
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:50,625
Also, according to our customers,

547
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,294
we don't have
detailed descriptions of our products

548
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:55,922
and many other inconvenient aspects.

549
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,924
This is an area we need to fix.

550
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:00,968
Ms. Shin. We're going on
a business trip together.

551
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:02,595
Be prepared.

552
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:10,144
GANGWONDO

553
00:35:10,228 --> 00:35:12,438
One, two, three.

554
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:14,690
Congratulations.

555
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:17,026
Congratulations, sir.

556
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,321
Lastly, this is the grand ballroom.

557
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:22,198
Gosh, it looks incredible.

558
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:26,202
Chairman Kang, thank you for coming
and staying with me until the end.

559
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:27,662
No problem.

560
00:35:27,745 --> 00:35:30,706
You probably have a lot of guests.
I should let you go.

561
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,584
-I hope you have a pleasant time, then.
-Yes, thank you.

562
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:34,752
Let's go.

563
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:40,591
-Sung-hoon.
-Yes, sir.

564
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:43,094
-Do I have anything else for today?
-No, sir.

565
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:46,639
It's been a while
since we've come all the way to Sokcho.

566
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:48,724
Let's go fishing by the ocean.

567
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:51,727
Go fishing with Sung-hoon.
I have another engagement today.

568
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:52,770
What?

569
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:54,689
Why do you always--

570
00:35:57,608 --> 00:35:58,442
Really?

571
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:02,071
Okay, then take care of your business,

572
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:04,073
and I'll see you in Seoul, okay?

573
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:07,618
Just stay the night over, okay?

574
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:08,995
Come back tomorrow.

575
00:36:09,078 --> 00:36:10,788
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

576
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:11,747
All right, then.

577
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:12,832
Yes.

578
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,501
I'll see you in Seoul, sir.

579
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:18,880
Hey, Sung-hoon. Come over here.

580
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:20,756
Hey.

581
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:27,346
Tae-moo's "engagement" is
taking Ms. Shin Geum-hui on a date, right?

582
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:30,725
-What?
-Tell him to go on a lot of dates.

583
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:36,105
It would be even better
if they come back with a great-grandson.

584
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,735
Hey, let's go. Let's go fishing.

585
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:41,819
Come on, let's go.

586
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:46,574
When he finds out that Shin Geum-hui
is actually Shin Ha-ri--

587
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:55,166
I can't believe that
I'm going on a business trip…

588
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,127
on my precious weekend.

589
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:00,588
I brought this on myself.

590
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,132
Ha-ri, you idiot.

591
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:06,177
<i>We're on our way.</i>

592
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,930
<i>Ha-ri and Young-seo,
I wish that you guys could come, too.</i>

593
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:12,767
<i>Ha-ri said she has a date with
her boyfriend.</i>

594
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,352
<i>Have fun on your date.</i>

595
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:17,438
<i>Thanks. Have fun on your trip.</i>

596
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:26,155
Yes, sir. I just got here. Where are you?

597
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,406
I see you.

598
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,824
You can see me?

599
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,344
Gosh. He looks so cool.

600
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,268
You're here for work.
Come to your senses, Ha-ri.

601
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:04,777
Why did you ask me to come to Sokcho?

602
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,156
Did you get an idea for that new product?

603
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:12,952
Sokcho has a lot of good dishes,

604
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:15,454
so I thought
that I might get an idea as I'm eating.

605
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:19,000
I actually did a lot of research
on the famous restaurants in Sokcho.

606
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:24,255
Let's go to the one that I found first.

607
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:25,715
Sure.

608
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:28,217
Give me your bag and wait in the car.

609
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:29,635
No. It's all right.

610
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:42,606
Also, according to our customers,

611
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,985
we don't have
detailed descriptions of our products

612
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:47,862
and many other inconvenient aspects.

613
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:49,655
This is an area we need to fix.

614
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:50,698
I WANT TO VISIT SOKCHO
AND HAVE DELICIOUS FOOD

615
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:00,833
What are you doing?

616
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,877
I can drive.

617
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,256
-But I should drive--
-No. I can't let you drive, sir.

618
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,467
I'm a great driver. Don't worry.

619
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,426
Let's go!

620
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:27,610
Where shall I take you, Mr. Kang?

621
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:32,740
SOKCHO <i>MAKGUKSU</i>

622
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:34,658
<i>Looking for the route</i>

623
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:36,410
-I really wanted to go here.
-<i>…with the least travel time.</i>

624
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:37,953
-Is that so?
-Yes.

625
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:41,165
Then why don't we take our time
and go on a drive along the sea?

626
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:42,750
Go on a drive?

627
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,919
We don't have the time for that, sir.

628
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:46,379
-Seatbelt.
-What?

629
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:48,214
Put on your seatbelt tightly. Quick.

630
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:50,716
All right. Let's go.

631
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,801
Wait.

632
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,984
-Thank you!
-Yes, thank you.

633
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:11,946
LUNCH SERVICE OVER
OUT OF INGREDIENTS

634
00:40:14,657 --> 00:40:15,491
Sir!

635
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,743
Two people.

636
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:18,661
You can't?

637
00:40:18,744 --> 00:40:20,663
60 YEARS OF TRADITION
SOKCHO <i>MAKGUKSU</i>

638
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:22,998
We should have come a bit faster.

639
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:25,376
Then let's wait and come back for dinner.

640
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:26,710
No, that won't do.

641
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,004
Then our meal plans get all messed up.

642
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:30,714
Are we here to only eat food?

643
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:34,468
Yes. We're here to eat food
so we can come up with a new product.

644
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:36,095
That's true.

645
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:41,100
Fortunately, the grilled fish restaurant
takes reservations, so I made one.

646
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:43,269
But it's a bit far from here.

647
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:45,146
I'll look it up on the map.

648
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:58,367
Hello?

649
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:00,578
<i>Hello, I've arrived at the beach.</i>

650
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:02,621
You're there already?

651
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:04,415
That's good. We'll be on our way.

652
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:14,508
-Hey--
-The grilled fish restaurant

653
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:16,594
is about 40 minutes from here.

654
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:17,678
Is that okay?

655
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:20,764
It's not okay. Let's just eat
something simple nearby.

656
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,224
Nearby?

657
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:25,060
But there aren't
any good restaurants nearby.

658
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:26,937
Maybe there's something near the beach.

659
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:28,189
Near the beach?

660
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:33,527
Sir, I think all of the restaurants
are over there.

661
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:35,488
I wanted to see the ocean while I'm here.

662
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,616
We couldn't
because our schedule was so busy.

663
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:40,326
I see.

664
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:47,041
What?

665
00:41:47,124 --> 00:41:48,209
THE HAMBURGER THAT WILL BECOME
THE SPECIALTY OF GANGWONDO

666
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:55,007
I know that truck.

667
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,552
That truck goes to Sokcho and Yangyang
based on the owner's whim.

668
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:01,013
So people say it's hard to eat there.

669
00:42:01,096 --> 00:42:02,014
Is that so?

670
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,433
We must be lucky to have come across it.

671
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:05,851
Right?

672
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:11,982
Hello!

673
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:14,401
Hello. There you are.

674
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:21,534
Why did you come to sell burgers here?
This place is so remote.

675
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:24,495
Well, I had a feeling that

676
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:27,790
a handsome couple like you
would be right here, waiting for me.

677
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:28,832
So here I am.

678
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,711
We're not a couple.

679
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:34,046
What's the best one here?

680
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:36,215
They're all delicious.
You can choose here.

681
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:37,466
Just take a look.

682
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:39,677
It looks so good.

683
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,096
I want the egg… Just a second.

684
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:43,597
Grilled…

685
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:46,225
They're all good, right?
Which one should I get?

686
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:56,527
Here is our special gourmet burger
and blueberry ade.

687
00:42:58,529 --> 00:42:59,363
Thank you.

688
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:01,782
I thought it was a prank call at first.

689
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,076
You said if I sold you
just two hamburgers,

690
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,120
you'd pay me an entire day's profit.

691
00:43:08,747 --> 00:43:10,165
I wanted to do a special event.

692
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:15,421
She would be very touched
if you told her that you called me here.

693
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,673
It'd be tasteless

694
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:19,550
if I bragged about it.

695
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:28,559
Is the hamburger ready?

696
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,645
-Thank you.
-No, not at all.

697
00:43:31,729 --> 00:43:36,400
Please have a wonderful
and meaningful day.

698
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:38,068
Thank you.

699
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:39,695
Shall we eat over there?

700
00:43:39,778 --> 00:43:40,821
Sure.

701
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,121
Is it good?

702
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:51,582
Yes. I've fulfilled my wish.

703
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:55,878
I didn't know that
you liked hamburgers so much.

704
00:43:57,296 --> 00:43:59,673
I didn't get to eat it a lot
when I was a kid.

705
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:01,383
Why not?

706
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:05,429
My family ran a bakery
when I was in elementary school.

707
00:44:06,263 --> 00:44:08,557
My parents wouldn't buy me any hamburgers,

708
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:11,518
because people wouldn't buy our bread
if they saw me eat them.

709
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:15,356
So I went through a hard time trying
to eat them in secret.

710
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,777
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,654
I shared too much information.
You probably aren't interested.

712
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:23,572
No.

713
00:44:24,323 --> 00:44:26,033
I'm very interested in you, Ms. Shin.

714
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:28,243
What?

715
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,456
It's my duty as the president
to be interested in my employees.

716
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,874
I see.

717
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:38,462
I saw that you majored
in Food and Culinary Arts.

718
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:41,131
When did you want to become a researcher?

719
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:44,843
When I was young

720
00:44:45,594 --> 00:44:46,929
I didn't really have a dream.

721
00:44:48,013 --> 00:44:49,723
Since I liked food so much,

722
00:44:49,807 --> 00:44:52,684
I thought I should major in culinary arts
and become a chef.

723
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:56,730
Then I found out in college that there was
a job called a "Food Product Researcher."

724
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:59,400
So, as you can see, here I am.

725
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:02,820
So do you have a dream now?

726
00:45:04,488 --> 00:45:05,322
Yes.

727
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:06,865
What is it?

728
00:45:10,035 --> 00:45:13,831
It's a bit embarrassing.
Do I really have to say it here?

729
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:16,875
I'm asking you as your boss.
You should answer me as my employee.

730
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:19,545
What is this, a job interview?

731
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:23,632
Fine.

732
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:30,973
I always bought my food when I was young
because my parents were so busy.

733
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:37,020
So the frozen food made by big companies
was my favorite childhood food.

734
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:41,525
I want to let other people feel
the same happiness that I felt

735
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:44,570
when I ate that frozen food in the past.

736
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:49,450
Not everyone can afford to eat
at Michelin restaurants every day.

737
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,997
You said that you were developing
a kimchi product for the overseas market

738
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,458
and that you made several different
versions of it.

739
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,169
I really identified with you
as a researcher.

740
00:46:00,252 --> 00:46:01,211
Is that so?

741
00:46:02,588 --> 00:46:05,340
You must have thought
I didn't do any work.

742
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:08,093
No. That's not what I meant.

743
00:46:10,846 --> 00:46:13,599
Damn. I really dug my own grave
with that one.

744
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:16,852
A lot of things happened that day,

745
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:19,354
but is that the only thing you remember?

746
00:46:19,438 --> 00:46:20,731
No.

747
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:24,276
I went to a luxury brand shop

748
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:27,196
and such an expensive restaurant
for the first time in my life.

749
00:46:28,113 --> 00:46:30,616
I could never forget. How could I?

750
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:38,582
It was like this that day too.

751
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:50,761
Whether you're Geum-hui or Ha-ri,

752
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,139
I guess this is the same.

753
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:07,778
It's so hard trying
to avoid him all the time.

754
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,615
It's not like I can move somewhere else.

755
00:47:12,908 --> 00:47:13,867
Welcome.

756
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:16,620
Do you mind sitting over here?
That table is reserved.

757
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:25,379
Let's go home. I'm done eating.

758
00:47:25,462 --> 00:47:28,840
Here's your seafood <i>jjamppong</i>. Enjoy.

759
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:33,136
Please eat. If I'm making you
uncomfortable, I'll leave.

760
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,140
No, take a seat. There's no need for that.

761
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:39,851
<i>Right, it's not like
I committed a crime or anything.</i>

762
00:47:51,947 --> 00:47:53,198
Okay!

763
00:47:53,991 --> 00:47:55,242
-All right!
-Wait, no.

764
00:47:55,325 --> 00:47:59,079
I'll drive from now on.
You can ride in the passenger's seat.

765
00:47:59,162 --> 00:48:01,498
No. I feel better if I'm driving.

766
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:04,585
But I don't like it.
Just rest in the passenger's seat.

767
00:48:05,877 --> 00:48:08,338
Still, how can I let my boss drive--

768
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:11,717
When you were Shin Geum-hui,
you gladly sat in the passenger's seat.

769
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,511
Wasn't I your boss back then too?

770
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:17,639
Well, that's true, but…

771
00:48:17,723 --> 00:48:18,849
Then just get in.

772
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,976
Okay.

773
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,776
Welcome.

774
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:35,032
This is going down smoothly.

775
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:39,870
What?

776
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:42,497
Why isn't it coming out?

777
00:48:43,832 --> 00:48:47,085
Excuse me, one soju and one beer, please.

778
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:48,754
Sure thing. One moment.

779
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:14,363
I have a question.
Why are you avoiding me?

780
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,784
I have a question too.

781
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:22,996
Do you really not know the answer,
or are you acting like this on purpose?

782
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,331
Of course I don't know it.

783
00:49:24,414 --> 00:49:25,374
I'm avoiding you

784
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,584
because I'm embarrassed.

785
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:30,420
I made such a scene

786
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,714
in front of a man I…

787
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:36,093
What kind of woman wouldn't avoid him?

788
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:38,303
Wait.

789
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:41,682
Why are you embarrassed by that?
It's a natural thing.

790
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:44,393
Oh, my gosh!

791
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:47,771
So stop avoiding me from now on, okay?

792
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,363
Yes, Mr. Kim.
Why are you calling on the weekend?

793
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:10,877
Where did the woman go?

794
00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:12,838
She just left.

795
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,466
Jin Young-seo, you can't cross the line!

796
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,552
Don't cross the line! Snap out of it!

797
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:20,512
Come to your senses.

798
00:50:21,763 --> 00:50:23,682
Why is he riding a scooter
on the sidewalk?

799
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:27,269
Are you hurt anywhere?

800
00:50:27,936 --> 00:50:29,146
What?

801
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:30,522
Why are you here?

802
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:32,274
I followed you because I was worried.

803
00:50:33,608 --> 00:50:36,570
Haven't you been rejecting me
this whole time?

804
00:50:36,653 --> 00:50:39,072
Why are you being so nice to me?

805
00:50:40,866 --> 00:50:42,075
If I'm being honest,

806
00:50:42,993 --> 00:50:47,748
I fell for you the minute I laid eyes
on you at the convenience store.

807
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:51,251
But you were President Kang's secretary,

808
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:56,631
and you drew a line
and told me not to cross it.

809
00:50:57,257 --> 00:51:00,177
And I can't even go to the bathroom
without being scared

810
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,470
because of that creep.

811
00:51:02,095 --> 00:51:04,973
Not to mention making a fool of myself
in front of you.

812
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:06,725
Fine!

813
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:08,810
This is for the better.

814
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:11,646
I said I was going to stop liking you--

815
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:17,319
I told you to stop being nice to me.

816
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,989
Let go of me.

817
00:51:21,072 --> 00:51:22,365
You'll fall if I let go.

818
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:27,329
Why do you care if I fall or not?

819
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:30,832
I'm going to count to three, so let go.

820
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,418
If you don't, I'm really…

821
00:51:35,337 --> 00:51:37,130
going to cross the line.

822
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,926
One.

823
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:43,970
Two.

824
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:47,849
Three.

825
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,501
I think I had too many
hamburger and dumplings.

826
00:52:18,585 --> 00:52:20,253
I'm still so full.

827
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,881
Thankfully, your clothes
didn't burst at the seams today.

828
00:52:22,964 --> 00:52:26,092
No, those clothes were
too small back then.

829
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:30,347
I'm sorry. Those were expensive clothes.

830
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,558
I want to stop hearing apologies
from you, Ms. Shin.

831
00:52:34,225 --> 00:52:35,060
What?

832
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:37,812
There are a lot of nice things to say
other than apologies.

833
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:40,690
Like how I'm cool,
or that it's fun to be with me.

834
00:52:45,946 --> 00:52:47,614
You're funny.

835
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:51,701
Aren't you tired?
Get some sleep if you are.

836
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:54,454
I'm fine. You must be
even more tired since you're driving.

837
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:02,796
What?

838
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,006
It's raining.

839
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,800
Darn it, this is out of the blue.

840
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:09,844
I didn't think about the rain.

841
00:53:10,428 --> 00:53:13,682
I didn't bring an umbrella.

842
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:18,770
<i>Mom, Dad!</i>

843
00:53:20,522 --> 00:53:22,273
<i>Dad!</i>

844
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:35,412
Get out.

845
00:53:36,162 --> 00:53:36,997
What?

846
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:41,751
I forgot that
I have an important meeting here today.

847
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:43,795
Go back to Seoul on your own.

848
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,550
Still, how could I go from here to--

849
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:50,260
Didn't you hear me?

850
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:55,181
Okay.

851
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,448
My bag!

852
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:13,450
President Kang, my bag!

853
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:15,285
My bag!

854
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:16,411
Darn it.

855
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:26,046
What in the world?

856
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,006
It's pouring.

857
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,143
What the hell is this?

858
00:54:47,233 --> 00:54:49,402
<i>Mom, Dad!</i>

859
00:54:50,278 --> 00:54:51,738
Dad!

860
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,032
-<i>Don't look!</i>
-<i>Mom!</i>

861
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:55,992
Dad!

862
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:57,160
Don't look.

863
00:54:57,243 --> 00:54:59,037
<i>Mom!</i>

864
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:02,749
-<i>Mom!</i>
-My God, Tae-moo!

865
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,292
<i>Dad!</i>

866
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:19,432
How could he just leave me
on the side of the road when it's raining?

867
00:55:20,141 --> 00:55:22,060
What an awful boss!

868
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,444
Don't die on me!

869
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,445
Darn it.

870
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:39,577
Damn it.

871
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:47,627
My heart fluttered
when he tied my shoelaces for me.

872
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,631
I must have been insane.

873
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,888
What's wrong with this thing?

874
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:58,615
<i>The number you dialed is not available.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

875
00:56:58,698 --> 00:56:59,866
Where did she go?

876
00:57:03,495 --> 00:57:06,289
Was this all part of his grand plan
to get his revenge on me?

877
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:10,543
Probably not.

878
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:12,962
I don't think he has the time for that.

879
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:19,802
Then why did he just abandon me
on the side of the road when it's raining.

880
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,804
<i>I don't like rainy days.</i>

881
00:57:22,597 --> 00:57:24,224
<i>Let's change the date instead.</i>

882
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:32,232
I left a phone here a while ago
so it could be charged.

883
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:34,234
Over there.

884
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,193
Here you go.

885
00:57:35,276 --> 00:57:36,152
Thank you.

886
00:57:37,445 --> 00:57:38,530
Ha-ri!

887
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:41,824
What?

888
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:43,743
What are you guys doing here?

889
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,828
Weren't you going to Busan?

890
00:57:45,912 --> 00:57:48,873
Min-woo's filming here instead.
Didn't you see my text?

891
00:57:49,874 --> 00:57:50,959
What? No.

892
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:54,754
You also said that you have a date today.
Are you here with your boyfriend?

893
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:56,881
Well, that's--

894
00:57:56,965 --> 00:57:59,300
Hey, no need to play shy between friends.

895
00:57:59,384 --> 00:58:02,095
Since we've met like this,
let us see your rich boyfriend.

896
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,013
Yes, let us meet him, Ha-ri.

897
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:05,682
-Let us see him!
-Let us see him!

898
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:09,310
Actually, I didn't come
with my boyfriend--

899
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:10,228
Babe.

900
00:58:26,578 --> 00:58:27,453
Did you wait long?

901
00:58:33,501 --> 00:58:34,502
Ha-ri.

902
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:36,546
Who is this?

903
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:37,547
Oh, he's--

904
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,965
Nice to meet you.

905
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,467
I'm Ha-ri's boyfriend, Kang Tae-moo.

If we want to take your friends' ego
down a notch.

908
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,346
Do you know what my love for you
and this credit card have in common?

909
00:59:27,055 --> 00:59:28,139
<i>They both have no limit.</i>

910
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,434
You're seriously out of your mind!

911
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:32,685
How did you two start dating?

912
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,563
I've never met anyone as crazy as Ha-ri.
It was refreshing.

913
00:59:35,647 --> 00:59:38,066
<i>Do you really not know
why I spent the entire weekend</i>

914
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:40,068
pretending to be your boyfriend
when I hate wasting my time

915
00:59:40,151 --> 00:59:41,611
<i>more than anything?</i>
