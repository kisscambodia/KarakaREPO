18
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,050
Doctor.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,500
I've apologized to you.

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,440
Why did you

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,750
ask us to come again?

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,120
I asked you to come

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,475
because there is something
I want to tell you

24
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:42,755
about your father's condition.

25
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:44,599
You don't need to worry about that.

26
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,575
How about this?

27
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:46,919
I hope you can contact

28
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,800
my dad's attending doctor.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,519
Yeah.

30
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,500
Is there any problem

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,550
you can't talk to me about?

32
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:53,050
Talk to you?

33
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,475
He hangs out in the bar all the time.

34
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:56,375
And he looks unprofessional.

35
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,319
How can I talk to him?

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,525
Yes.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,279
There's nothing to talk
about my illness.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
But we should

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,825
talk about what happened in the bar.

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,950
That is not over yet.

41
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
Sorry, Doctor.

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,199
Well,

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,725
Dr. Gu

44
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:12,639
asked us to come here.

45
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,839
Actually, we want to talk to him.

46
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,775
I'm Dr. Gao Xi's colleague,

47
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,075
the attending surgeon
of patient Lin Jianguo,

48
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,479
Gu Wei.

(Gu Wei Gastroenterology Center)

50

(Attending Physician
Associate Professor Director Assistant)

51
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,675
So, you're my dad's attending doctor.

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,300
We didn't know it.

53
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:38,679
Nice to meet you, Dr. Gu.

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,639
I've seen the medical records

55
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,639
of Lin Jianguo.

56
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,339
I suggest you

57
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,100
take a second test.

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,759
Why?

59
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,500
We've had

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,559
a gastroscopy earlier.

61
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,825
Yeah, Dr. Gu.

62
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,199
What's going on now?

63
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,479
Don't be nervous.

64
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,550
There is nothing wrong

65
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,839
with the last test.

66
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,919
Those are indeed inflammatory cells,

67
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,250
and the result shows

68
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,520
it's a stomach ulcer.

69
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,240
But the ulcer has a unique shape.

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,725
In my experience,

71
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,240
I suggest you take another test.

72
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,340
- Should we also...
- All right.

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,039
What are you worried about?

74
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,800
Don't I know my own body?

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,525
I just have a stomach ulcer!

76
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,150
What's the matter?

77
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,839
Dr. Gao, you arrived just in time.

78
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,520
Well,

79
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,525
you've been treating my husband.

80
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:21,559
Would you please tell us

81
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,875
why we should take a second test?

82
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,440
The reason Dr. Gu asked you

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,320
to take a second test

84
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,160
is out of caution

85
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,500
lest the condition should get worse.

86
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,300
That's not necessary.

87
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,759
Just prescribe some medicine.

88
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,600
I won't be hospitalized.

89
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,700
Dr. Gao.

90
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,520
Do you need to check the result again?

91
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,625
We can't just take

92
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,000
- whatever Dr. Gu said.
- All right.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,440
Yes.

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,080
Should we listen to the doctor
or listen to you?

95
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,880
Hold your tongue.

96
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,160
We're communicating.

97
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,650
Go outside. Hurry.

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,900
Let's go.

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,919
Sorry, Dr. Gao.

100
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,150
We'll take your advice

101
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,199
and stay in the hospital for treatment.

102
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,325
Thank you, Dr. Gao.

103
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,919
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

104
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,075
We'll go through
the admission procedure first.

105
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,725
Gu Wei.

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,359
You asked a patient who just took a test

107
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,600
to take a test again.

108
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,900
What are you doing?

109
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,300
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,375
I should have told you first.

111
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,239
I just don't want
to leave anything open.

112
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,320
I know you're always committed
to your patients.

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,875
But it's my duty

114
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,275
as the doctor in charge
to make the diagnosis.

115
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,325
But you intervened
despite the diagnosis.

116
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:35,150
You're risking your future.

117
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,559
I'm just concerned about his condition.

118
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,275
The shape
of his stomach ulcer is special.

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,200
I've seen this kind of situation twice.

120
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,040
There was a colleague

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,959
who asked the patient to have
one more test out of good intentions.

122
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,000
The patient was fine,

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,132
but he went to a reporter and media,

124
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,450
claiming that
the hospital cheated patients for money

125
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,375
and the doctor worked on commission.

126
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,375
The doctor who was just
being conscientious

127
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,736
got punished in the end.

128
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,525
Gu Wei!

129
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:57,925
Obviously that family

130
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,500
has a problem with you.

131
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,675
What if they complain about you
after they leave?

132
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,925
What will you do then?

133
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,150
Calm down, Gao Xi.

134
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,679
I know what you mean. Don't worry.

135
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:09,150
I only gave them a suggestion.

136
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,775
They can decide what to do.

137
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,750
A patient with a gastric ulcer

138
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,000
should be admitted for treatment.

139
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,325
Gu Wei.

140
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,225
Since you still have a passion
for treating patients,

141
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,200
do you want

142
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,650
to reconsider the transfer?

143
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
I've made up my mind.

144
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,225
If you want to transfer

145
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,760
because of what happened to our teacher…

146
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,375
It's really not your fault.

147
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't take it...

148
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,040
- Gao Xi.
- Sorry.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,640
I know you don't want to hear this.

150
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,450
But I hope you can...

151
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,275
I have a meeting.

152
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,125
Why is my life so hard?

153
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,519
You sweet-talked me
before we got married.

154
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,200
You said you won't let me suffer a bit,

155
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,850
and you will listen to me.

156
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,525
What about now?

157
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,399
No wonder my dad said

158
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,725
you look like the King of Hell.

159
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,125
And he did everything
to stop me from marrying you.

160
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,550
I've been working hard

161
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,559
for our family over these years.

162
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,959
I do everything.

163
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,950
What have I done wrong?

164
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,559
Now

165
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,700
I have no say in the family at all.

166
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,275
No one takes what I say seriously.

167
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,875
All right. All right.

168
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,225
You just want me to stay in the hospital

169
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,525
and get treatment, right?

170
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,279
I'll stay.

171
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,700
I'll get treatment.

172
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Really?

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,575
Why would I lie to you?

174
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,050
I'll get changed right now.

175
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,475
And you!

176
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,425
Are you going to offend doctors
with your nonsense

177
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:26,200
and embarrass me again?

178
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,025
I... I won't.

179
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,040
I won't talk nonsense anymore.

180
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,959
I swear.

181
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,359
I will respect doctors from now on.

182
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,700
I'll respect doctors a lot.

183
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,079
Get back to the ward

184
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,325
and get changed.

185
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Leave me alone for a while.

186
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,239
Okay. Okay.

187
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,775
Go!

188
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:42,974
- Yes.
- Yes.

189
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:51,880
Here, Director.

190
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,525
Dr. Yan, you go ahead first.

191
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,775
Okay.

192
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,450
I'll make a brief introduction.

193
00:07:58,825 --> 00:07:59,925
This patient

194
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:01,450
is male, 28 years old.

195
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,475
He has a tumor
in the head of the pancreas.

196
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:04,850
My advice

197
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,250
is pancreaticoduodenectomy.

198
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,399
I've performed
such operations many times.

199
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,875
It won't be a problem.

200
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,900
Gu.

201
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,925
What do you think?

202
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,500
The patient is young,

203
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,200
and the CT scan shows

204
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,925
that the tumor of the patient's
pancreatic head is benign.

205
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,475
The tumor markers are normal.

206
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,150
If we do

207
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,000
a pancreaticoduodenectomy now,

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
it's going

209
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,425
to impact his future life

210
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,785
a lot.

211
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,400
Therefore, I personally recommend

212
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,700
regular follow-ups
and close observation.

213
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't perform surgery on him now.

214
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,675
If the tumor is found to have grown

215
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,175
in the follow-up examination,

216
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,919
we should consider

217
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,225
the local resection
of the pancreatic head tumor,

218
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,250
and try to avoid
a pancreaticoduodenectomy.

219
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,900
I agree with Dr. Gu.

220
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,475
Let's keep observing.

221
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,250
Is there anything else
you want to discuss?

222
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,125
No.

223
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,875
Fine. Make the rounds.

224
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:13,280
Brother.

225
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,679
You do consider for patients.

226
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,440
Cool.

227
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,159
Let's go.

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,825
Dr. Du.

229
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,500
Learn well from your brother.

230
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,675
No wonder he is

231
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,300
the Vice President's ideal son-in-law.

232
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,950
Dr. Yan.

233
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,875
I'm talking to you.

234
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,719
Do you hear me?

235
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,675
After

236
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:29,875
such a serious medical accident,

237
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,375
he is still doing well in the hospital.

238
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,414
What do you mean?

239
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,450
Ignore him.

240
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,625
Make the rounds.

241
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,950
This is for you.

242
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,719
You don't like it?

243
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,925
Well,

244
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,125
I don't like flower.

245
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,875
I only like silver.

246
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,900
Incisive.

247
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,925
You are different indeed.

248
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,075
It's worth losing 300 grams of weight

249
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,719
for missing you the whole night.

250
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,479
300 grams?

251
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,080
Isn't that a little insincere?

252
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,925
A doctor once told me

253
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,599
that the weight of the heart

254
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,625
is only about 300 grams.

255
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,175
From the moment I saw you,

256
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,850
I gave you my heart.

257
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,675
This one's kind of new.

258
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,239
What else is new?

259
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,000
I can tell you

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
anything you want to hear.

261
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,475
But how about we

262
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,195
introduce ourselves properly first?

263
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,800
My name is Gu Xiao.

264
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,400
What's yours?

265
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,600
What's the rush?

266
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,950
The relationship between people

267
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,075
is like this glass of wine,

268
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,880
the longer the mellower.

269
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,400
If you drink it in a hurry,

270
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,750
you will miss the texture.

271
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,825
I have plenty of time
to get to know you.

272
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,679
I have a lifetime.

273
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,000
Why don't you answer your phone?

274
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,875
You're the most important person now.

275
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,775
Hello?

276
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,119
Okay.

277
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,400
Well, see you later.

278
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,875
Sadly,

279
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,800
I have no time.

280
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,050
Got an appointment. Bye.

281
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,025
Hello, Angela.

282
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,200
I was busy.

283
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,520
Sorry.

284
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't be mad at me.

285
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,719
I got you a present.

286
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,150
I'll see you later.

287
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,919
Dr. Gu, how is it?

288
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,960
Ms. Li.

289
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
Gu...

290
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,150
Dr. Gu is here.

291
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,175
Qiuqiu, you are doing well.

292
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,450
I asked you to buy something.

293
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,039
- Don't worry.
- Why did it take you so long?

294
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,799
Give him more

295
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,599
digestible food.

296
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,000
I see.

297
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,650
Qiuqiu, have a good rest.

298
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,425
I'm leaving.

299
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,429
Um.

300
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,559
Okay.

301
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,800
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

302
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,440
Qiuqiu, see what I bought for you.

303
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,350
- Snacks!
- Here.

304
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,640
Sorry.

305
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,119
Qiuqiu can't have snacks.

306
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,000
Why?

307
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,250
Qiuqiu has
a mechanical intestinal obstruction.

308
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,375
He needs to follow a special diet.

309
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:38,640
Sorry.

310
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,719
Sorry, Dr. Gu.

311
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,100
We didn't know it.

312
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,100
By the way,

313
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,550
have you decided

314
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,700
about doing a gastroscopy?

315
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,450
Gastroscopy... I think we should...

316
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,900
We're still thinking about it,

317
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,450
still thinking about it.

318
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,900
Um.

319
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,225
Qiuqiu.

320
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,550
What's going on?

321
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,100
What did I tell you?

322
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,479
Can you eat snacks?

323
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,300
No.

324
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,599
Good boy.

325
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:08,200
You're such a well-behaved

326
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,050
good kid.

327
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,025
It would be a lot easier for us

328
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,799
if all the patients

329
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,650
were as well-behaved as you.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,919
Innuendo.

331
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,475
You think I don't understand it?

332
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,760
Qiuqiu, have a good rest.

333
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,875
I'm leaving.

334
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,500
By the way, Qiuqiu.

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,325
Don't eat snacks.

336
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,150
Do you hear me?

337
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,550
Good boy.

338
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,575
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

339
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:33,479
I'm really sorry.

340
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,799
- The good intentions went awry.
- It's okay.

341
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,550
It's okay.

342
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,119
Come on, Ms. Li.

343
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,050
Mr. Lin, listen to me.

344
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,640
We can't trust Dr. Gu.

345
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,559
He's just a pretty boy.

346
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,900
I just heard

347
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,760
that he got promoted through nepotism,

348
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,175
and he had a medical accident.

349
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:48,581
Can we trust someone like him?

350
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,650
Is it true?

351
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,369
It's true.

352
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,675
Mr. Gao.

353
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
I would like to know

354
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,280
when my transfer application

355
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,700
will be approved.

356
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,075
I know

357
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,039
you want to transfer

358
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,825
because of what happened to Liang.

359
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,675
I just think it's a pity.

360
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,075
You know better than anyone

361
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,239
how rare

362
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,750
a good surgeon is.

363
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,775
I'm holding back on your application.

364
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,425
I hope you can reconsider it.

365
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,175
If you still insist,

366
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,400
I'll give it to
the Administration Department.

367
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,000
Thank you, Vice President Gao.

368
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,850
Gu.

369
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,325
Do you still remember

370
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,350
your initial thoughts

371
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,850
when you decided to be a doctor?

372
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:00,225
To save people.

373
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,775
That's what Liang expected of you.

374
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,080
Since you know it,

375
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,775
why not stick to it?

376
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,685
(Union Surgical Residency Manual
Chief editor: Xu Xiequn)

377
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:15,685

not for comfort, fame, or fortune.)

00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,559
(Keep saving lives and don't forget
the original purpose. Liang Zhou)

379
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,700
You asked Xi's patient
who just got examined

380
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,400
to come back and take a second test.

381
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,919
As a doctor,

382
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,475
you're doing thankless work.

383
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,000
But it just shows

384
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,900
your commitment to your patients.

385
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:49,000
(Union Surgical Residency Manual)

386
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:18,280
Come back!

387
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,125
Come back!

388
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,300
How are you feeling these days?

389
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,550
I'm okay.

390
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,400
Do you have hematemesis

391
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,806
or black stool?

392
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,050
Hematemesis...

393
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,525
Yes or no?

394
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,040
No.

395
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,880
That's good.

396
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,725
Be sure to keep me informed

397
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:48,975
if there are any of these situations.

398
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,359
Any other questions?

399
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,425
No, no.

400
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:54,439
No questions.

401
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,359
I'll leave.

402
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,359
Keep yourself rested.

403
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,239
Thank you, Dr. Gao.

404
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,250
Thank you.

405
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,925
Tell the doctor
if anything is not right.

406
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,359
I know.

407
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,150
Dr. Gao!

408
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,199
What's the matter?

409
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:08,905
I want to ask you something.

410
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,350
If my father

411
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,125
has hematemesis

412
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,250
or black stool

413
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,725
that you just mentioned,

414
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,300
it means...

415
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,959
If he has such symptoms,

416
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,200
we'll need further treatment.

417
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:24,346
I see. Thank you.

418
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,160
Hello? Speak louder.

419
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,975
I can't hear you.

420
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,475
What?

421
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,625
Well,

422
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,025
I need to go back to the company.

423
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,439
Go ahead.

424
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,425
You know,

425
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,959
as one of those working in finance,

426
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,319
I often work at night.

427
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,000
I...

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,280
I'll make it up to you later.

429
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,119
I'm leaving.

430
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,950
See you later.

431
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,100
You don't even like
bossy and successful men?

432
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,950
What's your type?

433
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,525
Let me see if I'm your type.

434
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,700
Hello, Zhixiao.

435
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:27,325
Sansan.

436
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,006
I'm extremely worried right now.

437
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,760
Should I ask Mr. Lin

438
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,325
to take a test again?

439
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,750
You don't know it.

440
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,469
When the doctor visited him today,

441
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,225
Mr. Lin lied.

442
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,175
He can't fool Ms. Li and me.

443
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,350
When the doctor asked him questions,

444
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,000
he looked shifty-eyed

445
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,800
and he stuttered.

446
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,160
It was very abnormal.

447
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,640
I think he lied to us.

448
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,475
Nothing has happened yet.

449
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:50,880
Don't scare yourself.

450
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,475
You also think he's fine, right?

451
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,250
Nothing will happen to Mr. Lin.

452
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,775
I think that doctor is
totally unreliable.

453
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,075
I can't do everything he said.

454
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,150
Well,

455
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,640
I need you to do me a favor.

456
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,550
What?

457
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,775
No problem. I'll find you

458
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,599
a better doctor.

459
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,520
Don't worry!

460
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,119
Okay.

461
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,675
I'm hanging up.

462
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,200
You need a doctor?

463
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,925
I know someone.

464
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,680
Dr. Gu, please take a look
at this medical record.

465
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,880
They are fine.

466
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,280
Just keep close observation.

467
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,400
Okay.

468
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,600
Well,

469
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,680
you need to submit an application

470
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,250
to stay in the ward
after visiting hours.

471
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:39,475
Well,

472
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,719
will anyone be coming...?

473
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,719
The nurse will come.

474
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,650
Okay.

475
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,575
Hey.

476
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,225
Why are you still here?

477
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,900
Dr. Du.

478
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,239
It's Mr. Lin's first time

479
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:44,239
to be hospitalized.

480
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,850
I'm really worried about him.

481
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,025
How about this?

482
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:47,959
I,

483
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,175
I won't bother other patients.

484
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:51,359
I'll just stand here.

485
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,800
I won't go in.

486
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
If anything

487
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,675
happens to Mr. Lin at night,

488
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,225
I can go inside and take care of him.

489
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,575
Dr. Du.

490
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,040
Is it okay?

491
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,750
Du Wenjun.

492
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,250
You moved my cup
60 degrees to the right

493
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,950
by two centimeters, right?

494
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:09,025
Do you want me

495
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:10,550
to put you in the sterile room
for disinfection again?

496
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:20,150
Still not talking?

497
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:21,975
Fine.

498
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,520
I'm going to have a good chat with you

499
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,725
about the ten rules of the break room.

500
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,800
Where are you going?

501
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,225
Good evening, Dr. Gu.

502
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,875
I didn't see anything.

503
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:39,725
I didn't see anything.

504
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:40,605
It's you!

505
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:42,425
Yes, it's me.

506
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,250
So, it's you who touched my cup.

507
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,525
I swear

508
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,966
I didn't touch that cup.

509
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,925
Even if I did, it might be done

510
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:51,200
indirectly.

511
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,725
I didn't want to come.

512
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,000
It's Dr. Du...

513
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,920
What he did

514
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,479
badly violated the hospital's rules.

515
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,950
He might be punished.

516
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,760
Get out.

517
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:03,175
The son-in-law-to-be
of the Vice President

518
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,719
takes the hospital as private property.

519
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,100
What are you talking about?

520
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,600
I didn't say anything.

521
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,625
Don't be angry, Dr. Gu.

522
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,125
I'm leaving right now.

523
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,525
I turned it back for you.

524
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,075
You got it out of place again.

525
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,520
Don't blame Dr. Du.

526
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,175
He did it out of kindness.

527
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,950
He cares about me, the patient's family,

528
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,625
not so cold as you are.

529
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,275
You even have no sympathy

530
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:38,750
for a patient's family.

531
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,700
How should I believe

532
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,675
you are dutiful to your patients?

533
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,160
If I am not,

534
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,350
why did I ask your father
for another test?

535
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,000
Who knows

536
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
what you said is true or not?

537
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,900
I just checked online.

538
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,025
As for my father's symptoms,

539
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,800
it may not be cancer.

540
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,440
You can check online afterward.

541
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,150
Don't come to see doctors.

542
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,520
We are not professional.

543
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,640
Do you know

544
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
a casual word from a doctor

545
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,650
may mean a lot to us?

546
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,959
I'm worried about my dad.

547
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,079
I'd surely check online...

548
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,950
Fine. Stop it.

549
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,475
Go out.

550
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,200
Alright.

551
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,425
I don't wanna stay here at all.

552
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,325
Ms. Li.

553
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,079
Rest assured.

554
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,079
Ms. Li, I'll talk with you outside.

555
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,550
Yes. Yes. Yes.

556
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,975
He's already asleep.

557
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,175
Don't worry.

558
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,450
I'm good.

559
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,040
I'm not tired.

560
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,239
It's not tiring at all.

561
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:40,175
Rest assured.

562
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,450
Good night.

563
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,050
OK.

564
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,525
Bye-bye, Ms. Li.

565
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,280
Go in.

566
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,250
No.

567
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:01,439

from staying up late.)

573
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,599
Be sure to tell me

574
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,520
when this patient is on an IV.

575
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:17,400
Get it.

576
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,450
Dr. Du.

577
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,400
Miss Lin.

578
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,239
Thank you.

579
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:20,850
Don't mention it.

580
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,525
Take it back.

581
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,075
Tonight,

582
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,175
don't forget to apply again.

583
00:29:24,175 --> 00:29:25,199
I won't.

584
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,625
And thanks for your book,

585
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,026
ice pack and tips.

586
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,650
Book? Ice pack?

587
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:35,450
They're not mine.

588
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,500
It's so dull.

589
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,981
The tasteless food every day.

590
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,359
I have no appetite at all.

591
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,000
Then what?

592
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,175
Should I hold a banquet for you?

593
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,199
If you hold a banquet for me,

594
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,400
I'll call you Master Lin.

595
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,525
Stop joking around. Hurry up.

596
00:30:00,475 --> 00:30:01,200
Hello?

597
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:01,920
Wei.

598
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,640
I called you all morning.

599
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,975
Why didn't you answer?

600
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,950
I was occupied. I didn't hear it.

601
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,100
What's the matter?

602
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,959
Gu Xiao.

603
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,700
I'll transfer to another department.

604
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
You know it.

605
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,425
You can ask others to do it.

606
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,450
Don't worry.

607
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,550
This patient seems to be
in your hospital.

608
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,625
He is Lin Jianguo.

609
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,650
What? Don't spit it out. Eat it.

610
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,800
No vegetable at all?

611
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,640
No. No. No.

612
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,175
Add some oil, OK?

613
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:33,239
You are so demanding.

614
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,300
Hurry.

615
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,520
Hi, Sansan, how is it?

616
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,700
Zhixiao, I've made an appointment
with the new doctor.

617
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,920
I'll send you the time and place.

618
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,100
Don't be late.

619
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,225
Really?

620
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,280
Great! Great! Thank you.

621
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,975
I'll call you later.

622
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,050
I'm hanging up.

623
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,150
Open your mouth big.

624
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,600
What is that look?

625
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,000
Don't worry, Mr. Lin.

626
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,959
I'm your daughter after all.

627
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,275
I'll be filial to you.

628
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,850
Zhixiao.

629
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,800
I went to great lengths

630
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,975
to find this expert,

631
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,680
who is even famous nationwide.

632
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,950
He's young,

633
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,450
but an associate professor already.

634
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,800
He spared time to meet you today.

635
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,760
You must perform well

636
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,475
when he comes.

637
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,680
Rest assured.

638
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,575
As long as he can cure Mr. Lin,

639
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:26,816
I will do anything.

640
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,850
You are shining

641
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,225
from head to toe.

642
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,125
Is this necessary to see an expert?

643
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,475
You know nothing.

644
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:38,800
What if he's hard to deal with?

645
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,475
I can use the honey trap.

646
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:41,195
Right?

647
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,160
That'd be a tough mission.

648
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,950
Comrade, I count on you.

649
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,050
Tell me.

650
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,479
What was wrong

651
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,475
with that unreliable doctor?

652
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,000
That Gu Wei

653
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,959
is terribly unreliable.

654
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,025
He's bumptious,

655
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:58,119
giving casual diagnosis to patients.

656
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,125
Moreover,

657
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,225
all his colleagues know

658
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:02,800
he got the position by nepotism.

659
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,760
Is such a guy trustworthy?

660
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,850
No!

661
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,199
Is he handsome?

662
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:06,959
Is his figure good?

663
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,200
A pretty boy?

664
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,200
That doesn't matter.

665
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,920
The point is,

666
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,800
as long as this expert is reliable

667
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,239
and willing to treat Mr. Lin,

668
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,800
I'll transfer him to another hospital
right away.

669
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,479
Yes, he is reliable.

670
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,239
Trust me.

671
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,650
I definitely trust you,

672
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,300
at least more than that pretty boy.

673
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,959
Yes.

674
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,600
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

675
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,800
That pretty boy!

676
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,319
Is he that doctor?

677
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,300
That pretty boy?

678
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:47,800
Gu Xiao.

679
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,040
- Come out with me.
- What?

680
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,675
What? What? Speak!

681
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,439
Is that the expert you got for me?

682
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,125
Is this the way you reliably help me?

683
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,325
You didn't tell me

684
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:06,439
Gu Wei was that doctor.

685
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:07,800
Also, you two spoke ill of him

686
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
just now.

687
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,119
I'm wondering how he'll punish me!

688
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm being blamed by both sides!

689
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,050
Did we say it wrong?

690
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:14,599
No. No.

691
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,319
I am wrong.

692
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,225
OK?

693
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,075
You didn't know who the doctor was?

694
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,959
Why didn't you ask me? Are you a fool?

695
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,079
Yes, I'm a fool.

696
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,800
It's all my fault!

697
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
- OK?
- Break up.

698
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,920
Are we already together?

699
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't even know it.

700
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,875
Let's be together then.

701
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,079
Break up.

702
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,375
Did you know

703
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:44,800
it's me you'd meet today?

704
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,319
Are you tricking me on purpose?

705
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,800
I will never joke

706
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,775
about my patient's things.

707
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,520
But I think you are joking.

708
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,680
Mr. Lin is one of

709
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,599
your patients,

710
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,800
but he is my only father.

711
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,925
Is it wrong for me

712
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:58,550
to hear more authoritative opinions?

713
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,725
I clearly know

714
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:01,359
your father's condition,

715
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,114
and how much it matters

716
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:04,119
to you and your family.

717
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,675
That's why I am here today.

718
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:06,650
I'm responsible

719
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,080
for every patient's condition.

720
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,919
I hope you can calm down

721
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:10,825
and think rationally.

722
00:34:10,825 --> 00:34:11,679
What do you mean?

723
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,675
You mean I'm irrational and not calm?

724
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:15,360
I don't trust you, so you think

725
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,800
I'm irrational?

726
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,520
Please think about it

727
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,825
without prejudice.

728
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,575
Why do you hate me?

729
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,675
Why don't you trust me?

730
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,439
Just because of our encounter

731
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,550
in the bar?

732
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,800
Or some rumors make you think

733
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,525
I'm unreliable?

734
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,850
Do you know the story
of Khwarezm's messenger?

735
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,400
Yes.

736
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,425
Khwarezm was an ancient state
in Central Asia.

737
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,439
Messengers who brought bad news
to the king

738
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,520
were fed to tigers.

739
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,080
Messengers did nothing wrong.

740
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,750
If bad news already happened,

741
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,479
killing them

742
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,639
wouldn't change anything.

743
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,000
Right?

744
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:07,125
No one wants to believe themselves

745
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,800
or their loved ones are badly ill.

746
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,350
You hate me,

747
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,200
just because I said

748
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,874
the two words, cancer.

749
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,840
So, you tried to convince yourself

750
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,000
with all those reasons

751
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,550
that I'm untrustworthy.

752
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,639
In fact, whether your father

753
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,000
is well or not,

754
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,800
as his family

755
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,120
who he lives with every day,

756
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,350
you know it better than us.

757
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:33,925
I'm not here

758
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,600
to trick you.

759
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,475
I just don't want his treatment

760
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,550
to be delayed for some hearsays.

761
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,919
That's it.

762
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,875
Come to me after you decide.

763
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,650
Zhixiao.

764
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,925
Has he left?

765
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,225
Yes, he has.

766
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,325
Sorry, Zhixiao.

767
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,000
I didn't know

768
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,719
Gu Xiao's so unreliable.

769
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,950
He promised me before.

770
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:19,844
I've taught him a lesson.

771
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,120
It's fine, Sansan.

772
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,200
It's not your fault.

773
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,950
Whatever,

774
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,439
as you said,

775
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,725
he's a jinx.

776
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,520
But he does look good,

777
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,300
a born pretty boy.

778
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,225
What's wrong?

779
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,080
Do you know Qiuqiu's condition?

780
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,280
Yes, the doctor on rounds

781
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,120
said it was

782
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,159
mechanical intestinal obstruction.

783
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes. Yes. Yes.

784
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,950
He had conservative treatment,

785
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,840
but it didn't work.

786
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,575
It's said that he needs surgery.

787
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,425
You know their family situation.

788
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,320
He's gonna be discharged.

789
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,600
That's not good.

790
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
He can't have the surgery

791
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,350
if he's discharged.

792
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,525
Should we

793
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,000
help them?

794
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,239
He can't be discharged like this.

795
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,875
I've been thinking about it.

796
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,120
What do you think, honey?

797
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,639
We may help them more or less.

798
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,239
OK.

799
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,500
I'm gonna secretly

800
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,661
give them the money.

801
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:40,950
Unbelievable.

802
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,375
The one who wants the treatment
can't afford it.

803
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,500
while the one who can afford it
doesn't want the treatment.

804
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,760
(In-patient)

805
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,000
Call me when you miss me.

806
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,875
Got it?

807
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:58,625
Good boy.

808
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,320
- Yes. Bye-bye.
- Qiuqiu.

809
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,000
Come.

810
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,175
Let's go home.

811
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,120
Let me walk you out.

812
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,975
Qiuqiu.

813
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,150
Dr. Du.

814
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,000
Sorry, Qiuqiu.

815
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,879
You may have to

816
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,360
stay longer here with me.

817
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,959
Come.

818
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,600
Qiuqiu, be good.

819
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,850
Go to have fun alone.

820
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,560
Ma'am.

821
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,500
This is the money for Qiuqiu's surgery.

822
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,120
No. No. No.

823
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,375
Dr. Du, it...

824
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,280
It's not from me.

825
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,360
Dr. Gu raised funds

826
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,320
for your son in the hospital.

827
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,975
He also gave a lot himself.

828
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,239
- Take it.
- No.

829
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,360
Your son's condition is urgent.

830
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,625
Thanks.

831
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,125
Thank you.

832
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,550
Dr. Du.

833
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,639
Is it really from Dr. Gu?

834
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:37,560
Yes.

835
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,959
He usually looks cold,

836
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,320
a little unkind.

837
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,040
That's not who he is.

838
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,120
Actually, he is warmhearted,

839
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,600
and very kind.

840
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,019
That's who he is.

841
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:49,625
In that case,

842
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:51,280
I don't even dare to ask you.

843
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,399
Miss Lin Zhixiao.

844
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,280
Let me put it this way.

845
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
If it were not for Dr. Gu,

846
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,925
I couldn't come this far,

847
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,360
not only for us,

848
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,719
but also for many patients.

849
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,840
Where is Dr. Gu?

850
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,479
I wanna say thanks in person.

851
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:03,400
Now?

852
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,200
He's supposed to be on rounds.

853
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,520
Thanks.

854
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:09,911
What's wrong?

855
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,825
Heartbeats, 130.

856
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:13,950
Blood pressure down to 80.

857
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,425
The patient may have
a postoperative abdominal hemorrhage.

858
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,679
Inject more fluid.

859
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,679
Quick rehydration.

860
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,800
Contact the Transfusion Department now.

861
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,959
Prepare five units of red blood cells.

862
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:21,600
Prepare the operation now.

863
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,239
- Go.
- OK.

864
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,560
Is the Operating Room ready?

865
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,000
- Yes.
- This way.

866
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,600
Coming!

867
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,159
This way. This way.

868
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,600
OK. OK.

869
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,520
Take the patient to the Operating Room.

870
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,360
Hurry.

871
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,150
OK. OK.

872
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:49,919
Operating trolley. This way.

873
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:50,679
Coming. Coming.

874
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,360
This way. This way.

875
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,000
OK. OK.

876
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,679
OK.

877
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,919
Excuse me. Excuse me.

878
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:54,500
Come.

879
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,725
Dr. Gu, who will do this operation?

880
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:57,239
Yeah.

881
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:57,959
You may do it.

882
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,120
He's in critical condition.

883
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,639
There's no time. Hurry.

884
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,750
- Dr. Gu. Hurry.
- Yes, Dr. Gu.

885
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,479
Yes, what should we do?

886
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:04,750
Could you do it?

887
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,625
Why are you here?

888
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,050
I heard you just did
an emergency operation.

889
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,600
Thank you.

890
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,725
That means

891
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:07,765
you don't have to be transferred,
doesn't it?

892
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,725
You can do surgeries.

893
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,050
I know my condition best.

894
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,250
Gu Wei.

895
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,500
We both know

896
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,175
you can do it.

897
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:21,439
Why don't you...?

898
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,325
Sorry.

899
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,879
I'm gonna get changed.

900
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,175
I have to make rounds.

901
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:48,719
Blood in stool.

902
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,200
Grandpa Lin, would you play chess?

903
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,239
Miss Zhixiao.

904
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,575
Grandpa Lin...

905
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,025
Where is Ms. Li?

906
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,100
She's back to cook.

907
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,825
Mr. Lin.

908
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,800
Why don't you have

909
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,159
another gastroscopy check?

910
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,350
I've had it once.

911
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,350
Why another check?

912
00:42:58,679 --> 00:42:59,775
Again and again,

913
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:00,950
are you making it hard on me?

914
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:03,550
I am not.

915
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:05,080
Let's do it again

916
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,600
and we can be reassured. Right?

917
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,300
It's for your good.

918
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,919
Don't be headstrong.

919
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,479
Reassured? About whom?

920
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,959
I'm very well.

921
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,150
How am I headstrong?

922
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,675
For my good?

923
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,025
I ask you to study
for a master's degree,

924
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:18,475
and go to a normal school.
That's good for you.

925
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:19,354
Will you go?

926
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,050
What are you talking about?

927
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,410
That's not the same thing.

928
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,360
Don't be ridiculous.

929
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,525
Am I ridiculous?

930
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,439
How dare you talk to elders like this?

931
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,950
Mr. Lin.

932
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,950
Alright. Alright.

933
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,450
I don't wanna talk with you.

934
00:43:33,919 --> 00:43:35,125
Go out now.

935
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:36,825
But...

936
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:37,790
Go!

937
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,475
Fine.

938
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,175
Lin Zhixiao, you...

939
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,775
I'm fine.

940
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,400
Mr. Lin...

941
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,199
He doesn't wanna do gastroscopy anymore,

942
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,675
but I'll convince him.

943
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:18,550
=The Oath of Love=

944
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,725
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
I admit you're a good doctor soon.

945
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:23,469
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
It's... It's just that I thought

946
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:24,775
you were a bad guy.

947
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:27,641
You keep playing cold,

948
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:29,475
OK?

949
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:30,925
Yes, hands in pockets,

950
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:31,975
in a cool way.

951
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,250
On your first day in the hospital,

952
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,098
I left the break room for you.

953
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:39,425
Hey, I earned it myself, OK?

954
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,925
What about the ice pack and note
the next morning?

955
00:44:42,925 --> 00:44:43,975
Yes, the note!

956
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,250
Wasn't it from Dr. Du?

957
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,638
Was it from you?

958
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,910
Who else could it be?

959
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:54,650
Wow, what the hell was that?

960
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,250
The irony of fate!

961
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,300
Dr. Gu, I'm wrong.

962
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,438
I'm so sorry.

963
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:01,438
I should study detective science
in college.

964
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,450
Sorry, I'm bowing to you.

965
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,050
If an apology is useful...

966
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,875
- Let's talk.
- …why call the police?

967
