(Nurse Station)

19
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:35,475
Give me a piece of paper, please.

20
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,839
I need to fill in
the discharge application.

21
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:38,279
Your treatment is not over yet.

22
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,475
I'll discuss it with the doctor.

23
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,575
Just hand me the paper and pen

24
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:43,995
and leave me alone.

25
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,200
Mr. Lin.

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,879
It was you

27
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,160
who said those frightening things

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,650
to my family
or they wouldn't be in a panic.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,559
What exactly did you say
to Lin Zhixiao?

30
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,325
Even she's forcing me
to do a re-check.

31
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,550
Mr. Lin,

32
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,399
would you please calm down now?

33
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,925
I can understand

34
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:21,000
how you feel right now.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,175
I've seen many patients

36
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,440
who felt the same way as you do.

37
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,946
You feel that

38
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,375
you're thinking for your family.

39
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,096
You don't want them
to worry about you.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,525
You're not me.

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,479
But have you ever thought that

42
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,725
if something happens to you one day,

43
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,725
your family will feel guilty
for the rest of their lives?

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,075
Because they'll feel that they lose you

45
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,275
because they haven't insisted
on giving you the treatment.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,975
Losing temper
is not gonna solve any problem.

47
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,225
I just saw your daughter crying.

48
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,850
Do you want her

49
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,950
to live with doubts and worries
all the time?

50
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,025
Well,

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,650
do you still need this?

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,550
Zhixiao. You're coming right on time.

53
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,875
What's wrong?

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,625
Listen.

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,720
As soon as I got back,

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,875
your father told me

57
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,125
that he'd love
to have another gastroscopy.

58
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,065
Do you think
he's having a hard time?

59
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,575
He told you so?

60
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:39,200
- He's gonna do one more gastroscopy?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,825
It's okay. No worries.

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,875
I persuaded him to do it just now.

63
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,575
Why did he listen to you today?

64
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,275
It's not like what he'd do.

65
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,575
I have no idea either.

66
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,160
When I was talking to him,

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,475
he refused to do the check.

68
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:54,875
Maybe he has figured it out now.

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,919
Your father is a freaky man.

70
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,875
I'm gonna buy something.
I'll be back later.

71
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,736
Okay.

72
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,975
Hello. Bed 9 from In-patient.

73
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:35,200
(Digestive Endoscopy Center)

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,519
Okay, you can go in now.

75
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,550
Okay, thanks.

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
This is Bed 9.

77
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:48,559
Okay, guys, just wait here for a moment.

78
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,225
Okay.

79
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,450
This is a biopsy sample
from Gastroenterology.

80
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,950
(Date: March 13, 2019
Name: Lin Jianguo)

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,640
Hello.

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,519
Hi, this is Gu Wei.

83
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,325
Dr. Gu.

84
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,000
I'd like to know

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,225
if the pathology results of the biopsy

86
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,320
of the patient in Bed 9 has come out.

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,725
Hold on, I'll take a look.

88
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,225
Hello, Dr. Gu, are you still there?

89
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:36,440
Yes, I am. Go ahead.

90
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,250
Mm.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,525
Okay, I see.

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,175
Do you know the situation of Bed 9?

93
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,925
Mm.

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,519
People including the director

95
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,750
were very appreciative
of what you've done on this occasion.

96
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,800
From the perspective of the patient,

97
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,100
being diagnosed with cancer

98
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,500
is not something to be happy about.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,225
You misunderstood me.

100
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,359
What I mean is that the timely diagnosis

101
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,525
for Bed 9

102
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,400
is a blessing.

103
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,279
I do feel happy for him

104
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,275
that he could meet
such a good doctor like you.

105
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,600
Sorry.

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,925
I didn't use the right word.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
I know you didn't mean it.

108
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,875
No worries.

109
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,375
Then…

110
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:26,519
Would you consider…

111
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,200
Gao Xi.

112
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,200
I can't operate on him.

113
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,119
My application for transferring
to another department

114
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,900
has already been forwarded
by Vice President Gao.

115
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,400
The center should have

116
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,475
a new arrangement to announce
in the next two days.

117
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:44,000
(In-patient)

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,425
I told you.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,775
I know my own physical condition.

120
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,525
I'm fine.

121
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,325
A re-check is a waste

122
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,750
of both the precious medical resources

123
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
and money,

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,525
isn't it?

125
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
Yes, yes.

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,150
We never should be too anxious.

127
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,275
To make up for you,

128
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,995
I will make soup for you today, okay?

129
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,525
Your favorite.

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
That's more like it.

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,450
And you.

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,350
Why do you two

133
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,200
have to make me suffer again?

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,975
You are the same.

135
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,650
Fine. It's all our fault.

136
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,055
Okay?

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,359
You should take advantage
of this period after surgery

138
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,359
to recover from your ulcer.

139
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,640
If we don't have the doctor
watching you,

140
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
you will smoke

141
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,625
behind me and my mother, right?

142
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,825
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:26,359
When did I smoke?

144
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,279
What I said is true.

145
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,361
I saw it.

146
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:29,480
Your mints

147
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,825
and flying chess,

148
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,450
did you hide them in the drawer?

149
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,550
I'm not stupid, okay?

150
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:38,700
I can't even eat mints now?

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,559
I saw you put them here before.

152
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,525
Did you move them?

153
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,375
No, I didn't.

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,300
Where did you put them?

155
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,825
Chapter 2…

156
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,200
Chapter 2…

157
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,725
Get up.

158
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:56,360
What?

159
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,375
Get up.

160
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,280
Why? I'm just lying here, aren't I?

161
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,625
Why do I have to get up?

162
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,450
Lin Jianguo.

163
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,450
I... I just put them here…

164
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,520
I didn't smoke, seriously.

165
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,675
- I just…
- You didn't smoke?

166
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,150
Don't you know it's harmful

167
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,475
to your stomach and the other organs?

168
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:28,520
Don't you know that?

169
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,559
I'm gonna turn this place upside down.

170
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,375
If I find one cigarette, you're dead!

171
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,350
I didn't smoke.

172
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,039
I just feel happy to see it.

173
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,400
It's just a stomach ulcer.

174
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,825
I... I didn't smoke.

175
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:41,850
What's the big deal?

176
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,919
Okay, okay.

177
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,840
Alright. Alright.

178
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,479
Have you ever listened
to me for once all these years?

179
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
If you've heard me,

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,350
how can you get this disease?

181
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,050
Tell me.

182
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,599
It's my fault. Okay?

183
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,479
Don't talk to me.

184
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,725
Alright. I really…

185
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,175
Really, I'm wrong.

186
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,719
Zhixiao.

187
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,050
What's wrong?

188
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,850
Qiuqiu.

189
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,675
I'm fine.

190
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,719
Take this lollipop.

191
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,850
Sweet food can make you feel better.

192
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,675
Okay.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,475
I'll have this.

194
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,679
Thanks, Qiuqiu.

195
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,080
What a smart boy you are!

196
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,925
You've become a Doctor of Medicine now.

197
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm okay.

198
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,875
I'm going outside for some fresh air.

199
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,450
Would you please just stay here

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,775
and play by yourself for a while?

201
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,760
Good boy.

202
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,559
Qiuqiu.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,225
- What's wrong?
- Uncle Gu.

204
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:23,650
I made a mistake.

205
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:24,925
What happened?

206
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,799
I lost my medicine.

207
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,175
I didn't dare
to tell my mother and Dr. Gao.

208
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:30,735
They'll scold me for sure.

209
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,679
Can you help me look for it?

210
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,825
Don't worry, Qiuqiu.

211
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,600
Tell me where you've been.

212
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,400
I just went to the rooftop to play.

213
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,475
Qiuqiu,
the rooftop is particularly dangerous.

214
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:43,880
You can't go there alone in the future,

215
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,799
alright?

216
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,725
I see.

217
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:47,675
I just finished my work.

218
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:48,725
I'll go find your medicine.

219
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,046
Can you go back to your ward first?

220
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,075
Okay.

221
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,236
Come on.

222
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,900
Why are you up here, Dr. Gu?

223
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,050
Qiuqiu asked me
to help him find his medicine.

224
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,975
How could his medicine be here?

225
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,075
Do you need my help?

226
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,960
No, thanks.

227
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,675
I found

228
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,475
what he has lost.

229
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,525
Were you crying?

230
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,250
No.

231
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,175
It was just the wind…

232
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:24,550
It blew something into my eyes.

233
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,640
And I've got some
excessive internal heat lately.

234
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,300
So I'm okay.

235
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:31,925
Bad mood

236
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,550
can lead to cortical dysfunction,

237
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,900
which can cause endocrine disorders.

238
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,650
Studies have found

239
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,159
that 80% of diseases

240
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,725
are related to cortical dysfunction,

241
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,450
such as hypertension,

242
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,350
cardiovascular diseases, etc.

243
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,050
So it's not a bad thing

244
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,200
for you to cry.

245
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,300
I think you do need

246
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,575
to vent properly too.

247
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,200
You must

248
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,100
have known the pathology results
earlier than us.

249
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,375
In fact, your father's stomach cancer

250
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,800
is in the middle stage.

251
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,250
As long as he cooperates
with us during the treatment,

252
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,200
he has a good chance to be cured.

253
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,425
I know.

254
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,475
The earlier the diagnosis is made,
the sooner he can get the treatment.

255
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,050
It's definitely a good thing.

256
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
It's just...

257
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,125
Listen to the music.

258
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,825
It's Johannes Brahms's

259
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,275
Double Concerto for Violin and Cello.

260
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,775
I can't believe you know music so well.

261
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,325
Beyond the title of the piece,

262
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,039
I also know

263
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,425
that this version was written

264
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,700
by the cellist Mischa Maisky
with Bernstein,

265
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,719
and the Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra

266
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,525
as well as Kramer.

267
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,150
Mischa Maisky?

268
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,725
He's a legendary musician.

269
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,475
I love him so much.

270
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,275
He was born in wartime

271
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,400
and went through
the turmoil and hardships.

272
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:20,925
Even so,

273
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,025
he never gave up his dream of music.

274
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,919
He is one

275
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,750
of my favorite cellists.

276
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,875
Whenever I encountered difficulties

277
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,325
and challenges,

278
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,250
the first man
who came to my head is him.

279
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,650
I wanna be like him

280
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,475
when I face the challenges
and setbacks in life.

281
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,775
You know quite a lot.

282
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,559
Of course.

283
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,550
I'm a junior in the music department,

284
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,640
okay?

285
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,919
Although

286
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,475
it may be a little hard for you to tell…

287
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,599
This hospital is practicing MDT,

288
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,900
which stands
for Multi-Disciplinary Treatment.

289
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,150
Oh.

290
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,250
But I don't quite understand.

291
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,465
In simple terms, it means that doctors

292
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:33,159
of various specialties,
such as medicine and surgery,

293
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,679
work together to customize
a medical plan

294
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,800
for a patient.

295
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,400
This is the surgeon

296
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,475
who will operate on Mr. Lin Jianguo.

297
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:41,964
Dr. Yan Bingjun.

298
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:43,359
- Hello, Dr. Yan.
- Hi.

299
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,559
Let's get right to the point.

300
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,100
Lin Jianguo's tumor

301
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,379
is located

302
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,119
in the lesser curvature of the stomach.

303
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,850
In this case,

304
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,410
we recommend

305
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,500
radical total gastrectomy,

306
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,799
which in layman's terms,

307
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,975
is to cut out the whole stomach.

308
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,359
W-What?

309
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:03,850
Cut out his whole stomach?

310
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,040
Here's the thing.

311
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,560
Mr. Lin's tumor

312
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,575
is in a special location.

313
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:09,200
And the ulcer area is relatively large.

314
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,250
The most critical problem is

315
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,925
that his cancer might be worse

316
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,700
than what the gastroscopy showed.

317
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,839
So,

318
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,325
total gastrectomy is the safest way.

319
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,760
My mom is kind of overwhelmed right now.

320
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,875
Sorry, Dr. Yan.

321
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
Look.

322
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,500
I did some research on the internet.

323
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,225
In similar cases like this,

324
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,225
Dr. Gu seemed

325
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:50,239
to have used

326
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,625
the distal gastrectomy

327
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,550
preserving half

328
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,050
of the patient's stomach.

329
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,150
Dr. Gu?

330
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah.

331
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:01,680
Dr.-Dr. Gu?

332
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,725
You mean Gu Wei?

333
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,425
Yeah. Gu Wei.

334
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,925
Listen.

335
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,700
No matter what Dr. Gu thinks,

336
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,280
I have my own medical philosophy.

337
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,880
For patients,

338
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,275
eliminating all possible risks
of post-operative recurrence,

339
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,650
in my view,

340
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,040
should always be the top priority.

341
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,119
So, Dr. Yan,

342
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,959
you're saying

343
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,400
that as long as this surgery is done,

344
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,520
my father's disease won't recur

345
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,560
in the future,

346
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,000
right?

347
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,319
That's not what I meant.

348
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,880
No one

349
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,479
can be 100% sure

350
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,800
that the disease won't come back
after an operation.

351
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,079
We, as doctors,

352
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,359
are just saying that we'll try our best

353
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,079
to minimize the probability
of its recurrence.

354
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:44,880
Right.

355
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,400
Okay, I understand.

356
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,119
What about this?

357
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
This is the consent form for surgery.

358
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,800
Take a look at it.

359
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,950
Mr. Lin's surgery

360
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,231
is scheduled for…

361
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,350
Next week.

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,719
Next week. You still have time.

363
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,425
You still have time to think it over.

364
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,050
If you have any questions,
feel free to tell me at any time.

365
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,986
I have surgery to do.

366
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,079
I gotta go get ready.

367
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,239
- Okay. Thank you, Dr. Yan.
- It's nothing.

368
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,160
- Thank you. Thank you.
- It's okay.

369
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,400
If you have any follow-up questions,

370
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,920
you can keep asking Dr. Gao.

371
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,425
Okay.

372
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:14,441
- Okay.
- Okay.

373
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,400
Have a seat.

374
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,075
Excuse me, Dr. Gao.

375
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,125
As I said before, as his daughter,

376
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,680
I hope that my father

377
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,125
can live a quality life.

378
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:24,725
Mm.

379
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,075
So this surgery...

380
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,725
Can I ask Dr. Gu to do it for us?

381
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,199
Yes, yes.

382
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,425
Dr. Gu was the one

383
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,025
who found my husband's cancer.

384
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,640
We trust him a lot.

385
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,025
I understand what you mean.

386
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,475
But...

387
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,400
This may disappoint you,

388
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,450
but Dr. Gu is…

389
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,225
Or maybe you can go talk to him,
as the family members of the patient…

390
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,225
Look.

391
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,880
Dr. Gu Wei

392
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,040
is indeed

393
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,925
one of the greatest surgeons
in our hospital.

394
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,625
I support your idea.

395
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,950
Go and talk to him.

396
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,079
As long as he agrees,

397
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:14,950
there won't be any problem.

398
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,200
Okay, okay.

399
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,880
Okay, okay.

400
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,839
Thank you, Dr. Gao.

401
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,560
By the way,

402
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,880
Dr. Gu is usually occupied.

403
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,775
I suggest you do something

404
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,875
to convince him.

405
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,839
- Okay, we understand.
- We understand.

406
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,100
Okay, then.

407
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,141
We'll leave…

408
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,560
- We'll leave it here for now.
- Okay.

409
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
We'll come back
after discussing with Dr. Gu.

410
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,199
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Dr. Gao.

411
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,575
Bye, Dr. Gao.

412
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,479
I'm going back to the ward
to stay with your father,

413
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,760
or he'll get suspicious.

414
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,400
You

415
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,700
go to the mall right now

416
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,900
to buy something for me.

417
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,800
I'll give you 2,000 yuan.

418
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,050
What for?

419
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,439
Buy something,

420
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:55,880
and give it to Dr. Gu.

421
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,150
Why?

422
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,439
Don't ask.

423
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,880
One, two, three, four, five.

424
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,725
Here.

425
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,900
Take it.

426
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,605
Did you not hear what Dr. Gao just said?

427
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,599
"Do something".

428
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,450
For "Do something",

429
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,025
she means we should be respectful
and grateful

430
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:11,944
when talking to Dr. Gu.

431
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,675
Did you take this the wrong way?

432
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,825
You're too naive.

433
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:17,104
That's a social protocol.

434
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,680
Just listen to me.

435
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,850
Go buy a gift

436
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,675
and gave it to him,

437
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:21,425
understand?

438
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,625
Okay.

439
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,959
Your father's surgery
is the first priority!

440
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:24,839
Don't dilly-dally here.

441
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,100
What are you dawdling about?
Come on, go!

442
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,200
- I'll go then.
- Come on!

443
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,850
Run!

444
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,075
Lin Zhixiao.

445
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,425
You've been following me.
Is something wrong?

446
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,239
Dr. Gu.

447
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,599
I'm serious.

448
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,760
You are the most trusted doctor

449
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,239
by our family now.

450
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,500
We earnestly expect

451
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,750
you to operate

452
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,949
on Mr. Lin.

453
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,800
Miss Lin.

454
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,000
Your father's surgeon is Dr. Yan.

455
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,959
So I suggest you

456
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,500
discuss with him if you have anything.

457
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,920
I understand. I understand.

458
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,400
Dr. Yan is a nice person.

459
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,575
But Dr. Yan said

460
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:15,600
if he operates on Mr. Lin,

461
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,520
he will cut off Mr. Lin's stomach.

462
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,160
Well, Dr. Gu,

463
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,760
I want to know if there is

464
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,100
- any other surgical plans…
- Surgical plan.

465
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
I just said

466
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,125
I suggest you discuss this with Dr. Yan.

467
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,875
Well...

468
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,500
Wh-What about you?

469
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,140
Why can't you do it?

470
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,700
Personal reasons.

471
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,000
Got it.

472
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,425
Dr. Gao told me

473
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,225
I have to be sincere.

474
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,500
Fruits are rich in vitamins.

475
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,640
People like you

476
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,350
should eat more oranges.

477
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,025
Wait a minute.
I'll wash them for you right away.

478
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,050
No, I'm fine.

479
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,600
Don't like fruits?

480
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,425
It's all right.

481
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,066
Something better is coming.

482
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,719
Dr. Gu.

483
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,800
I believe

484
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,199
doctors like you are

485
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,320
exhausted, aren't you?

486
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,280
Isn't that how it feels?

487
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,100
I know that.

488
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,780
Before my college entrance exam,

489
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,325
I couldn't sleep.

490
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,725
I felt anxious. I lost my hair.

491
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,025
I lost a lot of hair.

492
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,719
But I used this.

493
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:19,200
(Anti-hair loss shampoo set)
No more hair loss troubles.

494
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,439
This is amazing.

495
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,500
It's imported from abroad.

496
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,079
If you buy this set,

497
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,400
you can get hair growth essence
for free.

498
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,500
I'm not lying to you.

499
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,275
When I'm done with this,

500
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,575
my hairline is growing back.

501
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,250
No, but I didn't mean

502
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,575
your hairline

503
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:34,800
is probably retreating.

504
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,194
I just thought you could

505
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:37,425
prevent it before it happens.

506
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:38,175
Am I right?

507
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,800
You don't seem to like this very much.

508
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,275
It's okay.

509
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:46,975
I got a better one.

510
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,100

Have you ever got the feeling

512
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,520
that your body is depleting?

513
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,640
As doctors,

514
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,100
you always operate, consult
and see patients.

No matter of energy
or physical strength,

516
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:01,199
you can't keep up. I understand.

517
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:03,400
I checked this online.

518
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,920
This thing

519
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:07,400
is nutritious.

520
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,040
Especially it is good

523
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,550
Go for it, Dr. Gu.

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Miss Lin, I'm busy.

525
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,575
There is a consultation this afternoon.

About the surgery,

527
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,920
I suggest you talk to Dr. Yan.

528
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
I appreciate your kindness.

529
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,600
I think we just had…

530
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,071
a pleasant conversation.

532
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,610
What's the matter?

533
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,450
Was there something wrong?

534
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,490
Dr. Gu.

535
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:52,025
This thing works really well.

536
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,900
Got it. Got it.

537
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,719
Dr. Gu,

538
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,050
I have nothing else to do.

539
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,150
I just want to tell you

540
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,475
I'll be waiting for you at the door.

541
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,825
Bye.

542

You go back first.

Let me ask him.

547
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,950
All right. Thank you, Dr. Gao.

548
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:49,575
Lin Zhixiao, didn't I tell you...

552
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,075
is there really no room for discussion?

Okay, I won't talk to you.

you'd better go to one of the top labs
in the country.

562
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,350
I'll go with you.

563
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,950
How come I never knew

564
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,700
you have a scholarly plan?

565
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,950
Not before.

566
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,825
But for you,

567
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,175
I'd like to go with you.

568
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,199
Sorry, I didn't see anything.

569
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:50,880
Lin Zhixiao!

570
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,300
Come on in.

571
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,400
Didn't you just say

572
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,750
you have something to talk to me?

573
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,550
Now let's have a good chat.

574
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,800
Gu Wei.

575
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,599
Come on in.

576
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,250
Dr. Gao, I'm sorry.

577
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,350
I've got business
to talk about with Lin Zhixiao.

578
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,825
You go where you're needed.

579
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,100
I'm not finished yet.

580
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,625
Sit down.

581
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,550
Sorry about that.

582
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,750
But...

583
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,775
I want you to think about it.

584
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,575
Ex-girlfriend?

585
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,225
For couples like you,

586
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:47,800
I've seen too many at school.

587
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,325
You love each other.

588
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,760
But you broke up in the end.

589
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,500
She wants to get back together,
but you don't.

590
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,300
You want to abuse her again, don't you?

591
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,520
Very imaginative.

592
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,325
Wrong?

593
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,079
So she likes you.

594
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,900
But you don't like her.

595
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,175
If this is not the case...

596
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,599
Could it be that you two are
in a secret relationship?

597
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,475
But you like...

598
00:28:07,475 --> 00:28:08,275
Stop! Stop! Stop!

599
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,450
You can go now.

600
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,311
No way, Dr. Gu.

601
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:16,125
You're so cruel.

602
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,950
You just took advantage of me.

603
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,375
Thank you.

604
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,475
You can go now.

605
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,000
Dr. Gu,

606
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,250
about Mr. Lin's surgery,

607
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,700
if we don't make it clear today,

608
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,750

609
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,700
Don't keep prevaricating me

610
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,100
by saying it's because

611
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,860
of your personal reasons.

612
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,325
Or is it because you don't like

613
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:40,405
the gifts I bought you?

614
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,839
So what do you like?

615
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,025
Just tell me.

616
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,125
I'll just buy it for you, alright?

617
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:49,990
You see, it's like this.

618
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,225
I really like

619
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,900
the gifts you bought for me.

620
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,275

621

wash an orange for me?

622
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,150
So simple?

623
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,800
Yeah, it's that simple.

624
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:02,925
Are you sure?

625
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,775
Yeah.

626
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,500
Okay, wait a moment.

627
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,750
I'll wash you an orange

628
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,175
Mm, go ahead.

629
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,750
Be right back.

633
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,920
I want to talk to you

634
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,025
about the possibility
of distal gastrectomy

Dr. Gu.

639
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,150
Fine. Gu Wei.

640
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,675
Yesterday, I looked through

641
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,850
Lin Jianguo's gastroscopy report.

642
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,650
I found that
given the location of his tumor,

643
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,700
we can consider not
having his stomach removed

644
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,175
Just make one...

645
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,280
You go ahead. I'm listening.

646
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,225
Dr. Yan.

647
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,025
I think we should save people

648
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,399
for the sake of their survival and life.

649
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,725
With Lin Jianguo's current situation,

650
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,690
the distal gastrectomy

651
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,775
can give him better access to nutrition.

652
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,719
Maybe it's better for him.

653
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,550
You said it yourself.

654
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,475
This

655
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,500
is your idea.

656
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,650
It's not mine.

657
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,675
Besides,

658
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:29,640
the surgeon of Lin Jianguo

659
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,959
is me now.

660
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,719
I'm not willing to take that risk.

661
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:33,675
Neither will I

662
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:35,680
put my patient at risk.

663
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,121
Actually, these two plans

664
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:38,400
are both risky.

665
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,100
It's just that I think
a distal gastrectomy

666
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,518
is more suitable for Lin Jianguo.

667
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:42,439
All right, all right.

668
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:43,520
Our argument is

669
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:44,725
useless.

670
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,300
You have your thoughts.

671
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,100
I have my principles.

672
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,200
Well, if you insist on

673
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,100
keeping Lin Jianguo's stomach,

674
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,400
you can operate

675
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,839
on him.

676
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,225
What do you think I can do?

677
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,325
I have only one choice now.

678
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:26,325
That's to let Dr. Gu operate on Mr. Lin.

679
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,800
But Dr. Gu is not willing to do it.

680
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:31,626
It's not right.

681
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,375
I remember you said

682
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,750
Dr. Gu is just a pretty boy.

683
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,200
And he is a jinx.

684
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,475
You've changed your attitude

685
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:42,610
towards him so soon.

686
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Come on.

687
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,925
Did you hear what I told you?

688
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,775
Thanks to Dr. Gu,

689
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:50,675
Mr. Lin's illness is confirmed at last.

690
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,825
Strictly speaking,

691
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,300
Dr. Gu is kind of Mr. Lin's

692
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,381
lifesaver.

693
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,280
And at present,

694
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,680
Mr. Lin can only retain

695
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,150
more tissue in his stomach

696
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,870
if Dr. Gu operates on him.

697
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,975
Do you really think he is reliable?

698
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:05,625
Mm.

699
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,250
He didn't get promoted through nepotism?

700
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,525
He's not a quack
with a medical accident?

701
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,680
Well...

702
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,900
That's because
I didn't investigate before.

703
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,125
I didn't know.

704
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,364
But now I know.

705
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:18,556
He's definitely not like that.

706
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,300
Then beg him

707
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,925
to operate on Mr. Lin.

708
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:23,200
I begged him.

709
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,519
I tried to persuade him.

710
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,525
I even bought him gifts.

711
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,625
But he didn't accept anything.

712
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,300
What did you give him?

713
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,325
I gave him…

714
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,250

715
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:35,275

Don't you know what on earth

722
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,725
you gave him?

723
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,800
What?

724
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,075

00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,560
What's the matter?

750
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,650
I was wrong.

751
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,399
That day,

752
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,800
I didn't know clearly…

753
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,575
If you

754
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:04,900
are still not creative like this,

755
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,525
I advise you to stop.

756
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,650
(I've done a lot of wrongs.)

757
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,387
(I can't read your mind.)

758
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,225
(I don't know what you think
of our relationship.)

759
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:31,825
(I will always like you until…)

760
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:34,006
(old me old you)

761
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,950
Are you paying tribute

762
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:39,520
to Love Actually?

763
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,700
It doesn't matter what I pay tribute to.

764
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:47,040
Don't you answer it?

765
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,750
She is not important.

766
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,750
My priority

767
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,990
is you now.

768
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,360
If I create inconveniences,

769
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,040
I can give you a minute.

770
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,200
No, no, no.

771
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,840
You didn't.

772
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:57,919
It's very convenient.

773
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,050
Nothing inconvenient.

774
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,250
It's just a video call.

775
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,000
You can just watch it right here.

776
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,250
Hello.

777
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,000
Gu Xiao.

778
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,875
When are you coming to see me?

779
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:12,520
I...

780
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,400
What are you doing, Gu Xiao?

781
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:15,750
Gu Xiao.

782
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,950
- Gu Xiao.
- Bye.

783
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,975
Why didn't you call me?

784
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:21,725
Call me.

785
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,040
Gu Xiao, what are you doing?

786
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,159
I have some proper business to do now.

787
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,900
I will call you later.

788
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,625
Bye.

789
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,425
Lin Zhixiao.

790
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,575
Dr. Gu, I've been waiting for you.

791
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,700
What are you doing here?

792
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,875
I'm here...

793
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,675
I... I...

794
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:54,550
I was just waiting for you
in your office.

795
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,875
I noticed you weren't there,

796
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,474
so I have to wait for you here.

797
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,625
I'm dining out.

798
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,025
You can come with me.

799
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:07,719
(Doctor's Lounge)

800
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,700
Okay!

801
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,375
Dr. Gu, let me treat you.

802
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:24,500
Sansan, emergency!

803
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,075
I need to find a restaurant
nearby the hospital

804
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:28,300
to treat Dr. Gu.

805
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,750
A high-end one.
Quickly recommend me one.

806
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

807
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,479
(If time could stop at the moment)
Only the two of you?

808
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:39,479
(when we first met)
Yeah, I made an appointment.

809
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,925
- Okay, this way, please.
- Ms. Lin.

810
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,125
Is this place good?

811
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,675
- Yeah, it's delicious. Trust me.
- This way.

812
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,650
Here.

813
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,530
Thank you.

814
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,625
Is this the seat we reserved?

815
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,375
Yes, it is.

816
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,825
Thank you.

817
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,650
This is our menu.

818
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,479
Thank you.

819
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,175
Today is Couple Theme Day.

820
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,675
Couple Theme Day?

821
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,125
I'm sorry, I-I don't know

822
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,446
today is a special...

823
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,639
We have three packages.

824
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,850
For 288 yuan,

825
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,700
388 yuan

826
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,800
and 588 yuan respectively.

827
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,439
Which one would you like?

828
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:29,175
Talk to me. Talk to me. It's my treat.

829
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:31,800
Got it.

830
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,439
Looks like your girlfriend's
in charge of the money.

831
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:35,950
No, no, no.

832
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,831
No, no, no.

833
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:37,800
Just...

834
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,075
What kind of package do you want?

835
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,275
In our 588 yuan package,

836
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:44,360
there is an upgraded dessert,

837
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,560
heart-shaped tiramisu.

838
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,120
Its name is Devotion.

839
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,400
It has a good meaning.

840
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,720
Would you like to try it?

841
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:51,525
No, it's okay. It's okay.

842
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:52,800
I'll choose myself.

843
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,425
We'll have a 288 yuan package.

844
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,280
Thank you.

845
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,525
Okay, just a minute.

846
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,120
Lin Zhixiao,

847
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,425
I thought you were looking for me

848
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:16,025
because you want to ask about
your father's surgical plan.

849
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,525
Looks like now

850
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:19,625
there's something even harder to say.

851
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,475
Lin Zhixiao.

852
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:23,800
Well…

853
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,719
You can't really be

854
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,025
looking for a date.

855
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,040
No, no, Dr. Gu.

856
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,159
Don't get me wrong.

857
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,450
I didn't mean that.

858
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,875
I just...

859
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,186
It's...

860
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,100
not easy to ask.

861
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,000
But

862
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,025
I still have to ask.

863
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,425
It's...

864
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,080
Dr. Gu,

865
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,650
please operate on my father.

866
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,025
Thank you.

867
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,375
Wei, you're not home yet.

868
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,639
Du, you're just in time.

869
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,399
Come here.

870
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,000
Okay.

871
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,600
Handle this as usual.

872
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:27,150
After the patient's family do this,

873
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,670
they will feel at ease.

874
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,200
Who sent it this time?

875
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,400
Lin Zhixiao.

876
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,425
Lin Zhixiao?

877
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:34,161
Yeah.

878
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,450
She gave you a red envelope.

879
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,959
Does that mean you're not leaving

880
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,625
and you're going to operate
on Lin Jianguo?

881
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:42,520
She's not asking me to do my best
in surgery.

882
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,075
But she misunderstood me

883
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:45,425
because I don't want to
operate on her father.

884
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:47,950
It's okay.

885
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,450
Anyway, in two days,

886
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,050
my transfer application
will be approved.

887
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,275
That one.

888
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,150
Does it hurt?

889
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:21,025
It's okay.

890
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
I have paid the bills.

891
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:28,725
Mm.

892
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,760
Zhixiao.

893
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,120
Why don't you go get me something?

894
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,760
Come out and I'll tell you
how to get there.

895
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,500
It's alright.

896
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,150
What's the matter, Ms. Li?

897
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,350
The red envelope is returned.

898
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,525
Red envelope?

899
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,175
Red envelope for Dr. Gu?

900
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:50,959
I went to pick up your dad's medicine.

901
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,200
When I was paying,

902
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,275
I found out that there is more money
in the card.

903
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:56,050
It is just the amount
of the red envelope.

904
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,490
If it wasn't him, who could it be?

905
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:00,500
Dr. Gu returned the red envelope.

906
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,150
Do you think he thinks we paid less?

907
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,900
Or are there other reasons?

908
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,000
Who knows?

909
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:09,159
I think he's made up his mind

910
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:10,725
not to operate on your dad.

911
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,825
Come on, Ms. Li.

912
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,025
Don't worry about it.

913
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:15,850
I'll convince him.

914
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,479
What can you do?

915
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:19,280
No worries.

916
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,875
I'll take care of it, okay?

917
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:23,825
