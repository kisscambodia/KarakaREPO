=Episode 7=

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,720
I am going to start a business,

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,440
and

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,425
I get the start-up capital ready.

21
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,275
I need talent.

22
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,400
What do you say?

23
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:42,879
Are you interested in

24
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,120
doing something big with me?

25
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,300
What project?

26
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,500
A bar.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,750
A bar?

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,525
Do you have a license
to operate alcoholic beverages?

29
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,000
Do you know the high risk
of nightclub business?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,601
Do you know how to run a bar?

31
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,239
I don't, but I can learn.

32
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,440
You? Forget about it.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,850
I knew you were unreliable.

34
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,919
You tell me.

35
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,200
What should I do?

36
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:14,936
A café.

37
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,839
A café is too boring.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,200
Bars are fun.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,125
Bars are full of pretty women.

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,850
I think you want to open a bar,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,360
so you can take advantage of
the opportunity to drink and pick up girls.

42
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,080
Cafés are full of businessmen.

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,525
I think you just want to have a place

44
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:34,900
to be a gold-digger.

45
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,850
Wait…

46
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,275
I have an appointment. I'm leaving now.

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,375
Café it is!

48
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,700
You can be the manager, OK?

49
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:52,720
Bye-bye.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,425
Hello, Dad?

51
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:27,525
Who…

52
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,839
Who says I can't get a job?

53
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,839
I've already received a lot of offers.

54
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,825
I'm telling you,

55
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:35,700
I pick the jobs now,

56
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,060
not the other way around.

57
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,100
Don't send me money!

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,825
I didn't go to school abroad

59
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:48,119
for nothing, OK?

60
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,550
I have skills, OK?

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Don't worry.

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
I can take care of myself,

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
absolutely no problem.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,525
I know what's going on

65
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,725
at home, OK?

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I know our business is not doing well.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,325
It's okay. I'm fine.

68
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,839
OK, I have to go.

69
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,825
I'm going to take a shower. Bye.

70
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,000
Cheers.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,679
Cheers. Cheers.

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,775
How do you say it in your hometown?

73
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,975
Say what?

74
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:25,000
I like you.

75
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,200
I.

76
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,160
I.

77
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Like.

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,720
Like.

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,399
You.

80
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,239
You.

81
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,000
You.

82
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,359
Put them together.

83
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,679
I like you.

84
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,559
I like…

85
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,399
- Slowly.
- You try it.

86
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,160
Let's try it slowly.

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,525
- Slower.
- I'll try. I like you.

88
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:43,550
Who is this? It's late already.

89
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,700
I need to take this call.

90
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,325
Hello, Sansan.

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,799
Sansan.

92
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,025
Are you really going to open a café?

93
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,700
Of course!

94
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,399
- I'm ready to hire now,
- Come on, cheers.

95
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,675
I'm reviewing resumes.

96
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:04,975
Good.

97
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,720
You set a time for an interview.

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,825
I will get my resume ready.

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,359
No need.

100
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,600
I trust you.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
If you come,

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,640
you'll be the manager.

103
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,575
OK?

104
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,760
Let's discuss
the cooperation model tomorrow.

105
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,950
I want to be a shareholder
with technology contributed.

106
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,119
And

107
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,359
we need to discuss

108
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,225
the management model and business style.

109
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,440
No problem. See you tomorrow.

110
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,400
See you tomorrow.

111
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,519
So unreliable.

112
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,275
Let me ask you something serious.

113
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,679
Do any of your families own a café

114
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:38,775
or have you done it yourselves?

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,700
What's she talking about?

116
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,880
A shareholder
with technology contributed,

117
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,400
management model and business style,

118
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,601
what are these?

119
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:45,575
Xiao,

120
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,679
café is boring.

121
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,200
You're wrong.

122
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,425
Is he doing this for a café?

123
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,925
You got me. Cheers.

124
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,686
- Come on, cheers.
- Here, here.

125
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,425
Keep an eye on the patient.

126
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,650
- Yes, okay.
- If anything happens,

127
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,279
report it to me immediately.

128
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:02,875
Okay.

129
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,760
Hi, Dr. Gu.

130
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,850
You're done with your rounds?

131
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,359
Get back to work.

132
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,300
Sure.

133
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,075
Would you like

134
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,625
to join me?

135
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,925
Yes.

136
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:26,125
Let's go.

137
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,100
Here, Dr. Gu.

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
To celebrate the success

139
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,775
of Lin Zhixiao's cellist contest,

140
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,075
cheers!

141
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,475
You really like this so much?

142
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,839
You should drink Coke

143
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,175
on such a good day.

144
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,450
It's a ritual.

145
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,175
Do you doctors do not drink this?

146
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,975
Some doctors like to

147
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,040
drink a little Coke

148
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,000
after multiple surgeries

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,050
to get a quick sugar boost.

150
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,175
Right?

151
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,600
I owe my success

152
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,750
in the contest to you.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
You help Mr. Lin a lot.

154
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,351
I've been saying thank you a lot,

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,550
but I want to say thank you again today.

156
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,625
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

157
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,679
You're a very uninteresting person.

158
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,400
You're always acting cool.

159
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,925
We've been talking to each other.

160
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,245
We are friends, right?

161
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,850
Dr. Gu sounds strange,

162
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,925
can I call you something else?

163
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,840
Like…

164
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,550
Like what?

165
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,775
Dr. Handsome?

166
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:48,825
This is…

167
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:50,160
This name is a bit flirty.

168
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,625
Not good enough. Another one.

169
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,559
Like…

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Dr. Old-school.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,559
It suits you.

172
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,825
What? You like it?

173
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,720
What kind of name is it?

174
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
You don't like it?

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,050
Lin Zhixiao.

176
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,025
Mr. Lin is coming back for chemotherapy.

177
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,040
Does it seem appropriate that

178
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,119
you are offending
his attending physician?

179
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,750
No, not at all.

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm just kidding.

181
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,925
I'll call you Dr. Gu.

182
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,160
Dr. Gu?

183
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,875
Yes.

184
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:23,900
Do you think I'm not reliable?

185
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,650
Actually,

186
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,171
I'm not that bad.

187
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,100
I owe you a song. I remember it.

188
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,575
When I get the tickets for the Concert,

189
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:32,725
I'll give you one,

190
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:33,750
and invite you to listen to it.

191
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,075
Uh-huh.

192
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,700
I'm looking forward to it.

193
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:38,900
Uh-huh.

194
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,875
Want some chips?

195
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,450
It's delicious.

196
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
You're so funny!

197
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,359
Why do you do that all the time?

198
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,875
Do you think

199
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,080
this is cool?

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,159
Let me tell you something.

201
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,300
It's so lame.

202
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:09,400
(Doctor's Office 2)

203
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,200
Gu Wei.

204
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,100
Du.

205
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,239
Dr. Gao.

206
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,050
Come here.

207
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,700
Where's Gu Wei?

208
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,239
Did he leave from work?

209
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,100
The family of the patient in bed 9,

210
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,660
Ms. Lin, wanted to see him.

211
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440
Bed 9? What's wrong with bed 9?

212
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,575
Nothing.

213
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:34,925
But something is going on with them.

214
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,475
What?

215
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,625
I didn't say anything.

216
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,750
He should be back soon.

217
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,850
Mr. Lin, Ms. Li.

218
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,825
My first step on the road to greatness

219
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,226
is about to begin,

220
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,575
the cellist of the Concert.

221
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,440
Tickets for friends and family.

222
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,280
I just got them.

223
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,250
Let me see.

224
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,175
Am I good?

225
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,640
You are so easily satisfied.

226
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,239
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,119
I think my daughter is very good.

228
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,280
When is it?

229
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,500
The first of next month.

230
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,239
I don't know how well

231
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,559
your father will recover by then.

232
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,159
Maybe we won't be able to go.

233
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,100
What are you talking about?

234
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,640
I must be there.

235
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Lin Zhixiao.

236
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,075
Don't embarrass me.

237
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,400
Alright, Mr. Lin.

238
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
You need more rest.

239
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,250
There will be many opportunities

240
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,250
for me to be a cellist,

241
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,799
I will invite you to be there
every day, okay?

242
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,125
I promise I'll make you proud.

243
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,100
Okay, I'll wait for the grand theater.

244
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,375
Okay.

245
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,440
How's it going?

246
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,320
Dr. Gao

247
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,559
Good. Good.

248
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,000
The wound doesn't seem to hurt so much.

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,675
right?

250
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,359
You can try to move around more.

251
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,000
Sure.

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,725
Good.

253
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,325
Dr. Gao.

254
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:51,025
Dr. Gao.

255
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,359
We didn't have time to

256
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,640
thank you

257
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,280
after the operation.

258
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,125
I have a concert next month

259
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,404
and would like to invite you to see it.

260
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,750
Thank you for

261
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,070
taking care of Lin.

262
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
Dr. Gao, I'm sorry.

263
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,239
Lin Zhixiao and I need
to talk about work.

264
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,050
You go ahead.

265
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,960
I want to run for the cellist

266
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,159
in our school's concert.

267
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,640
But I haven't practiced for a long time,

268
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,800
so I don't know if I can succeed.

269
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,825
I can help you with that.

270
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,050
See you in the hospital lobby
tomorrow morning.

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,625
Dr. Gao.

272
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,679
Dr. Gao?

273
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,440
So, did you invite Gu Wei?

274
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
I did.

275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,375
I'll give him the tickets later.

276
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,125
Why don't you give me the tickets.

277
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,125
I'm on my way to see him.

278
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,900
Sure.

279
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,075
Thank you.

280
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,960
The first of next month?

281
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600
That's right.

282
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,599
Gu Wei and I have a seminar that day,

283
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,275
so we might not be able to make it.

284
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,850
But we'll try to be there.

285
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,850
Okay, thank you, Dr. Gao.

286
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,350
Rest well.

287
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,559
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

288
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,700
Bye, Dr. Gao.

289
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,650
If you don't have a place

290
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,239
to send these tickets,
I'll give them to my colleague.

291
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,840
A lot of people want them, okay,

292
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,925

293
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:05,875
I'm on fire, okay?

294
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,159
Okay, okay, okay.

295
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,075
I can't believe you.

296
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,700
What are you doing?

297
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,925

300
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,125
and the participants are professionals,

301
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,445
so I'd like to invite you to join us.

302
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,075
Uh-huh.

303
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,250
If the department doesn't
have any plans,

304
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,250
I'll definitely go.

305
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,925
Then we'll go together.

309
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,425
When I get the tickets for the Concert,

310
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:54,525

00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,650
after you leave, OK?

379
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,165
Then I won't

380
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:29,159
be able to see you anymore.

381
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,359
How come?

382
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,679
We just hope that

383
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,919
when we see you again,

384
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,200
you won't be in the hospital.

385
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,750
But if you miss us,

386
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,150
we will visit you, okay?

387
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,320
There's one last piece.

388
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,039
Look who doesn't have one yet.

389
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,840
Give a piece to Dr. Gao.

390
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,000
Dr. Gao.

391
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,359
Would you like a piece of cake?

392
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,119
Thank you, Qiuqiu.

393
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,575
I thought I wouldn't get one.

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,350
You have to eat less sweets

395
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,900
and oily things in the future, you know?

396
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,679
Just take one or two bites of this,

397
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,850
don't eat it all.

398
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,770
Dr. Gao is quite right,

399
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,479
but that's for later.

400
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,100
- Today is an exception.
- Gu Wei!

401
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,175
I approved it today.

402
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,320
You can eat. Go.

403
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,775
Come on, Qiuqiu.

404
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:10,075
- Dr. Gu said you can eat cake now.
- It's OK.

405
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,195
Come on, have some more.

406
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,400
Here. Enjoy the cake.

407
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,850
Cake time.

408
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,325
Use this.

409
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,280
Dr. Gu is still

410
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,400
a neat freak.

411
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm exactly the same as Gu Wei.

412
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,100
It's just a professional habit.

413
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,750
Not really.

414
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,725
I can use disposable ones.

415
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,300
Oh, Gu Wei.

416
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,875
This piece it too big.

417
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,150
I can't eat it all. It's a waste.

418
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,275
Let's share it.

419
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,275
I don't want to waste it.

420
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,475
I should share Qiuqiu's piece.

421
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,475
It's not good for him to eat that much.

422
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:50,950
Sure.

423
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:53,425
- Come on, Qiuqiu.
- Dr. Gu and Dr. Gao are so close.

424
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,950
I've known him for such a long time.

425
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,375
We know each other's flavor.

426
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,475
Of course.

427
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,200
Alright, let's enjoy the cake.

428
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,199
OK.

429
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,680
Enjoy yourselves.

430
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,200
Qiuqiu, is it good?

431
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,950
Which one is better?

432
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,599
Yours is better.

433
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,675
No way.

434
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:18,625
Bye-bye.

435
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,400
Gu Wei.

436
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,375
That cake was a bit greasy.

437
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,040
Would you some black tea?

438
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,050
No, thanks.

439
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,550
Dr. Gao.

440
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,250
I have things to do.

441
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,650
Don't wait for me.

442
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,950
OK.

443
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,425
What is it, Qiuqiu?

444
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,479
Dr. Gu.

445
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,125
I know your secret.

446
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Really?

447
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,275
That's big.

448
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,025
What secret? Tell me.

449
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,675
You like Zhixiao.

450
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,050
Nonsense.

451
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,160
Who told you that?

452
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,350
Do you know what it means
to like someone?

453
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:07,705
Of course I do.

454
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,000
You didn't smile before,

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,325
but since Zhixiao came,

456
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,975
you've been smiling at her a lot.

457
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,350
Qiuqiu, we should go.

458
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,050
Dr. Gu, I'm going to get us ready.

459
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,719
We'll leave soon.

460
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:22,880
I'll walk you out later.

461
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Thank you.

462
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,350
Come with me, Qiuqiu.

463
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,975
Thank you.

464
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:28,077
Bye.

465
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,950
(In-patient)

466
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,575
Thank you.

467
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,795
Qiuqiu,

468
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,500
Aunt Li

469
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,560
is busy taking care of Grandpa Lin,

470
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,025
so I'm here on behalf of them

471
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,100
to say goodbye to you, OK?

472
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,800
Thank you, Zhixiao.

473
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't want to say goodbye to you

474
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,560
and Dr. Gu.

475
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,925
I don't want to leave you either.

476
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,500
Here, this is a gift

477
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,200
from Grandpa
Lin, Aunt Li

478
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,250
and me.

479
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,575
If you miss me,

480
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,896
just look at this, OK?

481
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,640
Zhixiao,

482
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,550
How can I play with a bear doll?

483
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,825
OK, OK, OK.

484
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,025
Would you

485
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,425
take care of this bear

486
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:17,079
for me?

487
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:17,925
OK.

488
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,941
Good boy.

489
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,325
Qiuqiu.

490
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,875
After discharge from the hospital,
you should eat less snacks,

491
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,550
rest well and take care of yourself,

492
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,325
understand?

493
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,550
Here, this is for you.

494
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:32,500
Book of Healthy

495
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,600
and Study.

496
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,300
Uh-huh.

497
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,675
Dr. Gu's gift

498
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,000
is worse than Zhixiao's.

499
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,160
You take it.

500
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,359
Don't be rude.

501
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,650
Say thank you to Dr. Gu.

502
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,375
I have gifts

503
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,640
for Dr. Gu and Zhixiao.

504
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,375
Really? What gifts?

505
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,900
- Help me.
- Let me help you.

506
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,400
Zhixiao, this is for you.

507
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,240
This one?

508
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:05,425
Thank you, Qiuqiu.

509
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:07,000
And Dr. Gu.

510
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,599
This is for you.

511
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,839
Thank you, Qiuqiu.

512
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,050
What is it?

513
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,119
Don't open it now.

514
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,825
Wait after I leave.

515
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,425
Don't tell the others.

516
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
This is a little secret.

517
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,825
Uh-huh.

518
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:21,350
OK, we won't open it now.

519
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,750
Dr. Gu.

520
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,425
Thank you.

521
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,400
Sure.

522
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,650
Pay attention to Qiuqiu's health.

523
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,175
Got it.

524
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,050
Zhixiao, goodbye.

525
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,725
Thank your parents for me.

526
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:35,750
Keep in touch.

527
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,400
Yeah.

528
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,175
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

529
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,560
The car is leaving.

530
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,500
Go, go, go.

531
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Let's go.

532
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,359
- Be careful.
- Safe trip.

533
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,425
- The bear.
- Thank you.

534
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,319
Save the bear a seat.

535
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:48,959
- Qiuqiu.
- Goodbye.

536
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,450
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

537
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,900
Let's go, Dr. Gu.

538
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,525
Uh-huh.

539
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,119
See.

540
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,400
This is Qiuqiu's gift for me.

541
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,300
This is obviously me, the cello.

542
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,550
Who is this one next to me?
Is it Qiuqiu?

543
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,450
How come he's so tall?

544
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,200
What's yours? Let me see it.

545
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,525
No.

546
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,425
I promised Qiuqiu
not to show it to anyone.

547
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,025
You're sneaky.

548
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:24,040
I've already shown it to you.

549
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,359
Why can't I see yours?

550
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:28,160
No.

551
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,319
Why can't I see it?

552
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,800
It won't hurt.

553
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,650
Fine, fine.

554
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,300
I don't want to see it.

555
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,325
Let me see it.

556
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:43,280
Let me see it.

557
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,750
Why can't I see it?

558
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,880
Your stitches

559
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,225
will be removed soon.

560
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,825
Don't just like that.

561
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,839
Gu Wei.

562
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,650
Have you prepared
the surgery plan for tomorrow?

563
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,225
Not yet.

564
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:26,640
I'll let you know when it' ready.

565
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,350
OK.

566
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:29,525
Don't forget about the seminar
on the first of next month,

567
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:31,239
you have to prepare in advance,

568
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,800
let's discuss later.

569
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,125
Oh, Gao Xi.

570
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,319
Did you get the tickets

571
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,719
from Lin Zhixiao?

572
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,050
I'm very busy.

573
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,350
I can't remember it.

574
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,075
Uh-huh.

575
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,900
I suppose so.

576
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,800
Isn't she from the music department?

577
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,600
I've been in contact with her
for a while,

578
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,050
she's kind of cute.

579
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
She is cute.

580
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,599
Lin Zhixiao.

581
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,850
Let me disinfect your wound first.

582
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,920
Dr. Gu.

583
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,300
Please be gentle.

584
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,650
It won't hurt.

585
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,550
Come here. Don't move.

586
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,550
I promise to be gentle.

587
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,225
Lin Zhixiao, I think,

588
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:39,706
you misunderstand me and Dr. Gao.

589
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,425
Dr. Gu.

590
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,800
Tell me the truth,

591
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,100
do you want to murder me?

592
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,725
I'm sorry.

593
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,319
Just a little more patience,

594
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,175
it will be done soon.

595
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,875
This is your last chance.

596
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,175
I promise it won't hurt at all.

597
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,050
Can I trust you?

598
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,975
You don't have a trust.

599
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,950
Don't touch it with your hand.

600
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,760
Come here.

601
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,719
Come here.

602
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,025
There you go.

603
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,119
It doesn't hurt, does it?

604
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,575
Is my hair still perfect?

605
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:50,275
Do I have a high hairline?

606
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:52,350
It's perfect.

607
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:56,600
Lin Zhixiao.

608
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,250
Uh-huh.

609
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,200
I think

610
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,641
you really misunderstood me and Dr. Gao

611
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,319
We were

612
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,575
classmates.

613
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,800
And now we're

614
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
colleague.

615
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,599
She is not my girlfriend,

616
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,900
nor is she my ex-girlfriend.

617
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,150
In fact,

618
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,600
what I mean is that

619
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,075
Dr. Gao and I

620
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:24,040
used to be classmates,

621
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:25,875
but now and in the future

622
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,725
we are just colleagues, understand?

623
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,500
I understand what you mean.

624
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,560
You mean

625
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,875
you're afraid I'll…

626
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Spread rumors!

627
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,239
I'm not that nosy.

628
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,200
Don't worry,

629
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,680
I won't tell anyone about it.

630
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,760
Besides, Lin will be discharged soon,

631
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,025
so I won't have this chance.

632
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,119
Yes,

633
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,525
Lin will be discharged tomorrow.

634
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:56,225
Uh-huh.

635
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,560
I couldn't be happier!

636
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,959
I was finally able to take off

637
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,675
the heavy responsibility
of VIP's special nursing.

638
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,439
I'm exhausted.

639
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,900
Speaking of that,

640
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,375
you and Ms. Li

641
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,816
are spoiling Li.

642
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,599
I sometimes think,

643
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,920
if only I had someone

644
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,319
to spoil me like this.

645
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,750
Seriously? Dr. Gu,

646
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,311
do you want to get sick?

647
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,280
Who would want to get sick?

648
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,525
Yeah.

649
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,075
Lin Zhixiao,

650
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,520
after you leave the hospital,

651
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,800
what are you going to do?

652
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,119
I'm going back to school

653
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,560
to continue my cello dream.

654
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm going to be

655
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,640
the best cellist in the country.

656
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:39,920
Going back to school.

657
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,225
It sounds like a life
from my previous life.

658
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
See, Dr. Gu,

659
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,100
you're acting like an old man again?

660
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,025
Well, if so,

661
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,500
do you feel there's
a generation gap between us?

662
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,550
I do feel that way

663
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,839
in terms of habits

664
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,275
and jargon.

665
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,079
And sometimes,

666
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,680
I feel like you're older than Lin.

667
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,325
I even want to call you Uncle.

668
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,119
Uncle.

669
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,325
Oh, right.

670
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:10,239
Did you get the tickets for the Concert?

671
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,875
Dr. Gao was supposed
to give them to you.

672
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,175
You must come.

673
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,199
I did.

674
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,850
What? you want me to come?

675
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,575
Of course. It's my concert,

676
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:20,400
of course I want you to be there.

677
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,319
Ms. Li needs to take care of Mr. Lin,

678
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,040
so she can't come.

679
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,050
If she can't make it,

680
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,119
of course I want you and Dr. Gao

681
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,300
to come and support me.

682
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,359
It occurred to me that I might

683
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,525
have a seminar that afternoon.

684
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,100
You know what?

685
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,625
I'll try to make time,

686
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,725
OK?

687
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh.

688
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,250
Let me help.

689
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:57,275
Are you OK?

690
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,050
I'm fine.

691
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,975
This thing of yours,

692
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,280
is it OK?

693
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,000
It's fine.

694
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,550
The stitches are removed.

695
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:13,400
You can leave now.

696
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,425
I'll clean up.

697
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:15,875
Uh-huh.

698
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:17,000
I'll leave you to it, then.

699
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,975
Bye, Dr. Gu.

700
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,925
Hey.

701
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,839
Don't get

702
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,680
any water on that wound.

703
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,475
Be careful.

704
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,400

See if there's anything left.

711
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:57,920
Don't leave it behind.

712
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,319
Don't worry. It's all checked out.

713
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,375
Where are you going?

714
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll get a contact number

715
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,160
from Dr. Gu.

He doesn't have private time for…

00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,050
I am. I am.

757
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,850
I listened to every word

758
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,719
You... You have

759
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,950
a great proposal.

760
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,775
See, who would I hire

761
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:09,825
if I don't hire you?

762
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,000
Come on, let's get something to eat.

763
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,199
Let's go. Interview's over.

764
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,050
No!

765
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,275
If we're gonna do this right,

766
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,150
we have to do it as soon as possible.

767
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,000
You see, this is the information

768
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,400
(58.com)
I picked up on 58. Com

769
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,920
about the right store
to open a coffee shop.

770
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,800
(58.com)
Some of them are pretty good.

771
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,599
You're so good.

772
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,500
You're so serious.

773
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,000
Let's go on a field trip right now.

774
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,400
Now?

775
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,400
Uh-huh.

776
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,575
You gotta be kidding me.

777
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,600
What are you doing?

778
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,560
Let's go!

779
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,959
OK, go.

780
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:54,171
(New schedule)

781
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:59,350
(Lin Jianguo, chemotherapy)

782
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:05,687
(Points for attention
in postoperative care)

783
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,125
(1. Semi-liquid diet,
eat less at a time…)

784
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,975
(Remember: no spicy food,
no smoking, no alcohol)

785
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:19,675
(Searching by phone number)

786
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,850
(Add)

787
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,775
(Hint: this user refuses to add anyone)

788
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:51,825
Oh, dear.

789
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,450
It's finally over.

790
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,875
You haven't slept in, like,

791
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,675
twenty-four hours since
your shift yesterday.

792
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,000
Go take a lunch break.

793
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,160
I'll take it from here.

794
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,040
Don't worry.

795
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,075
So considerate.

796
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,280
Get some rest.

797
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,125
OK.

798
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:13,175
Hey, Dr. Gu.

799
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,600
The clinic hours have been changed,

800
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,159
and the director wants you
to take the afternoon off.

801
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,300
No need.

802
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,040
I have a patient coming in
this afternoon for chemo.

803
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,875
Chemo?

804
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,800
Isn't that Dr. Gao's job?

805
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,425
I'm just checking for her.

806
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,439
OK.

807
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,959
(In-patient)

808
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,150
Zhixiao.

809
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,280
I'm paying the bill.

810
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
When Dr. Gu comes,

811
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,399
you should ask him

812
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,950
about the chemotherapy,

813
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,325
especially how to take care

814
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:43,975
of your dad, and make him suffer less.

815
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:44,575
It's very useful.

816
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:45,575
I got it.

817
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:46,479
Go pay the bill.

818
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,520
You think I'm nagging you again.

819
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,280
Stop it.

820
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,575
Dr. Gu…

821
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,950
Dr. Gao, it's you.

822
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,320
I'm the attending.

823
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,325
Post-op care

824
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:06,040
is my job.

825
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,159
Is there a problem.

826
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,475
No, no, it's just,

827
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,450
we've been talking to

828
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,479
Dr. Gu a lot,

829
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,825
and we know him pretty well.

830
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:15,250
But we're all very impressed

831
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,730
with your abilities.

832
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,675
We're talking about chemotherapy.

833
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,639
Shall we begin?

834
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,050
I have a lot of patients.

835
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,700
Yeah, yeah.

836
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,320
The chemotherapy,
which will take two days,

837
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,479
is based on the XELOX regimen,

838
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,840
which is made up of Oxaliplatin,

839
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,800
but in small doses,

840
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,760
along with liver protective drugs

841
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,000
and prescribed by your doctor.

842
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,200
Any reaction to the chemo?

843
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:37,200
Well, it depends on the person.

844
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:39,825
Can you be more specific?

845
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:40,650
Depends…

846
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,959
It means the patient
may experience nausea,

847
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,625
but vomiting cannot be ruled out.

848
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,850
Lin will have an upset stomach

849
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,400
and won't be able to eat?

850
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,080
Yes.

851
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,375
Well,

852
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,775
is there anything we can do about it?

853
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,125
Well, you can prepare something

854
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,325
nutritious and digestible.

855
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,950
If his appetite is really bad,

856
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,629
I'll give him some nourishment.

857
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,975
Oh.

858
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,875
Any questions?

859
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,520
No, no.

860
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,275
I'll take my leave then.

861
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:09,955
Sure.

862
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:11,800
Thank you, Dr. Gao.

863
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,675
What's going on?

864
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,150
Lin.

865
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,675
Big news.

866
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,625
You have

867
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,120
a beautiful woman

868
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,520
in charge of your chemo.

869
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,550
Dr. Gao?

870
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,325
Yes.

871
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,950
What's the fuss?

872
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,100
Dr. Gao has been my attending physician.

873
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,800
It's normal for her to be in charge.

874
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,439
You didn't look happy.

875
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,250
What were you doing?

876
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,825
I wasn't upset.

877
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,525
What's going on?

878
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:08,775
What?

879
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:09,974
I mean,

880
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,719
Dr. Gao is so beautiful.

881
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,959
Standing next to her

882
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,320
makes me look less pretty.

883
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,120
Right?

884
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,500
Always joking around.

885
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,199
(In-patient)
Dr. Gao, excuse me.

886
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,400
(In-patient)
It's just that my dad

887
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,080
used to be able to eat these,

888
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,320
and now he can't eat any of it.

889
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,639
I'm a little worried.

890
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,225
So I want to ask for your opinion.

891
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,800
It's normal after chemo.

892
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,675
I'm sending a text.

893
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,825
Dr. Gu, this is Lin Zhixiao.

894
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,550
I'm sorry to bother you,

895
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,800
but Mr. Lin can't eat
because of the reaction

896
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,900
of chemotherapy.

897
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,125
I don't know
if there is any way to help him.

898
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,199
I like Dr. Gu.

899
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,025
He looks cold on the surface,

900
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,775
but he's very warm-hearted.

901
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:39,218
(Doctor's Office 2)

902
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:50,425
How about now?

903
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,550
Would you like some porridge?

904
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:57,275
(Dr. Gu)

905
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,080
How about now?

906
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,725
Would you like some soup?

907
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,275
Mr. Lin.

908
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,750
This is not going to work.

909
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,950
You have to eat something.

910
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,950
Meat soup smells disgusting.

911
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,080
Vegetable soup it is.

912
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,475
No.

913
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,080
Noodles?

914
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,639
Porridge?

915
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:26,879
Wonton.

916
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,800
Lin Zhixiao.

917
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,840
There's a wonton restaurant

918
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,000
about a block east of the gate.

919
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,825
Get some vegan wontons for Mr. Lin.

920
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,700
OK, I'm on it.

921
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,719
Go, go.

922
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,450
Be careful on the road.

923
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,000
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

924
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,959
It's OK.

925
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,200
It's killing us.

926
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,400
Thanks.

927
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,300
You have to eat something.

928
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,800
OK, Thanks.

929
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,080
Well, I better get back to it.

930
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,679
Sure.

931
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,550
Thank you. Thank you.

932
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,560
You want wontons,

933
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:01,360
why didn't you say it?

934
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:04,325
Slow down.

935
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,650
Slow down.

936
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,425
Dr. Du.

937
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,350
Mr. Lin is eating something.

938
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,025
Thanks to Dr. Gu.

939
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,600
Dr. Gu was here?

940
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,300
He came back today?

941
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:26,700
He really cares about you.

942
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,050
He's really busy today.

943
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,959
He didn't have time to go

- I did?

988

990
