18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,239
Before I met you,

19
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,839
what was I doing?

20
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,550
When you suddenly asked,

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,250
I could hardly remember.

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,120
I was quite busy, I guess.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,175
Every day, I walked
through the familiar campus,

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,440
played the cello in the music room,

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,575
and looked forward
to the unpredictable future.

26
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,075
But I still remember

27
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,600
the day I met you.

28
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,400
When I looked up,

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,039
I looked right
into your eyes unexpectedly.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
It felt so special and beautiful

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,479
that every time I think back on it,

32
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,320
I want to tell you,

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
"even if life repeated many times,

34
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,000
in that spring,

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,320
I still wanted to meet you".

36
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,750
- Morning, Dr. Gu.
- Morning, Dr. Gu.

37
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,700
You have recuperated admirably.

38
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,800
Tomorrow afternoon, come to me
for the discharge paper.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,450
Mm.

40
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,700
Dr. Gu,

41
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,039
thank you for treating me.

42
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,800
May I come

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,320
and visit you later?

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,275
Every two months,

45
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:10,679
come to the hospital for a check.

46
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:11,520
No, no.

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I don't mean seeing a doctor.
I only mean you.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,440
This is my daughter, Meilu.

49
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,600
You're both young.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,520
Why don't you get to know each other?

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,160
Dr. Gu, may I have your phone number?

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,320
Sorry, Aunt Zhao.

53
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:21,550
Dr. Gu

54
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,679
has a girlfriend.

55
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,750
It's true.

56
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,750
His girlfriend is Dr. Gao Xi
of our hospital.

57
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,520
Dr. Gu, give me your number.

58
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,559
Come on.

59
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,080
Oh, I suddenly remember.

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
Director asked to see me.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
- I'll take my leave.
- Dr. Gu. Dr. Gu.

62
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,200
Give me your number.

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,399
Please.

64
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,199
Thank you.

65
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,425
Let me call him for you first.

66
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,065
Come on.

67
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:53,000

70
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,399
We don't usually notice it.

71
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,720
Gu Wei is really dedicated to his job.

72
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,525
Not to mention having a girlfriend,

73
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,440
he doesn't even...

74
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,160
He doesn't even go home often.

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,559
You know? So, I think

76
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,050
he and Dr. Gao Xi...

77
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,825
Gu Wei.

78
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:11,479
Learn more and gossip less.

79
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,700
- Yes.
- Okay.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,200
Gu Wei,

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,040
Vice President Gao told me

84
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,079
that you applied for transfer

85
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,325
and gave up being a clinician.

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,279
Yes.

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,125
But why?

88
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,000
Why didn't you discuss with me

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,475
such a big decision?

90
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,040
You're used to cooperating with me.

91
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,300
If I leave, you'll feel inadaptable.

92
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,800
But I've already made up my mind.

93
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,475
I may feel inadaptable at work.

94
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,500
But I care more about you.

95
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,450
When we finished postgraduate school,

96
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,725
you told me that you dreamed

97
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:33,025
to cure stomach cancer
during your lifetime.

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,519
We were studying so hard at school.

99
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,920
But now you tell me you're giving up?

100
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,959
- You...
- Gao Xi.

101
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:42,119
Say no more about it.

102
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,600
Gu Wei,

103
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,359
could you rethink it over?

104
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,725
Giving up being a clinician

105
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:58,165
would be a shame to you.

106
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:05,525
Sorry.

107
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,925

How was my performance?

108
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:10,880
(Huaqing University Orchestra)
Good.

109
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,925
I was a little bit nervous.

110
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,150
What on earth do you want again?

111
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,875
I'm very unhappy.

112
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,525
Very, very unhappy.

113
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

114
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,050
Mr. Lin and Ms. Li

115
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,089
haven't come at all.

116
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,100
I guess they didn't come deliberately.

117
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm still working.

118
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,675
Where shall we go?

119
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,000
You don't need to worry.

120
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,959
What am I afraid of?

121
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,200
Fine, fine. I get it.

122
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,079
I'll come after the ward round, okay?

123
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,000
He doesn't allow me to go there,
but I'll just go.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,605
Deal, then. See you tonight.

125
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,700
Stand there.

128

- Zhixiao!
- Sansan!

129
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,500
I haven't seen you for ages.

130
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,480
Since you went abroad,

131
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
you've changed so much.

132
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,025
Have I?

133
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,675
Am I gorgeous now?

135
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:19,625
Of course.

136
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,239
You're not only gorgeous,

137
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,760
but also very fashionable.

138
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,825
But aren't you too sexy?

139
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,800
Come on.

140
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,750
This is how a supermodel looks.

141
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,850
Don't you understand?

142
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,325
Fine, supermodel.

143
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,446
I miss you so much, Sansan.

144
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:36,075
Why did you come to a pub

145
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:37,525
in such a suit?

146
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,450
I just... I just didn't know

147
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,175
I would come here.

148
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,399
You still need me

149
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,399
to dress you up.

150
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,350
What?

151
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,875
What are you looking at?

152
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
Don't move. Don't.

153
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,760
I'll put a different color
of lipstick on you.

154
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,000
Is that necessary?

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,775
Come on.

156
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,480
Lipsticks are very important to a girl.

157
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,160
Come over.

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
People are watching.

159
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,450
It's okay. You're beautiful.
Don't be afraid.

160
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,725
The lipstick smudged.

161
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,600
Quickly.

162
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,525
Press your lips together.

163
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,920
Okay?

164
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,625
Mm.

165
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,880
Something's missing, I feel.

166
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,559
Don't do this.

167
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,400
Look at your pigtail. How serious!

168
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,680
You look just like a little girl.

169
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
I do?

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,559
Yes.

171
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,760
- How do I look now?
- Let me check.

172
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,175
Do I look like a woman?

173
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,775
Much better.

174
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,725
How do I look?

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,359
If I stayed with you these years,

176
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,840
you would have been
Shao Jiang's girlfriend

177
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,200
and needn't have...

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,440
I can't bring him up?

179
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,425
Let's not talk about him today.

180
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,950
Go, go. Let's get in.

181
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:47,875
Wei,

182
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,150
you're not hyper at all.

183
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,125
What are you doing? Giving an operation?

184
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,000
Why don't you celebrate your birthday

185
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,750
with your parents?

186
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,799
It doesn't matter
whom I celebrate my birthday with.

187
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,125
The most important thing is

188
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,950
that I'll have fun with you today.

189
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,775
Wei, look.

190
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,500
So many beautiful girls are around.

191
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,200
Don't you like any of them?

192
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,850
Keep filling the cup.

193
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,200
I've still got some in the cup.

194
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,000
Stop it.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,175
Drink it up. Drink it up.

196
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,275
I can't drink anymore.

197
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,599
Where are the beautiful girls?

198
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,800
Why can't I see any?

199
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,050
You can't? They're all around us.

200
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,025
Let me find one for you.

201
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:23,225
Wei, Wei.

202
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,400
Look at her legs.

203
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,919
What long legs!

204
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,960
What do you think?

205
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,039
She has anterior pelvic tilt

206
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,320
and terrible spinal curvature.

207
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,750
She wears high-heeled shoes too much.

208
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,100
She should see an orthopedist.

209
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,080
How about that one?

210
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,599
She's wearing block-heeled shoes.

211
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,400
Even heavy makeup
can't cover her dark circles.

212
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,000
She must have always stayed up late.

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,150
She should see a neurologist.

214
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,280
What about that one?

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,950
She's got more problems.

216
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,719
She should have a complete checkup.

217
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,880
Fine.

218
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,559
Good point.

219
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,100
Drink some wine, all right?

220
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,850
What have you ordered?

221
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,719
Alcohol-free mojito?

222
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,025
Drink something with alcohol.

223
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,275
I have to work tomorrow.
I can't drink any wine.

224
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,575
But it's been a long while
since you last gave an operation...

225
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,359
Wei,

226
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,640
when can you

227
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,275
return to normal?

228
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,700
Why not try...?

229
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,799
Try some wine.

230
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,960
Someone's calling you. Don't you answer?

231
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,725
Hello? What again?

232
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm not home.

233
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,799
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

234
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,679
To Sansan's coming back.

235
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,575
Stop, stop.

236
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:40,525
You'd better not drink it.

237
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:41,640
Have some ice tea instead.

238
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,900
You have to go home tonight.

239
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,050
I don't want to trigger

240
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,760
a family conflict.

241
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,550
Mr. Lin is horrible.

242
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,800
I don't want him to give me a lecture.

243
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,275
What are you talking about?

244
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,359
Zhixiao lives under strict family rules.

245
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,359
Her father Mr. Lin

246
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:59,239
has been a dean of a high school
for 20 years.

247
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,800
He is...

248
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,159
Quite strict. Right.

249
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,400
Quite strict.

250
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm his daughter.

251
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,039
He always punishes me

252
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,119
as a warning to others.

253
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,850
I'm one of the others.

254
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,325
Let's not talk about him.

255
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,450
Anyway, he's a ridiculous father.

256
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,425
Honey,

257
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:37,039
don't worry.

258
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,880
It's not 11:00 PM yet.

259
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,475
Maybe she'll be back soon.

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,625
Then why did she turn her phone off?

261
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,400
It just ran out of battery...

262
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,925
You always indulge her.

263
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,875
You and your daughter

264
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,750
always act in collusion.

265
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,850
Don't get me involved
when complaining about your daughter.

266
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,550
Did Lin Zhixiao mention

267
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:05,919
that Xiao Shan would return to China?

268
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,320
What's gone is gone.

269
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,450
Now, everything is different.

270
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,825
Mr. Lin can't restrain me all my life.

271
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,039
From this day on,

272
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,960
I'll be independent!

273
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,440
Cheers!

274
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
I'll drink with you, then. Cheers.

275
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,275
Bottoms up. All of us.

276
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:19,425
- Bottoms up.
- Fine.

277
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,525
(Sansan: I finally met Zhixiao.
How happy we are!)

278
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,425
She's indeed hanging around
with Xiao Shan.

279
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,775
Wait.

280
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,250
Where are you going, honey?

281
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,750
Stop drinking if you can't drink a lot.

282
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,450
I can certainly drink more. I'm okay.

283
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,929
What are you doing?

284
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,875
Haven't drunk it up yet?
Who are you saving it for?

285
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,280
Waiter.

286
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,225
The bill, please.

287
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:55,799
Let's go for the midnight snack.

288
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,450
All right.

289
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,200
That man looks so handsome.

290
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,159
I quite agree.

291
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,960
He's so cool.

292
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,550
Go.

293
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,000
The plants prickle me.

294
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,175
I know, I know. Just walk.

295
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,625
Be careful. Walk carefully.

296
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,479
Mr. Lin and Ms. Li...

297
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,000
Why do they think
they can look down on me?

298
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,950
Why do they look down on me?

299
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,875
They always deceive me.

300
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,450
They don't support my dream, right?

301
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,850
The point is

302
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,925
they always foist their beliefs

303
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,275
on me.

304
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,674
But I don't like that.

305
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,425
I'm a girl that nobody loves.

306
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:54,175
It's okay. It's okay.

307
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,900
They don't love you, but I do.

308
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,000
I love you. Good girl.

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,599
- Sansan,
- Good girl.

310
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,550
- I know you're the best to me.
- I love you. I love you.

311
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,625
I swear

312
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,925
I never want to see

313
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,919
Ms. Li or Mr. Lin again,

314
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,880
especially Mr. Lin.

315
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,525
I'll never see him again!

316
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,950
Okay. Don't see him again.

317
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,050
As you wish.

318
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,525
Sansan.

319
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:27,175
Mm?

320
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,450
Am I drunk

321
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,760
or am I hallucinating?

322
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,700
I think I see Mr. Lin.

323
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,875
Is that Mr. Lin?

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,225
Oh, it is.

325
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,575
Didn't you just say you loved me?

326
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,175
Looking for Gu Xiao? He's out.

327
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,275
Didn't you hear me? He's out.

328
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,840
I know.

329
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,425
I just want to say hello to you.

330
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,075
Hello, sir.

331
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,719
I guess I drank so much

332
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,900
that I feel very dizzy now.

333
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,919
I can hardly walk.

334
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,320
May I stay here for a couple of minutes?

335
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,080
Just a couple of minutes.

336
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,760
Thank you.

337
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,150
If you feel too dizzy,

338
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,400
you lack alcohol dehydrogenase,
I'm afraid.

339
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,550
You'd better see a doctor

340
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,679
for a checkup.

341
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,400
Okay, okay.

342
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,320
No problem.

343
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,300
I'll go see a doctor tomorrow morning.

344
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,840
I'm sorry to disturb you.

345
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,239
Enjoy yourself. Ignore me.

346
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,644
May... May I borrow your coat
for a few minutes?

347
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:02,625
But who are you?

348
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,850
Don't bother who I am.

349
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,550
- Give my coat back to me.
- What are you doing?

350
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,325
Could you keep quiet for a minute?

351
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:07,875
- Be quiet, please.
- Give my coat back to me.

352
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,425
Why can't you just lend it to me?

353
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,559
I...

354
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,440
Don't pull it. Or you'll damage it.

355
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
- Give it back to me.
- What are you...?

356
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,700
Why are you pulling it so hard?

357
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
- Stop pulling it.
- Security! I...

358
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:16,960
Stop.

359
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,039
- You...
- It's...

360
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:36,500
Lin Zhixiao?

361
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,400
Lin Zhixiao?

362
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,359
Lin Zhixiao!

363
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,600
Lin Zhixiao!

364
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,239
What have you done?

365
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,080
Nothing.

366
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,950
Who's he?

367
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,125
Your boyfriend?

368
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,200
- No.
- Yes.

369
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
What an unsavory man!

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,750
He even denied it
in front of your father.

371
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,325
He's my boyfriend.

372
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:04,359
My boyfriend.

373
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,520
You didn't show up when you should.

374
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,700
You didn't care about me
when I was in need.

375
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,239
Now you want to interfere?
You know what?

376
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:09,375
You can't.

377
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,160
You're quite out of control.

378
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,400
- Put your arm down.
- I won't.

379
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,160
Put your arm down!

380
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,725
Look how ridiculous you are!

381
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

382
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,200
Let me explain first.

383
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,775
I'm not her boyfriend.

384
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,199
You must be her father.

385
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,760
Take her back home
and give her a lecture.

386
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,725
A young girl like her got drunk in a pub

387
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:28,500
and harassed me.

388
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,239
Obviously, she has bad manners.

389
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,150
Please take her back home

390
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,464
so that she'll no longer trouble others.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,625
Who are you talking about?

392
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,599
Why do you think
you can judge my daughter?

393
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,479
What were you doing just now?

394
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,839
Flirting with her?

395
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,950
Why do I have bad manners?

396
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,050
You're the one who has bad manners.

397
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,250
When you saw a drunk young girl,

398
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,160
you wanted to flirt with her.

399
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
You have quite bad manners.

400
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,599
Exactly. Bad man!

401
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,520
Bad man. Bad man.

402
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,280
You're the bad man.

403
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,125
You know what?

404
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,645
You're such a bad...

405
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,150
Lin Zhixiao!

406
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,400
Wei.

407
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,300
Wei, Wei.

408
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,475
Wei,

409
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,239
what happened?

410
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,650
I was away for only a while.

411
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,700
What happened then?

412
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,225
Why did you try

413
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:24,350
to flirt with a girl?

414
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,700
Come on.

415
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,479
They were cursing you like that.

416
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,825
What on earth did you do to that girl?

417
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,475
Don't ask a ridiculous question.

418
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,760
Anyway,

419
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,700
never take me to such a place again.

420
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,550
But...

421
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,150
It's just a pub...

422
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,839
Go.

423
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,680
Zhixiao. Zhixiao.

424
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,760
Call me when you're home.

425
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,675
Call me.

426
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,725
Ridiculous girl.

427
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,075
Wei, Wei.

428
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,675
I left my wallet there.

429
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,675
You may leave. Don't wait for me.

430
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,680
Leave without me.

431
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:13,650
A glass of tequila.

432
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,800
Two glasses, please.

433
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,150
It's on me.

434
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,325
You dropped your coat.

435
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:32,450
Have you got a light?

436
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,150
Boy,

437
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,925
tequila is not right for you.

438
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,500
Have a glass of milk instead.

439
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,750
Wipe your hand.

440
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,700
It's on me.

441
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,525
(YS-SS8011)

442
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,100
You're back?

443
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,359
It's really late.

444
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,520
- Zhixiao. Zhixiao.
- What?

445
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Take a bath and go to bed.

446
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,500
What?

447
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,325
Stand there.

448
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,700
Remove your lipstick.

449
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,000
Mr. Lin,

450
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,560
check the date, will you?

451
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,920
I graduated from high school
three years ago.

452
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,880
Still trying to restrain me
in the same old way?

453
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,599
Stop. You both sound aggressive.

454
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,599
Talk tomorrow.

455
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,075
Do you know where she was?

456
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,100
She was in a pub.

457
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,000
She drank wine and hang around.

458
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,350
She wore a heavy makeup

459
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,400
and even cuddled

460
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,520
an unsavory man.

461
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,575
She was going too far!

462
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:08,150
You'll finish college next year.

463
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,760
Look what your classmates are doing.

464
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,000
They're either looking for a job

465
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,479
or preparing
for the graduate entrance exam.

466
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,280
Yin Xi

467
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,550
has even got

468
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,229
the offer of an exchange visit overseas.

469
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,359
What about you?

470
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,000
You're still idling about

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,079
and have achieved nothing!

472
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,119
If you go on like this,

473
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,675
you'll be the scum of the earth!

474
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,950
This is too much!

475
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,520
Why will I be the scum of the earth?

476
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,975
I'm...

477
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,150
I'm a decent college student.

478
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,300
I play the cello.

479
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,760
And I'll be a cellist.

480
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,375
Why will I be the scum of the earth?

481
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,675
I invited you

482
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,280
to today's concert,

483
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,075
didn't I?

484
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,075
What did you say?

485
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:52,835
You said

486
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,119
you would come and watch it

487
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,119
and you would allow me to be a cellist

488
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,525
if I did a good job.

489
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:57,726
But did you come?

490
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,050
You didn't.

491
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,175
When you didn't even see my performance,

492
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:04,150
you wouldn't know
how well I played the cello.

493
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,040
Zhixiao, actually, today...

494
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,300
Stop talking.

495
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,125
Tell me.

496
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,479
I'm a cellist.

497
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,175
Is it humiliating?

498
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:14,950
No.

499
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,150
Then why does he look down on me?

500
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,775
Why do you look down on me?

501
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,650
I just see how you're doing

502
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,475
and want you to avoid detours.

503
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,550
Think about it.

504
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,280
You play the cello so poorly.

505
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,599
How can you dream to make a living
by being a cellist?

506
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,760
Being a postgraduate

507
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,959
and serving as a teacher
after graduation

508
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,479
will be the best choice for your future.

509
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,775
Stop wasting your time!

510
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,325
I know you look down on me.

511
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,400
Do you think

512
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,250
you are a very good father?

513
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,975
Since I was little,

514
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:49,275
you've been a dean at school.

515
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,600
You've been a dean at home, too.

516
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,550
Have you not been tough on me

517
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,075
as a dean

518
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:56,475
for even one single day?

519
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,875
Do you know what my dream is?

520
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,450
Do you know what I want?

521
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:05,975
You've never cared about me.

522
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:07,750
You've never understood me either.

523
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,850
Since I was little,

524
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,199
you've only been giving me plans

525
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,250
and making me

526
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,000
live a life in the way you dream of.

527
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,375
But I have my own dream.

528
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,775
I dream to be a cellist.

529
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:24,175
Is it humiliating?

530
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,275
You're my family.

531
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,925
But you don't even understand me.

532
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,750
Let me tell you something.

533
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,925
I will not take
the graduate entrance exam.

534
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:39,275
I won't be a teacher either.

535
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,575
Perish the thought!

536
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,275
Zhixiao...

537
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,280
Stop complaining about her.

538
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,125
I'm sure she thinks

539
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,280
we didn't go to the concert
deliberately.

540
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,850
I'll just explain to her.

541
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,900
Ouch.

542
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:55,625
Ouch.

543
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:56,875
What's wrong, honey?

544
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,100
You've got a stomach ache again?

545
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,675
Don't get angry. Calm down.

546
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,300
I'll go get the medicine for you.

I don't care.

571
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000

I'll call you when she's ready.

00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,959

685

is not particularly good.

to help the percussion group.

Your teacher

696
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,560
is going too far, isn't he?

697
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,599

698
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,920

701
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,975
I'm redundant.

702
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,200
Zhixiao…

703
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,575
That's nothing.

704
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:23,880
After finishing this Coke,

705
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
I will start afresh.

706
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,199
It's nothing to be ashamed
of being demoted to knock the triangle.

707
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,479
I will rise in the future.

708
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,079
I want to solo.

709
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,880

714
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,599
Go ahead.

715
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,075
I don't want to be a third wheel.

716
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,359
Go, go.

717
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,300
Then I'm leaving.

722
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800

732
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,150
I want to be a cellist.

733
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,925
Lin Zhixiao!

734
00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:15,600
What?

735
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,199
Be obedient when you should be.

736
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,850
Have you ever respected me?

737
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,900
Have you ever listened to

738
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,325
what I told you?

739
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,560
I said I don't want to take the exam.

740
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,125
I will never take the exam.

741
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,360
You…! Why are you so stubborn?

742
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,450
- You…!
- Honey.

743
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,350
Haven't we agreed?

744
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,560
Zhixiao,

745
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,919
ignore your dad.

746
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:32,725
You go wash your hands first.

747
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:33,700
Let's eat soon.

748
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,725
We'll talk about it after dinner.

749
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,275
Could you cut it out?

750
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,000
Is that my phone?

751
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,925
Your phone, Ms. Li.

752
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:46,375
Could you pass it to me, Zhixiao?

753
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,125
Hello?

754
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,320
Hello?

755
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,975
Is this Lin Jianguo's home?

756
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,175
Yeah. You are…?

757
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,560
This is Dr. Gu Wei

758
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,625
from Gastroenterology Center,

759
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,385
Huaqing University
First Affiliated Hospital.

760
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,125
Dr. Gu of Gastroenterology Center?

761
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,879
We've always seen Dr. Gao.

762
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:10,239
We apply a multidisciplinary consultation
in our hospital.

763
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,375
Dr. Gao and I

764
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,896
work in the same team.

765
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,080
Glad to know you.

766
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,525
What can I do for you?

767
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:18,360
I want you to be hospitalized
as soon as possible

768
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,550
to treat gastric ulcer

769
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,679
and take another gastroscopy
at the same time.

770
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,239
Another gastroscopy?

771
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,025
We already took one.

772
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,825
With my experience,

773
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,679
there is one possibility
that he has stomach cancer.

774
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,300
It's just my suggestion.

775
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,520
For the specific situation,

776
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,560
we can only come to a conclusion

777
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,700
until you take the examination

778
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,980
in the hospital.

779
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,719
Okay. Okay.

780
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,200
I get it.

781
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,950
Then please go for the admission procedure
as soon as possible.

782
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,159
Mm. Bye.

783
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,159
What? What's going on?

784
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,639
Nothing. It's from the hospital.

785
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,719
Let's talk about it later.

786
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,850
Go wash your hands.

787
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,850
We will be hospitalized tomorrow.

788
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,050
Your gastric ulcer

789
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,639
should be well treated.

790
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,425
I have a business to do tomorrow.

791
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,450
I won't go.

792
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,320
Just follow the doctor's advice.

793
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,725
You forget what you said to me?

794
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,675
Be obedient when you should be.

795
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,675
I will go with you tomorrow.

796
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:21,360
Everything has its vanquisher.

797
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,075
Here, Zhixiao.

798
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,975
Eat more vegetables.

799
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:53,239
(In-patient)

800
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,159
Here we are, sir.

801
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,750
Please open the trunk.

802
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,475
Thank you.

803
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:03,199
It's okay. I can do it.

804
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:04,719
How about this?

805
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,000
I'll go through the formalities first.

806
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,840
- Hey.
- You and your...

807
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,950
(In-patient)
Mr. Lin.

808
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,040
Mr. Lin!

809
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,800
Honey! Honey!

810
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,175
Why is he gone?

811
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,650
Excuse me.

812
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,875
We are here to handle the admission

813
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:30,919
for Lin Jianguo.

814
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:32,350
One doctor surnamed...

815
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:32,840
Gu.

816
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,719
A doctor surnamed Gu asked us here.

817
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,875
Dr. Gu has given you a list.

818
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,000
You can go handle it now.

819
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The patient can follow me
for an examination.

820
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,800
Patient?

821
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:46,425
He didn't come.

822
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,840
I said I'm fine.

823
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,199
I'm not going back to the hospital.

824
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,439
I tell you,

825
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:11,525
Zhixiao suddenly
had a stomachache just now

826
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:13,320
and she almost passed out.

827
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,479
The doctor said

828
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,425
she may have acute appendicitis.

829
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,679
Maybe she has to have an operation.

830
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,625
Who are you kidding?

831
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,320
Is it so easy to get appendicitis?

832
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,800
Do you think I'm a three-year-old child?

833
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:27,320
Ms. Li,

834
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,625
my stomach hurts.

835
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,850
Did you hear that?

836
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,250
Look at her.

837
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,879
Hurry up.

838
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,300
Did you hear me?

839
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:39,639
You are trying to trick me!

840
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,700
Did I play well?

841
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,500
Did I exaggerate it?

842
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:46,840
A little. I'll go downstairs first.

843
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,600
Oh my goodness. My superb acting skills.

844
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,281
It's a pity that I'm not an actress.

845
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,925
Where is she?

846
00:38:58,225 --> 00:38:59,040
There she is.

847
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,150
There.

848
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:01,975
Zhixiao.

849
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,125
Zhixiao, what's wrong with you?

850
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:07,350
Mr. Lin, why are you here so late?

851
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,639
It hurts like hell.

852
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,760
Okay, okay.

853
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,675
Have you handled
the admission procedure?

854
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:12,800
Yes, I have.

855
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,150
Where is the ward?

856
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:15,775
- That one.
- This one.

857
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,280
- This one.
- That one.

858
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:19,225
Then get in the ward quickly.

859
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:19,840
This... this one...

860
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,879
Why are you squatting here?

861
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:21,919
- This one.
- This one?

862
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:22,919
Slow down. Slow down.

863
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,280
Here.

864
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,840
I got you.

865
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,879
- Let me help you.
- It hurts.

866
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:26,600
Okay.

867
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,320
Will I be alright?

868
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
You'll be fine.

869
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,000
You'll be fine.

870
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,159
There are doctors in the hospital.

871
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:32,950
You'll be fine.

872
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,050
Lie down. Lie down.

873
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,050
Mr. Lin…

874
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,040
- My stomach hurts.
- Where's the doctor?

875
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Where's the doctor?

876
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,800
I'll call the doctor.

877
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,679
You stay with her.

878
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,900
- Don't leave.
- Hurry up and go.

879
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,500
Okay.

880
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,719
Mr. Lin.

881
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,360
I'll be fine, right?

882
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,679
I'm so young.

883
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,950
You'll be fine, Zhixiao.

884
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,550
Don't worry. I'm here with you.

885
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,650
You don't have to be afraid.

886
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,600
- Okay.
- If it hurts badly,

887
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,925
you just grab my hands.

888
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:53,919
- Okay.
- All right?

889
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:54,719
Be strong.

890
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,639
I am strong.

891
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,159
Think about the hero's story

892
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,725
that I told you when you were a kid.

893
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,360
(Bed 14 Wang Changyou, Gender: male)
Hold on, okay?

894
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,879
(Bed 14 Wang Changyou, Gender: male)
Okay.

895
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,150
(Bed 14 Wang Changyou, Gender: male)
Be good.

896
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,239
Where are you going, Mr. Lin?

897
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,125
I… Why isn't your mother back yet?

898
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,439
I'll take a look at the door
and come back soon.

899
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:11,560
No, I'm very vulnerable right now.

900
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,075
I can't stay without people around me.

901
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:14,500
I won't go. I won't go far.

902
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,175
Oops, it hurts.

903
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:17,439
Zhixiao, be good. I'll be back soon.

904
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:18,275
Well...

905
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,360
I'll be...

906
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:20,919
Doctor, you're here in time.

907
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,575
My daughter is suffering
from acute appendicitis.

908
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:23,800
It hurts badly.

909
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,439
Please check on her.

910
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:26,900
No worries. I...

911
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,850
It really hurts, doctor.

912
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,679
Enjoy yourself. Ignore me.

913
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,125
May... May I borrow your coat
for a few minutes?

914
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,199
But who are you?

915
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,080
Don't bother who I am.

916
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,360
Exactly. Bad man!

917
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,225
Bad man. Bad man.

918
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:38,120
You're the bad man.

919
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,639
Normal heart rate

920
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,320
is 70-80 beats per minute.

921
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,520
But your heart rate

922
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,879
is 130 beats per minute.

923
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:52,159
Hello? Security?

924
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,600
There is a suspicious person here.

925
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,961
Please come here right now.

926
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,950
It's acute appendicitis, right?

927
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:04,479
No worries.

928
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,750
Let me check on you.

929
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,225
Let your hands go.

930
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,040
Does it hurt?

931
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:13,840
Yeah.

932
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,475
It hurts?

933
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:15,850
It hurts.

934
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:17,080
Appendix

935
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,750
is here, isn't it?

936
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,175
Is it?

937
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:23,439
Does it hurt?

938
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,360
It hurts, too.

939
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,439
- It hurts?
- Yeah.

940
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,800
This part hurts, doctor.

941
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,150
You have a big problem.

942
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,919
Really?

943
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,399
I have to operate on you right away.

944
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:33,280
No need, doctor.

945
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,639
You are a bit rushed, aren't you?

946
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,600
Are you having an operation
without an examination?

947
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,425
Yeah, doctor.

948
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:38,439
You should be prudent.

949
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,040
Is the operation dangerous?

950
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,239
Please don't worry.

951
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,300
There are risks
associated with any operation.

952
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:44,900
Bur rest assured,

953
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,760
I will try to minimize the risks

954
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,775
of the operation.

955
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,360
Doctor,

956
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,125
after your examination,

957
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,250
I feel

958
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,840
it doesn't hurt so badly now.

959
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,800
I don't think I need an operation.

960
00:41:56,825 --> 00:41:58,840
I've seen too many patients like you.

961
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,000
They always thought

962
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,120
acute appendicitis is not a big problem.

963
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,520
The longer it takes,
the worse it becomes.

964
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,159
Finally, it may lead to a major disease.

965
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,040
- Xiaowei.
- Yes.

966
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,719
Notify the Operating Room to prepare
for an operation immediately.

967
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,639
Okay, Dr. Gu.

968
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,199
Wait a minute.

969
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,175
Hang on!

970
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,100
I feel better suddenly.

971
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:13,075
I'm good.

972
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,120
I mean it.

973
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:18,280
Mr. Lin, I'm fine.

974
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:21,320
You...

975
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,950
Sorry, I was wrong.

976
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,159
I pretended it.

977
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,525
I'm actually fine.

978
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,800
It's all because you refused to come.

979
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,639
I had no other way.

980
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,120
I had to do this.

981
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,000
Lin Zhixiao, you...!

982
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:32,600
You're willful!

983
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,120
Don't you know I'm worried?

984
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,840
Don't you know this is a hospital?

985
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,275
No noise in the hospital.

986
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,439
Okay, okay, okay.

987
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:39,199
Sorry, doctor.

988
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,159
Since you are not sick,

989
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,199
just go out.

990
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,325
I'm not sick. But he's really sick.

991
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,719
No, I mean,

992
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,239
he needs hospitalization.

993
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,825
Sorry, doctor.

994
00:42:48,825 --> 00:42:50,146
We didn't mean to make a scene.

995
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:52,650
I just saw that
the bed is temporarily unoccupied,

996
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,320
so I used it for a few minutes.

997
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,679
The patient in Bed 14

998
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,040
is under observation after an operation.

999
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,560
He may be pushed back at any time.

1000
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,439
You occupied
another people's bed like this.

1001
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,679
It's against the hospital regulations.

1002
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,399
Do you know?

1003
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:03,040
Okay.

1004
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,080
Sorry, sorry.

1005
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,959
Let's go. Go.

1006
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:05,879
- Let's go.
- Zhixiao.

1007
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:07,080
The formalities are done.

1008
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:09,520
Let's go find that Dr. Gu.

1009
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,100
She screws it up.

1010
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,475
You guys come with me to the office.

1011
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:25,706
- It's you.
- It's you!

1012
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:37,858
Zhixiao, you are so beautiful.

1013
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:38,950
=The Oath of Love=
Of course.

1014
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,450
=The Oath of Love=
I mean the night view.

1015
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,525
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
Say it again.

1016
00:43:41,775 --> 00:43:42,800
- Speak well.
- You are more beautiful.

1017
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,050
Fine. You are more beautiful.

1018
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:48,449
You know what?

1019
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:50,500
That time in the hospital,

1020
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,229
you were wearing a mask

1021
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,053
and I didn't recognize you at all.

1022
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,375
But let me tell you something.

1023
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:57,225
Mm.

1024
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:00,416
I looked at you

1025
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,400
wearing the mask

1026
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,300
and my heart was racing.

1027
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:04,975
Mm.

1028
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,557
But I don't think my heart raced

1029
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:08,749
because I was lying.

1030
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,525
I think it's because you have nice eyes,

1031
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,275
so my heartbeat became faster.

1032
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,558
I'll tell you one thing, too.

1033
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:19,525
What's it?

1034
00:44:20,475 --> 00:44:22,575
In fact, I felt your pulse that day.

1035
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:24,425
I didn't touch anything at all.

1036
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,900
I lied to you.

1037
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,425
Really?

1038
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,925
Explain to me.

1039
