(She didn't accept.)

3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,800
(She didn't accept!)

(Lu Xun)
(Are you going back to the hospital tonight?)

7
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,750
(Thank you?)

8
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,320
(No.)

9
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,240
(It would reveal that)

10
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,910
(I have seen)

11
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,960
(the light board.)

12
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,800
(It's none of your business?)

13
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,440
(It will go too far.)

14
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,960
Lu confessed to you?

15
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,270
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,110
I told you that

17
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,080
you misunderstood our relationship.

18
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,190
We are classmates

19
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,630
who work hard together.

20
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,240
I've been through it all.

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,390
I can tell that.

22
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,630
The expression in his eyes…

23
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,270
Are you two

24
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,670
almost there?

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,880
Should I do you a favor?

26
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:06,880
Listen.

27
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,390
Even if we were to be together soon,

28
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,000
I would completely

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
cut off the possibility.

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,110
Are you crazy?

31
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,190
He seems to be reliable.

32
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,470
Although his appearance

33
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,550
hasn't reached the level of our family,

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
he's a good guy.

35
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,190
What's the matter with you?

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,550
I don't like a younger brother.

37
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,270
Lu.

38
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,360
You're here so late.

39
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,830
I just stopped by.

40
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,190
Well.

41
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,270
Should I

42
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,960
leave you two alone

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,270
for romance?

44
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,520
Stay here.

45
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,160
Look at you.

46
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,620
(Advertising space for rent)

47
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,600
Good night.

49
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,390
Straighten your arm.

50
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,070
And three, two, one.

51
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,700
(The 14th Student Sports Meeting)

52
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,760
That's it.

53
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,670
My badminton skills are among the best
in the Northeast.

54
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,670
When I was 11,

55
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,270
I shocked everyone
with a difficult move.

56
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,760
Now for a man,

57
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,880
I am learning from serving.

58
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,670
My coach

59
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,480
would be pissed

60
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,550
if he saw it.

61
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,160
Got that?

62
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,230
Cool.

63
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,640
But I don't

64
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,230
seem to understand.

65
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,200
Never mind.

66
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,270
I will help you

67
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,000
later on.

68
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:08,950
Xue.

69
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,880
Come on.

70
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,600
Come on.

71
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,760
Love is like a spring.

72
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,270
One's loss is another's gain.

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,160
Liu.

74
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,110
Hold on!

75
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,440
Sportsmanship is nothing

76
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,270
in the face of love.

77
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,440
Coach would forgive me.

78
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,390
I can't stand it anymore.

79
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,830
You were way too low-key.

80
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,510
Luckily I wasn't exposed.

81
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,390
Good one.

82
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,320
Really?

83
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,480
I don't think so.

84
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,550
Shiyun.

85
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,070
Are you okay?

86
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,040
Tang Lyu.

87
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,720
Your girlfriend plays badminton

88
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,550
better than you.

89
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
She is a newbie.

90
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:34,960
And she plays

91
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,000
by luck.

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
You can't play badminton like this

93
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,320
for the first time.

94
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,080
I can't make it.

95
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,790
I sprained the ankle.

96
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,110
Come on.

97
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320
We just started.

98
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,080
Let's play.

99
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,880
Right.

100
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,590
Okay.

101
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,280
Wait a minute.

102
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,030
Let me check.

103
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,910
You just

104
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,670
pulled the muscle.

105
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,880
I'll give you a massage

106
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,640
in a while.

107
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,150
If you quit,

108
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,960
we can't continue.

109
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,470
They are just in the mood.

110
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,910
We'd better not spoil the fun.

111
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,910
Didn't you see her hurt?

112
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,590
You are such

113
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,590
an incompetent boyfriend.

114
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,350
Qian Chuan.

115
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,790
Easy.

116
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,400
Is it serious?

117
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,150
Not that serious.

118
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,760
Good for you.

119
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,470
Sit here.

120
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you need a partner so much?

121
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,280
I will play with you.

122
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,710
Chuan.

123
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Can you play badminton?

124
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,030
So kind of you.

125
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,350
No need.

126
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,840
Tang Lyu is just saying.

127
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,520
Okay.

128
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,550
One on one.

129
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,590
Do you dare?

130
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,200
Don't be afraid of getting hurt.

131
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,520
I will cure you.

132
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,790
Qian Chuan, can you play it?

133
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Of course I can.

134
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,520
Chuan.

135
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,230
Come on!

136
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,350
Good!

137
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,000
Nice!

138
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,590
If you don't have the ability,

139
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,790
don't force yourself.

140
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,910
Admit defeat.

141
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,710
Sportsmanship

142
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,150
means never admit defeat.

143
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,320
You haven't reached 21 points.

144
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,790
I haven't lost yet.

145
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,670
Even if you want to turn the tide,

146
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,200
I don't want to continue.

147
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,200
Qian Chuan.

148
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,550
Are you alright?

149
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,230
Tang Lyu.

150
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,790
You know he can't play badminton,

151
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,960
why target him?

152
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,150
Help him.

153
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,470
Are you okay?

154
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,790
Are you okay?

155
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,150
He went too far.

156
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,200
How could he do this?

157
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm fine.

158
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,760
I don't think you're fine.

159
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,080
Tell me if you feel bad.

160
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,960
I will cure you.

161
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,520
Stop showing off.

162
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,230
You think you're incredible?

163
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,030
You can cure him?

164
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:02,910
Let's go.

165
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,520
I asked you to be mild.

166
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,840
Why did you become a tigress?

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I am just

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,590
a real manchurian tiger.

169
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,080
I can never be a sweetheart.

170
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,670
It's okay to pretend to be weak.

171
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,910
I can also endure the grievance.

172
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,790
But if my friend is bullied

173
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,590

I, Liu Shiyun,

176
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,880
can never tolerate it.

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,960
Written test comes first,
and then the debate.

198
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,230
Qian Wei could finally

199
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,320
stay in the dormitory this time.

200
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,280
We haven't been together

201
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,000
for a long time.

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,550
Right.

203
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,960
Madam.

204
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,470
Smoked chicken and fried yellow croaker.

205
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,710
Two servings each.

206
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,400
- Thank you.
- Okay.

207
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,080
Hey.

208
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,790
I mean

209
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,590
we should gather together

210
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,710
but not punish the spread.

211
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,280
I am just happy.

212
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,590
But there seems to be a lot of people

213
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,760
in the cafeteria today.

214
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,910
We may have to
share the table with others.

215
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,380
(Liu Shiyun)

216
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,000
Tang Lyu is there.

217
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,960
Shall we share the table with him?

218
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,350
No!

219
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,080
Let's go.

220
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,760
What's wrong?

221
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,150
We just quarreled yesterday.

222
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,840
If I share the table with him,

223
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,280
it will be

224
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,150
super hard for me.

225
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,230
Let's pack up

226
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,960
and go back to the dormitory to eat.

227
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,440
Okay.

228
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
What did Qian Wei say?

229
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,350
(Qian Wei)
(Have you found a seat?)

230
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,080
(I am coming.)

231
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,840
(I'm starving.)

232
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,910
She said she is starving.

233
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Lu Xun is there.

234
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,200
What about sharing the table with him?

235
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,760
Okay.

236
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,550
Let me ask.

237
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,960
We've found a place.

238
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,760
We have to share the table with Lu Xun.

239
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,820
(Qian Wei)

240
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,150
(I have a sudden stomachache.)

241
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,470
(I may have caught a cold.)

242
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,840
(Shall we go back to the dorm to eat?)

243
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,760
What happened

244
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,030
to them?

245
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,200
So are we going to

246
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,520
pack up back to the dormitory

247
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,840
or eat here?

248
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,350
Let's do this.

249
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,590
One for pack-up.

250
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,350
And one

251
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,790
for information.

252
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
Food bribery.

253
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,440
What's the matter with you and Qian Wei?

254
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,400
Let's talk about it.

255
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,230
Professor.

256
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,230
(2011 "Mock Court" written test,
second test transcript)

257
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,520
This is the transcript
of the written test.

258
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Lu Xun took the first place.

259
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,320
Qian Wei came in second.

260
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,760
The latter trailed

261
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,520
by three points.

262
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,710
It looks fine.

263
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,520
But in fact,

264
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,200
this is not up to their usual level.

265
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,350
Lu Xun has always been rigorous,

266
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,310
but he quoted the wrong law
in the written test.

267
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,950
Qian Wei is the most flexible

268
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
in mastering the subject.

269
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,680
But she chose the wrong direction

270
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,230
on the second try.

271
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,760
What's the matter with them?

272
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,710
Chongwen.

273
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,590
You haven't been

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,880
in a good state lately either.

275
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,830
What are you thinking about?

276
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,110
Sorry.

277
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,640
Professor.

278
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,000
I will take the time

279
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
to adjust my state.

280
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,110
Lu Xun and Qian Wei

281
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,000
led the team to win eight consecutive games
when they were freshmen.

282
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,190
Now they're going to

283
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,350
attend the mock court final

284
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,280
to determine the best individual.

285
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,950
The final represents

286
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,950
the level of Law Department 2011

287
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,110
and the quality

288
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,950
of Guanghua Law Department.

289
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,280
But now

290
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,640
Qian Wei runs away

291
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,760
when she sees Lu Xun,

292
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,520
while Lu Xun chases after her.

293
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,880
How is this game going?

294
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,880
What will the school leaders think?

295
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,710
Is this what my students are like?

296
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,760
Professor Zhang.

297
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,590
Maybe Qian Wei

298
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,400
likes to

299
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,560
play with boys,

300
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,430
so it affects the game.

301
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
But never mind.

302
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,000
I will ask her

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,040
to pay more attention.

304
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,520
No need.

305
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,760
Professor Zhang.

306
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,880
Qian Wei is fine.

307
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,110
In the pre-match tutoring tomorrow,

308
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,400
I will teach Qian Wei

309
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,400
and Yu Tian will teach Lu Xun.

310
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,520
While we

311
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,160
improve their strength,

312
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
we will also provide
psychological counseling for them.

313
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,880
We will definitely make them

314
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,190
look their best.

315
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,230
I promise

316
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,520
it will be

317
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,880
a good game.

318
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,520
Wish it would be like you said.

319
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,590
(At 5:00 PM,)

320
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,950
(Room 501, Guanghua Building,)

321
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,920
(Chongwen will give you
pre-match counseling.)

322
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,190
(I will tutor Lu Xun.)

323
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,520
(Right in 502, the opposite room.)

324
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,800
What's going on?

325
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,560
My ex-boyfriend tutors me.

326
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,070
My ex-boss fell in love with me.

327
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,310
I…

328
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,800
I'm in a dilemma.

329
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,040
Why should I

330
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,950
turn the tables?

331
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,520
I should live a good life.

332
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,270
Hello.

333
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,040
Senior.

334
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,760
Can we not make up lessons?

335
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,430
Actually I…

336
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,160
I can admit defeat.

337
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,190
I mean it.

338
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,760
I know you feel embarrassed to see me.

339
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,880
Look back.

340
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,560
What's this?

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,350
So cute.

342
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,950
And then...

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,310
Look.

344
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,880
It…

345
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,760
Here.

346
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,400
And here.

347
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,040
Look.

348
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,640
They…

349
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,000
The nature of matter

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
is the relationship between

351
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,280
people and characters.

352
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,350
And you have to understand

353
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,110
their dominance implications.

354
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,800
Understand?

355
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,280
Chen rescued the woman
who wanted to commit suicide.

356
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,350
There is the obligation of voluntary service
between them.

357
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,560
According to the General Principles
of the Civil Law,

358
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,680
negotiorum gestors

359
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,760
or service providers

360
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,000
may require the beneficiary

361
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,880
to make repayments.

362
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,830
Understand?

363
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,520
Yes.

364
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,350
What are you doing?

365
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,680
You don't have to

366
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,190
scare me like this to win.

367
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,160
What's this?

368
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,110
Why does this paper crane

369
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,560
look so familiar?

370
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,430
This holiday,

371
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,470
several law firms

372
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,280
would offer internship opportunities.

373
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,070
Take a look.

374
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,400
Here they are.

375
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,950
What's this?

376
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,880
Is he laughing at you?

377
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,760
A slow sparrow
should make an early start.

378
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,830
Good for you.

379
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,350
You are laughing at me again.

380
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,110
Right?

381
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,980
(Dear Qian Wei...)

382
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,920
He means

383
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,830
covet gains ahead without
being aware of danger behind.

384
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,560
It doesn't matter what he means.

385
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,350
The key is

386
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,310
what you think.

387
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,760
Do you still want to win?

388
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,950
I have no idea.

389
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,920
Do you remember

390
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,800
what you said

391
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,760
when you were interviewing
for the debate team?

392
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,230
You promised Professor Zhang

393
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,640
to be the best.

394
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,310
You said

395
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,430
you would prioritize your career

396
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,680
over relationship.

397
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,280
Qian Wei.

398
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,040
Look at me.

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,710
If what you said at that time

400
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,000
was sincere

401
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,430
and you do hope

402
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,710
to be affirmed by Professor Zhang,

403
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,070
you should not let anyone

404
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,800
or anything

405
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,000
influence

406
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,710
the game,

407
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,520
no matter if

408
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,230
it's me

409
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,470
or Lu Xun standing opposite you.

410
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's continue.

411
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,310
You…?

412
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,310
Right.

413
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
I am waiting for you.

414
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,070
Well.

415
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,950
What about the answer?

416
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,830
The answer is that

417
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,400
I will definitely beat you.

418
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,800
Stop playing tricks.

419
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,160
Alright?

420
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,760
Listen.

421
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,040
No matter how

422
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,920
you laugh at me and demean me,

423
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,350
I surely will

424
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,800
bring you down.

425
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,190
What are you doing?

426
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,830
Qian Wei.

427
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,190
Could you think

428
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,590
with your brain?

429
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,920
Okay.

430
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,400
When I beat you.

431
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,640
I might as well

432
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,160
tell you my goal.

433
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,710
My goal is to

434
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,310
pass the judicial exam
in my senior year.

435
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,400
Get practicing certificate

436
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,280
one year after graduating
from university.

437
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,760
Publication of three journal articles.

438
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,070
Internship at Red Circle Law Firm.

439
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,760
In ten years, I will be a partner

440
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,310
in a law firm.

441
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,040
That's it.

442
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,800
No one

443
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,950
or anything

444
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,590
can stop me

445
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,680
from achieving my goals.

446
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,470
Neither can you.

447
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,160
So

448
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,710
please take

449
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,710
this game seriously.

450
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,400
Bye.

451
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,560
This Lu Xun.

452
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,830
He just doesn't study hard.

453
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:21,800
He would

454
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,000
get Yu Tian into trouble

455
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,920
later.

456
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,230
Your dad has been doing well recently

457
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,230
and is recovering well.

458
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:29,950
However,

459
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,920
he can't be discharged from the hospital
for the time being

460
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,470
and has to stay for observation

461
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,470
for a few more days.

462
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,230
Okay.

463
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,920
Qian.

464
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,230
Your daughter came to see you.

465
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,400
Qian.

466
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,400
Where is he?

467
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,880
Nurse!

468
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,830
What are you doing?

469
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,680
You scared me.

470
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,920
Don't you know

471
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
how long your legs are?

472
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,830
Are you like this for cosplay

473
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,400
or drag party?

474
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,040
Hurry down.

475
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,350
Today is the final

476
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,520
of your Skills Competition.

477
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,070
This is a day of miracles

478
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,760
and your most glorious moment.

479
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,950
I have to put

480
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,830
the judge's wig of Hong Kong, China

481
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,880
on your head personally.

482
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,000
You've watched

483
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,520
too many TV shows.

484
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,430
We don't wear this at all.

485
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,800
I will let Qian Chuan record it

486
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,070
this time.

487
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,680
I'll have more shining moments
in the future.

488
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,310
You can watch them later.

489
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,950
Hurry down.

490
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,680
You're supposed to be at school.

491
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,230
How did you get here?

492
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,560
Head nurse!

493
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,710
Here he is!

494
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,830
Coming!

495
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,230
Get down.

496
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,000
Don't!

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,680
Calm down!

498
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,230
I just want to see my daughter.

499
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,070
Save it.

500
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,640
Just look at me.

501
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,110
Slow down.

502
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,710
Get down.

503
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,920
I left you alone for a few days,

504
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,520
so now you're escaping from jail?

505
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,070
I am not escaping from jail.

506
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,470
I just wanted to see my daughter.

507
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,110
Come on.

508
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,710
Wei!

509
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,430
I got it.

510
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,800
Just go.

511
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,280
Just perform as I were there.

512
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,430
Just go.

513
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,680
Could you make me free from worry?

517
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,640
Is this the right seat?

518
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,040
Yes.

519
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,760
Zixin, come here.

520
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,640
Hello, uncle and aunt.

521
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,760
Long time no see.

522
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,230
Auntie is still young and beautiful.

523
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,680
Thank you.

524
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,880
Lu Xun.

525
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,350
Learn more from her.

526
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,880
You are just like your dad,

527
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,000
tart and mean.

528
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,560
Zixin, come here.

529
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,230
Sit by my side.

530
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,000
It's been a long time

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,230
since you moved.

532
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,800
How is your family's business?

533
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,680
Good.

534
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,950
Lu Xun.

535
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,110
Since childhood,

536
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,310
you didn't want us to be there,

537
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,230
whether it was a competition

538
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,110
or an awards ceremony.

539
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,710
Why did you make an appointment
for me and your mother

540
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,000
so far in advance this time?

541
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,040
Lu Xun

542
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,590
always takes the first place.

543
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,430
Maybe

544
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,110
he doesn't want to tell you,

545
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,310
in case you wouldn't be surprised later.

546
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,230
Okay.

547
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,470
That's the reason.

548
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,280
Mom.

549
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,230
Haven't you always wanted

550
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,190
to see that girl?

551
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,310
She'll be here in a while.

552
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,110
It's the first time

553
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,830
I've seen you

554
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,560
so nervous.

555
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,470
What are you talking about?

556
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,190
I was checking

557
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,800
if Qian Chuan had found a place

558
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,110
to take pictures.

559
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,040
Dirty.

560
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,230
Dirty?

561
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,350
This is dirty?

562
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,470
When you see

563
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,560
the questions in a moment,

564
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,430
you'll know

565
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,070
what is really dirty.

566
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,000

567
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,040
Come

568
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,680
and sit here.

569
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,800
How is it?

570
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,950
Good?

571
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,070
Hello, uncle and aunt.

572
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,280
My name is Qian Chuan.

573
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

574
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,470
I will leave you alone.

575
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,280
I have to get prepared.

576
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,920
Okay, go ahead.

577
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,470
Bye.

578
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,560
Zixin, I am looking for you.

579
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,350
Have you chosen optional course
for next semester?

580
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,830
Would you like to sign up
for swimming lessons?

581
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,640
I can teach you.

582
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,040
I have enough credits,

583
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,230
and I don't like sports very much.

584
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,950
What about magic?

585
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,710
I don't like it either.

586
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,920
No wonder

587
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,760
you participated in the topic selection

588
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,830
and recommended yourself

589
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,040
to Professor Zhang

590
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,230
to be the hostess.

591
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,590
So weird.

592
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,230
You've never been so active

593
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,680
other than eating.

594
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,640
Understand?

595
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,680
Yes.

596
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,280
Got it?

597
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,070
Got it.

598
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,430
Well.

599
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
I can never stab people,

600
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,110
make a blunder,

601
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,280
or stir up a hornets' nest.

602
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,230
But

603
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,070
I am really good

604
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,280
at revealing the secret.

605
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,070
Deal.

606
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,470
Cool.

607
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,160
Cool.

608
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,920
As your true friend,

609
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,430
of course I have to be deeply involved

610
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,920
and witness your momentous moments.

611
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,400
Don't worry.

612
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,110
You will thank me later.

613
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,760
Dear professors

614
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
and classmates,

615
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,040
welcome to the finals of 2011
Law School Vocational Skills Competition

616
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,230
(2011 Law School Vocational Skills Competition)
jointly sponsored by

617
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,920
the school's debate team

618
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,400
and the Students' Union.

619
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,430
Today, Lu Xun,
the honor of the Law Department,

620
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,920
is about to face Qian Wei,

621
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,000
Vileplume of Law Department.

622
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,160
Nice!

623
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Are you still bored
by memorizing articles of law

624
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,310
in previous years' competitions?

625
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,110
Do you still find

626
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,830
the old-fashioned cases dull?

627
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,950
Don't worry.

628
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,710
Your concerns

629
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,710
will vanish from now on.

630
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,000
Today's final

631
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,760
will replicate the real court scene,

632
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,800
combined with
the current emerging cases,

633
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
and adopt a new

634
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,070
role-playing mode.

635
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,590
We will draw lots to decide

636
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,880
(Finals)
your opposing roles,

637
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,040
and conduct legal battles

638
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,560
and IQ competitions

639
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,000
around the test questions.

640
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,640
Two think tank mentors,

641
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,800
please go back to your seat.

642
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,350
Two players,

643
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,110
please enjoy the complexity
of human nature

644
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,000
and the cruelty of society.

645
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,880
First question.

646
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,280
You are a couple

647
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,310
about to divorce

648
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,070
with 30 million in common assets.

649
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,000
Please find out a way

650
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,520
to minimize the amount allocated

651
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,760
to the counterparty

652
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,830
to the extent

653
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,520
permitted by law.

654
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,160
Qian Wei is the wife.

655
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,310
Lu Xun is the husband.

656
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,430
Please get prepared.

657
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,590
You

658
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,760
law school students

659
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,760
study this all day long?

660
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,430
Every year,
the Vocational Skills Competition

661
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,520
of Law School

662
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,070
is open to the whole school.

663
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,590
So the topics

664
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,110
are interesting.

665
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,310
On the one hand,

666
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,350
it can attract more people's

667
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,560
attention to the law;

668
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,470
on the other hand,
it can reduce the stereotype

669
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,350
of law school students
from the outside world.

670
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,470
This topic

671
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,680
seems to be absurd,

672
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,830
but in fact,

673
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,680
it has high requirements
for the accumulation of legal knowledge,

674
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,830
the ability to trim

675
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,680
and creatively study and apply.

676
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,920
After listening to this discussion,

677
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,430
you can go home and check your passbook.

678
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,830
You will know then

679
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,430
how much I love you.

680
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,310
I don't understand

681
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,470
articles of law.

682
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,710
But I believe

683
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,590
there is no one in the world

684
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,560
who saves money better than my sister.

685
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,230
Professor.

686
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,230
I have a doubt.

687
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,070
Me and Lu Xun…

688
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,160
Pay attention to your role.

689
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
You are now Mrs. Qian Wei.

690
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,680
Okay.

691
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,310
First I'll concoct

692
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,880
a couple of huge marital loans,

693
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,430
whose creditors

694
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,400
will be my brother

695
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,520
or my parents.

696
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
I would say the money

697
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,000
is for stock trading.

698
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,350
And I would use

699
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,400
all the earnings

700
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,280
to pay off the home loan in real life.

701
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,880
The loan cannot be proven

702
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,430
to be my personal debt.

703
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,070
So

704
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,430
both parties are required

705
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,230
to share the debt.

706
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,190
If Mr. Lu Xun

707
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,760
wants to divorce me,

708
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,520
not only will he not get a penny,

709
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,950
but he will have to help me
repay the loan together.

710
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,830
The creditors are my family anyway.

711
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,350
So the beneficiary

712
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,880
is naturally me.

713
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,350
Lu Xun, please answer.

714
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,310
This girl

715
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,520
is really cunning.

716
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,280
Be quiet.

717
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,920
Who dares

718
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,760
to marry my sister?

719
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,710
The stipulations on liabilities

720
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,070
in the judicial interpretation
of Marriage Law

721
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,070
were officially released in 2017.

722
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,800
Thanks to the progress of the law,

723
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,640
otherwise

724
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,110
there will be many unhappy couples

725
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,350
who'd go bankrupt.

726
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
But this

727
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,520
is enough

728
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,160
to deal with Lu Xun in 2013.

729
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,310
My wife

730
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,070
wants to forge a debt

731
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,230
with the provisions of Marriage Law.

732
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,400
If the falsified amount

733
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
is only a few million,

734
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,160
it is reasonable

735
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,710
for household expenses.

736
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,110
But

737
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,400
there is a total

738
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,110
of 30 million in common property.

739
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,040
The actual operation

740
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,470
of using this money to
create tens of millions of debts

741
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,680
and turn it into household expenses

742
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,280
will be full of flaws,

743
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,470
and hard to get the judge's approval.

744
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,880
Mr. Lu Xun.

745
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,160
It's no use

746
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
just raising doubts.

747
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,710
You have to

748
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,830
come up with a better way.

749
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,920
Otherwise I'll still win.

750
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,760
There is a country

751
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,230
where the applicant

752
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,560
only needs to be

753
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
over 18 years old

754
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,350
without criminal record,

755
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,400
and donate 100 thousand US dollars

756
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
to the local fund.

757
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,880
After three months,

758
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,400
the applicant will be able to

759
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,350
get the passport of that country.

760
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,040
So

761
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,520
in a practical sense,

762
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,350
I would have

763
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,070
dual citizenship.

764
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,430
In this case,

765
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,230
I will register bank account A

766
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,590
in Macau, China with my new passport,

767
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,920
and use my ID card

768
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,880
to register bank account B,

769
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,950
withdraw the full amount of cash

770
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,110
through the underground bank
in Macau, China

771
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,680
and then deposit it.

772
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,640
I will claim that

773
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,230
I lost all my money

774
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,230
in the underground casino.

775
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,760
The court has no way

776
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,070
to find my bank account A.

777
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,000
Even if

778
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,800
they find clues,

779
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,000
my money

780
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,760
is overseas.

781
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,040
So it is difficult for the court

782
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,430
to enforce it,

783
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,430
and the risk of the money
being recovered

784
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,470
is extremely low.

785
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,470
I think it would be safer

786
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,470
for me to do this

787
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,150
than my wife's way

788
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,840
of giving all her money

789
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,000
to relatives.

790
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,150
They have sacrificed their image

791
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
in order to win.

792
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,430
This way,

793
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,000
it is also difficult

794
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,000
for Lu Xun

795
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,840
to get married.

796
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,120
Qian Wei is crafty

797
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,430
while Lu Xun is malicious.

798
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,600
They are a perfect match.

799
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,120
They'd better be bound together

800
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,190
to get rid of two evils for the people.

801
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,040
Kids

802
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,390
of foxy parents

803
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,800
are absolutely suitable
for studying law.

804
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,120
No way.

805
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,520
Lu Xun promised me that

806
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,760
my grandson will study medicine with me.

807
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
What a shame.

808
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,600
Objection!

809
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,120
My husband's strategy

810
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
also has loopholes.

811
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,670
Donations prior to obtaining a passport

812
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,190
must be made

813
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,600
in their own country.

814
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,560
As long as I trace

815
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,760
the flow of your

816
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,080
huge sums of money,

817
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,910
I can find out

818
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,230
your dual citizenship.

819
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,760
At that time,

820
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,600
I will report

821
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,150
his dual nationality

822
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,950
directly to the public security organs.

823
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,000
Bravo!

824
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,280
The behavior of the two players

825
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,520
violated public order and good customs,

826
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,080
and deviated from the original intention
of learning the law.

827
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,190
I hope that the audience

828
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,190
will strengthen your legal awareness

829
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,870
and prevent such behaviors
as soon as possible.

830
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,950
Two players.

831
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,280
You could play tricks

832
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,710
during the game.

833
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,670
But don't practice

834
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,800
after the game.

835
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,080
I hereby declare

836
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,840
a draw.

837
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,190
Calm down, everyone.

838
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,320
It is just an appetizer.

839
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,280
The next topics will

840
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,000
be more and more exciting.

841
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,870
Second question.

842
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,390
You are a couple who's seemly in harmony
but actually at variance,

843
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,280
and both are having an affair.

844
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,670
You are both together

845
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,950
with your extramarital affair objects.

846
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,150
Now you are getting a divorce.

847
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,080
How do you prove that

848
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,950
the other party is the wrongdoer?

849
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,710
He hasn't even

850
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,760
been in a relationship,

851
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,870
how could he have an affair?

852
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,390
Hold on.

853
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,320
Objection!

854
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,190
Judge.

855
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,000
My wife is

856
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,950
making a personal attack.

857
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,000
How can you do this

858
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,120
in a debate competition?

859
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,390
Third question,

860
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,280
you are brother and sister

861
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,080
vying for the right to inherit.

862
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,000
How to reduce the other party's

863
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
inheritance share as much as possible?

864
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,760
Fourth question,

865
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,520
Qian Wei

866
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,670
is an employee who is about to be fired.

867
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,230
Lu Xun

868
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,560
is the HR director of the company.

869
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,800
How can Qian Wei ask for

870
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,360
the most financial compensation?

871
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,430
How can Lu Xun fire Qian Wei

872
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,600
with the least amount of money?

873
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,800
For the first time, I felt

874
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,950
so dangerous

875
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,190
living in this world.

876
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,840
Qian Wei and Lu Xun

877
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,950
are neck and neck.

878
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,120
Even if one side is slightly better,

879
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,710
the other side

880
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,150
would immediately seize the loophole.

881
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,390
If things go on like this,

882
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,470
it will be hard to tell the winner

883
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,280
before dark.

884
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,470
Draw again.

885
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,840
Thank you both

886
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,520
for your wonderful performances.

887
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,080
The score is now tied.

888
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Two hours and forty minutes.

889
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,950
The Law Department

890
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,280
has never taken so long

891
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,040
to decide

892
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,910
a winner.

893
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,360
It can be seen that

894
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,470
among the students of Class 2011,

895
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,520
many are talents

896
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,080
with excellent quality.

897
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,760
Please

898
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,910
take a break.

899
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,870
Overtime will begin

900
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,150
after five minutes.

901
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,360
And we will choose the best individual.

(2011 Law School
Vocational Skills Competition)

903
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,150
Use territorial jurisdiction loopholes

904
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,800
to intercept money.

905
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,320
Good for you.

906
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,760
You thought of

907
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,910
so many dirty tricks.

908
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,950
In order to get a divorce,

909
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,910
you didn't hesitate to report me

910
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,710
and revoke my Chinese nationality.

911
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,390
You are the same.

912
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,320
How could you blame me?

913
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,230
Also,

914
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,470
could you not stare at me

915
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,470
with your eyes wide open

916
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:25,870
when you talk?

917
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,710
Why are you so fierce?

918
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:28,910
Good.

919

The winner hasn't been decided.

921
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,870
You don't need to

922
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
be in a hurry

923
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,390
to celebrate her.

many articles of law were predicted.

926
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,630
Because you

927
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,430
used them flexibly.

928
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,600
If it was someone else,

929
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,390
it'd be not for sure.

we chose.

and your questions

937
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,710
are way too simple.

938
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,430
If it goes on like this,

939
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,840
the game will be a draw

940
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,080
even for a few more hours.

941

isn't over yet.

00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,190
Could you not always

950

communicate with her

951

970
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,080
law students

971
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,000
often get

972
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,800
rejected.

973
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,710
In that case,

974
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,470
should you accept the pursuit

975
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,080
of a law student?

976
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,190
Qian Wei should imitate
a law school student

977
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,280
to enumerate their advantages

978
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,710
and pursue Lu Xun.

979
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,470
Lu Xun should simulate the pursued,

980
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,470
list the hidden dangers

981
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,000
of getting along with law students,

982
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,390
and reject her pursuit.

983
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,710
What's going on?

984
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,080
Seriously?

985
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,910
Even though If You Are the One

986
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,080
was popular back then,

987
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,320
the topic shouldn't be used

988
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,800
in competitions.

989
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,150
Professor Zhang.

990
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,430
I am against

991
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,360
this question.

992
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,560
I am at a disadvantage.

993
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,280
Why am I

994
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,320
pursuing Lu Xun?

995
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,870
Why isn't Lu Xun chasing me?

996
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,360
What's more,

997
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,760
choosing the final champion

998
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,230
with such a topic…

999
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,520
I think

1000
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,760
it's a little…

1001
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,840
Qian Wei.

1002
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,520
Watch your words.

1003
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,000
This question

1004
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,470
is from Professor Zhang.

1005
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,870
