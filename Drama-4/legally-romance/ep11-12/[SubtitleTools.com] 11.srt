1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,240
Where did you get the porridge?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,960
Extra meal in the hospital canteen.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,150
The head nurse bought it

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,920
and asked Lu Xun to bring it here.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,960
Right? Lu Xun?

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,840
If you're not hungry,

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,760
just leave it here

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,600
and eat it later.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,950
Wei, eat it.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,070
Eat it while it's still hot.
Don't waste food.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,630
(The porridge is made by Lu Xun.)

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,280
(Last time, it was also him.)

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,040
(Is he insane)

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,360
(or stupid?)

15
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,000
(Does he come to me)

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,400
(just because he was
dumped by Zixin?)

17
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:41,910
(No, it's impossible.)

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,560
(No, no, no.)

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,040
I gotta go back this afternoon
to the swimming team for training.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,840
I'll take Mom
to get the medicine first.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,720
Okay.

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,790
Just give it to me.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,910
Be careful
when using the wheelchair.

24
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,680
Don't let her another leg get hurt.

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't worry.

26
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,360
Do you hear me?

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,630
Don't just promise me
with your mouth.

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,840
Just be careful!

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,360
Tong. Tong.

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Look, your mother won't even talk

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,830
to me.

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I am too sloppy lately.

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,760
I haven't washed my hair for a few days.
It's all tangled.

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,760
My beard is so long.

35
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,950
Get me a razor.

36
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,910
I need to shave.

37
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,270
Razor?

38
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,360
You can't touch such things.

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,080
Too risky.

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,400
What if it hurts you?

41
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,120
Don't make such a big deal

42
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,680
out of it.

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,270
That old man on the next bed

44
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,510
even shaved his head yesterday.

45
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,000
That's different.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,910
We're talking about you.

47
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,440
Lu Xun.

48
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,480
Help... Help me.

49
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,800
What're you doing?

50
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,270
Can't you stop asking Lu Xun
to do things

51
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,950
for you?

52
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,910
Don't you usually

53
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,310
do the same to me?

54
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,400
You don't understand.

55
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,510
You can't spoil him like this.

56
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,160
The more you spoil him,

57
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,480
the more he'll act up.

58
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,040
What're you yapping about?

59
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,400
Hurry up.

60
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,270
Okay.

61
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,000
You wanna shave, right?

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Come on, I'll shave it for you.

63
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,800
No, no, no.

64
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,230
No, you...

65
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,760
If you shave for me,
I'll bleed.

66
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
Don't you like to shave?

67
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,440
No, no, no.

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,030
I'll do it. I'll do it.

69
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,830
Uncle, I'll show her how to shave first.

70
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,270
No need, thanks.

71
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,110
Where are you going?

72
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,190
You don't even know
how to shave.

73
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,960
Why can you ask him to do anything
for you while I can't?

74
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,390
It's only been a few days.

75
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,880
You've already felt uncomfortable
with that.

76
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,900
=Episode 11=
=The Cupid Who Got Shot with an Arrow=

77
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,980
=Legally Romance=

78
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,320
Then, you gotta push it
into your hand.

79
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,630
Wipe on this.

80
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,550
Then the next step,

81
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,030
is to use this razor,

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,880
and then, like this.

83
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,600
Shave backwards once.

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Shave below.

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,160
Qian Wei.

86
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,520
Calm down.

87
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,030
You're 28 years old now.

88
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,030
A mature woman.

89
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,670
You can't fall in love
with your ex-boss.

90
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,360
Love may cause financial loss.

91
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,270
Well…

92
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,800
Did you

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,910
wanna taste the porridge just now?

94
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,110
Umm…

95
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,830
I... I'm learning how to shave.

96
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,110
Don't say anything
that will make me nervous.

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
My beard is here.

98
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,270
Why are you putting it
into my hair?

99
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,320
Not like this?

100
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,440
You're nervous?

101
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,110
What're you nervous about?

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,200
No, no, no.

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
No, I am not.

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,670
I just wanna ask you

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,000
how you and Zixin dealt with

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,510
the two tickets

107
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,640
of Rene Liu's concert.

108
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,390
The other day,

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,760
you said you weren't interested
in dating.

110
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,320
Then why did you go
to buy the tickets?

111
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,880
You wanted to give the ticket
to Li Chongwen?

112
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,200
The tickets cost me 2,000 yuan.

113
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,510
Am I that rich?

114
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,230
Don't make fun of me

115
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,070
when you failed
to deliver the ticket.

116
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,760
That…

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,390
That porridge…

118
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,160
That porridge…
Don't take it to your heart.

119
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920
It's okay for you to date here.

120
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,270
But I have to deprive the razor.

121
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,760
Don't, please!

122
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,720
Qian.

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,480
How many times do I need
to tell you

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
to avoid bringing such sharp things

125
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,270
to here?

126
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,760
This time,

127
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,880
I gotta take it away.

128
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,390
Please don't do that.

129
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,350
Listen. I can explain.

130
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,670
Give me that.

131
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,440
No.

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,950
I look too sloppy
without shaving.

133
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,550
My wife won't

134
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,510
talk to me then.

135
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,200
After a few more times
of chemotherapy,

136
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,950
your beard and your hair

137
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,830
will fall out.

138
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,000
Your wife

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
will get used to it then.

140
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,720
Well,

141
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,320
my doctor said I'm in the early stage.

142
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,640
And…

143
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,640
Don't bother.

144
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,110
This is a hospital, not your home.

145
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,440
If you keep fussing,

146
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,920
I will go to your wife
to complain.

147
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,670
So, will my hair

148
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,480
fall out one by one,

149
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,640
or drop together?

150
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,320
Save it.

151
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,320
Will my hair grow
after it's gone?

152
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,550
Can I skip the chemotherapy?

153
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,600
The porridge,

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,350
I know you made it.

155
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,920
I saw your hands.

156
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,830
Never mind. Just go get the razor

157
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,480
and shave for your father.

158
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,440
He's waiting.

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,230
Did you get the hang of it?

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Shave?

161
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,760
We don't even have a razor now.

162
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,510
I'd better use the restroom first.

163
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Dad is now

164
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,830
in the intensive chemotherapy period.

165
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,670
Only two blood donation cards
can't be enough.

166
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,880
Hospitals can have a high demand
for blood.

167
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,320
That's why they encourage
mutual blood donation

168
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
and give priority to patients

169
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
whose relatives have a history
of blood donation.

170
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,440
But the problem is

171
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,550
athletes who are in training

172
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,640
are not allowed to donate blood.

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
These two cards

174
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
are from the two of my coaches.

175
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,550
They donated their blood
for helping me.

176
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,550
Then what can we do?

177
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,440
Now all the cards we can collect

178
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,270
from our family

179
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,390
have been used.

180
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,670
I've also asked all my friends
for help.

181
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,720
Didn't you have friends

182
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,920
at the debate team?

183
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,270
The senior,

184
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,320
Li Chongwen.

185
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,920
He seems to be glad to help.

186
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,230
What're you talking about?

187
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,320
You wanna trade your sister
for the donation cards?

188
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,550
He has nothing

189
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,390
to do with us.

190
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,600
Why does he have to help me?

191
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,270
Last time,

192
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,600
when Dad is under chemotherapy,

193
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,790
it was Li Chongwen
who, without second thought,

194
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,670
donated his blood

195
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,920
and gave me his donation card.

196
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,070
(Blood Donation without repayment)
I was so appreciative at that time.

197
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,790
As a result,

198
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,040
I became his girlfriend.

199
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,550
(Blood Donation without repayment)
At that time,

200
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,110
Zixin was Qian Chuan's girlfriend.

201
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
She brought us

202
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,230
a few more cards.

203
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,350
But

204
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,070
this time,

205
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,200
everything has been changed.

206
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,760
I guess

207
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,880
I can't get cards
as many as I did last time.

208
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,230
Let's go. Let's go.

209
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,040
Qian Wei.

210
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,110
Found you!

211
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,390
(Blood Donation without repayment)
Here's my donation card.

212
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,070
(Blood Donation without repayment)
Take it.

213
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
I was going to give it to you
at the hospital.

214
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,880
I don't know
you've come back to school.

215
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,390
You… You…

216
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,390
Why did you do this?

217
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Because if everyone gives a little love,

218
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,040
the world will become
a better place.

219
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,390
Thank you, Senior.

220
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm gonna give the card
to the hospital.

221
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,950
What're you doing?
Come back.

222
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Come back.

223
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,790
I didn't agree to take it.

224
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,480
No worries. No worries.

225
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
It's my pleasure.

226
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,480
But I can't take it for granted.

227
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,920
If I can't give you something as return,

228
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,830
I can't take this now.

229
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,230
Then, just give me something
as return.

230
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,270
Like, you can

231
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,670
buy me a drink,

232
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,640
a meal,

233
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,830
or a doll.

234
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,950
I'll take

235
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,160
whatever makes you happy.

236
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Fine.

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Come with me.

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,550
I'm rewarding you now.

239
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,270
Come on.

240
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,720
Where shall we go?

241
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,200
Here, sir.

242
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,960
Thank you.

243
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,960
The authentic Shandong chicken.

244
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,440
It's good for blood and vitality.

245
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,280
Just pick one.

246
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,000
If one

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,440
is not enough,

248
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,400
I can buy you two.

249
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,520
No, no, no.

250
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,320
It's enough.

251
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,760
Great.

252
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,110
Then, we're even.

253
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,080
You pick one first.

254
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,790
I gotta go.

255
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,230
See you.

256
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
You two were just married, right?

257
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,670
Young

258
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,910
and caring,

259
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,910
your wife

260
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,790
is pretty special and precious.

261
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,840
Yeah, she's precious.

262
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,880
She's one in a million.

263
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,590
Come on.

264
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,320
Which one you'd like to choose?

265
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,760
This one.

266
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,320
This one.

267
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,200
Okay.

268
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,790
Why don't you move?

269
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,030
What's going on?

270
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,350
Move.

271
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,200
Are you hungry?

272
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,320
Come on. Have a bite.

273
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,550
Good?

274
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,200
What's going on?

275
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,320
What're you doing? Stop!

276
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,710
Li Chongwen.

277
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,880
Which is more important,

278
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,840
the chicken Qian Wei gave to you,

279
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
or your sluggish

280
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,760
roommate's study and sleep?

281
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,840
It's just a chicken.

282
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,910
It's poultry, not a pet.

283
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm gonna go find Qian Wei

284
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,200
and talk to her.

285
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,230
Don't be impulsive.

286
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,230
We can talk.

287
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,150
Don't go to her.

288
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,550
What are you doing?

289
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,280
Give it back to me.

290
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,080
Let's put it this way.

291
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
In this dormitory,

292
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,110
either you or the chicken can stay.

293
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,550
Don't blame me for that, man.

294
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm telling you.

295
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,030
If you take the chicken's life,

296
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,670
I'll take yours!

297
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,780
(Blood Donation without repayment)

298
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,670
Surprise!

299
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,880
How did you do it?

300
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,780
(Blood Donation without repayment)

301
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,760
Twelve cards also?

302
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,960
What do you mean also?

303
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,760
Did you already know?

304
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,670
Did Zixin ask you
to give me these cards?

305
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,200
No.

306
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
Then, who did it?

307
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,350
I can't tell you.

308
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,910
I promised

309
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,790
not to tell you.

310
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,880
Okay then. Don't tell me.

311
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,590
Keep it a secret.

312
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,350
Don't say anything.

313
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,030
Actually…

314
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,910
Actually, I can.

315
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,910
No, no, no.

316
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,440
Don't say anything.

317
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,200
You've already promised someone.

318
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,030
Don't say anything.

319
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't say it. Don't tell me.

320
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,840
It's Lu Xun.

321
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,790
He asked me to give these cards to you.

322
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,710
How is that possible?

323
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,000
How is that not possible?

324
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,230
Lu Xun

325
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,200
and all his relatives,

326
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,230
and his parents' colleagues.

327
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,520
All of them donated their blood

328
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,110
in exchange for these cards.

329
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,550
He told me

330
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,960
not to tell you.

331
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
He doesn't want you
to feel pressured.

332
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,200
He should have asked Zixin

333
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
to pass these to you.

334
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,910
After all, I can't keep a secret.

335
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,760
(The eleven donation cards)

336
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,440
(were always collected by Lu Xun.)

337
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,910
(Only at that time,)

338
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,880
(Zixin kept the secret for him.)

339
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,470
(All those years,)

340
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,150
(how many times did he help me)

341
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,470
(like this without telling?)

342
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,900
(Ward No.3)

343
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,110
One more! One more!

344
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,880
Qian Wei.

345
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,550
Qian Wei is here.

346
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,960
Qian Wei.

347
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,280
Wei.

348
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,200
Come on! Get her to join us!

349
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,670
Get her to join us!

350
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,080
Come on! Come on!

351
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,000
Wear one.

352
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,910
What're you guys doing?

353
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,520
Give me! Give me!

354
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,320
We're having fun.

355
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,000
It's so funny.

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,590
Come on, join us.

357
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,320
What are you playing?

358
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
Put it on. Put it on.

359
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm not putting it on.

360
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,080
Don't you run away.

361
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,790
What're you doing?

362
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,470
We are playing Once a Thief.

363
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,710
I'm Cherie Chung.

364
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,520
Mom...

365
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,280
I portray Chow Yun Fat.

366
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,640
Dad...

367
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,590
I portray Leslie Cheung.

368
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,910
Why are you dressing like this

369
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,440
and not getting some rest?

370
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,150
You look just like an angry bird.

371
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,320
Put it on first.
You put it on first.

372
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,880
No, I don't want to.

373
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,760
It's your father

374
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,350
who's afraid to become bald.

375
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,550
To cheer him up,

376
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,470
Lu bought some wigs.

377
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,200
I thought it was fun.

378
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Just to cheer him up.

379
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,520
You look no better
than not wearing this.

380
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,590
Come on. Take it off.

381
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,320
What do you know?

382
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,760
Put one on her head.

383
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,910
No, I'm not gonna put on this.

384
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,470
Okay, Uncle.

385
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,470
I must put one on her head.

386
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,150
No, I... I don't want to!

387
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,470
Don't touch me.

388
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:47,790
I'm not gonna wear this

389
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,080
No, you have to.

390
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,550
Camera!

391
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,910
What's going on?

392
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,080
Dad, this camera is too hard to use.

393
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,110
It's going to be obsolete
sooner or later.

394
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,590
Idiot.

395
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,030
Give it to me.

396
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,200
This is what I call a camera.

397
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,840
I'll tell you what.

398
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,790
Back in the day,

399
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,110
if it hadn't been

400
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,280
in the dark photo developing room,

401
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,280
it would have been impossible for me
to touch your mother's hand.

402
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,760
Don't say it.

403
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,280
Put it on.

404
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,030
Don't just look at me.
Come and help me.

405
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,150
No, no, no.

406
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,520
I don't wanna wear this.

407
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,110
The judge's wig

408
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,150
iin the TV series of Hong Kong, China

409
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,030
would look good on you.

410
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,000
They're not treating the hospital
as their home,

411
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,150
but as a theatre.

412
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Did they just play Once a thief?

413
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,350
It seems that my grandson

414
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,350
is on his way.

415
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,110
Keep this film for me.

416
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,550
Inform the patient's family.

417
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay.

418
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,320
I went to the shop specifically

419
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
to buy this for you.

420
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,520
Thank you.

421
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,000
It's nothing.

422
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,320
That's alright.

423
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
I said thank you,

424
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,710
not only because of the wigs.

425
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,280
Sometimes I think,

426
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,080
you look a lot like this fried milk,

427
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,670
weird on the outside,

428
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,910
soft and warm on the inside.

429
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,790
It smells really good.

430
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,590
Do you wanna try it?

431
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,150
Next week,

432
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,080
my father is gonna have
the bone marrow transplantation.

433
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
Is that true

434
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
that everyone wanna start
over again

435
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,640
after one failure?

436
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
But if we do it again,

437
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,030
what should we do
if it's still dark?

438
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,350
If it weren't dark,

439
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,230
we wouldn't notice

440
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,110
that near the hospital

441
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,520
stands such a twinkling Ferris Wheel.

442
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,960
The Maya civilization predicted

443
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
that December 21,

444
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,110
2012,

445
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,440
namely, this Friday,

446
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,960
will be the Doomsday of the world.

447
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,910
I don't know

448
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,030
if I will see the sun tomorrow.

449
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,110
But due to

450
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,030
this legend
of the end of the world,

451
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,550
many people who struggled

452
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,110
for a better life

453
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,760
would stop

454
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,840
to take a break

455
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
and see the light.

456
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,960
Isn't that nice?

457
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,470
I didn't know

458
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,440
you were good at comforting.

459
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,960
Not bad, right?

460
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,440
If you don't believe me,

461
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,230
feel it yourself

462
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,030
when the day comes.

463
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,620
(Outpatient Building)

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,280
Thank you for your chicken.

465
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,470
On behalf of the school debate team,

466
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
Student Union,

467
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,760
I wish your father get well soon.

468
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,230
Wish you make progress
in your studies.

469
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
Li Chongwen.

470
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,350
The school leaders are so sweet.

471
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,830
No.

472
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,070
Don't you worry about it!

473
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,760
I didn't buy that turtle.

474
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,160
I caught it in the river

475
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,470
when I went home last time.

476
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,920
One more piece.

477
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,590
So mean.

478
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,710
Sorry.

479
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,760
That was my roommate.

480
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:41,950
This is not

481
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,280
only me.

482
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,230
The teachers and schoolmates
in the club

483
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,190
are very concerned about you too.

484
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,430
I also represent them
to give you the gift.

485
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,920
Didn't you say before

486
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,040
that I was selfish and self-centered,

487
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,800
and won't help

488
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,160
someone in need?

489
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,880
I just wanna prove that…

490
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
I withdraw what I said before.

491
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,160
It's me
who was being rude and arrogant.

492
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,830
I did not expect

493
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,400
you're the one
to turn the tide against the wind.

494
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,760
No, no, no.

495
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,000
I didn't mean to blame you.

496
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,350
Instead, your words warned me.

497
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,190
A few days ago,

498
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,190
(Qingyun Project Bursary Agreement)
I turned down AES's

499
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,190
(Qingyun Project Bursary Agreement)
Bursary Agreement of Qingyun Project.

500
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,590
Professor Wang asked me

501
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,760
to help him finish the project.

502
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,710
But I always feel

503
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,190
that this program is not that simple.

504
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,070
What about your bursary?

505
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,830
Bursary?

506
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,950
I can make it

507
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,880
by assisting the tutor.

508
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,590
When I'm free,
I can take a part-time job

509
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,590
as a legal translator.

510
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,520
I'll be able

511
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,470
to finish my studies anyway.

512
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,950
By the way,

513
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,920
let me send you

514
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,160
my picture of catching the turtle.

515
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll send you now.

516
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,980
(Li Chongwen)

517
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,180
(Li Chongwen)

518
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,000
(I believe)

519
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,310
(I will save the princess in the end.)

520
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
(Qian Wei)
(You know what?)

521
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,470
(You defeated the evil dragon.)

522
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,830
(This is much greater)

523
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,070
(than saving the princess.)

524
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
(Because the dragon)

525
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,590
(is the desire deep down
in everyone's heart.)

526
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,860
(Qian Wei)

527
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,590
(Thanks.)

528
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,680
Weird couple.

529
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,880
I've never seen anyone

530
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
who sends each other gift
in this way.

531
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,640
You are not defeating the dragon,

532
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,470
but slaughtering poultry.

533
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,160
By the way,

534
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,830
now that you've exchanged
a token of affection,

535
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,920
when do you plan
to confess your love?

536
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,710
What confession?

537
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,310
Who's gonna confess to her?

538
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,710
Get away.

539
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,000
Give me some chicken.

540
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,400
No.

541
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,160
Get away.

542
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,830
Stingy man.

543
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,430
Come here.

544
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,230
Just a little bit.

545
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,950
What do you mean?

546
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,430
That's enough.

547
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,000
Just go.

548
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,640
No meat at all.

549
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,160
Go.

550
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,040
So annoying.

551
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,920
You greedy foodie.

552
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,590
The journey
of radiotherapy and chemotherapy

553
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,310
is a long way to go

554
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,830
for your body.

555
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,640
The doctor has given you new drugs.

556
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,040
You need to eat more

557
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,190
to hold on.

558
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,520
Here.

559
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,880
Are you alright?

560
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,880
I threw up all of it.

561
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:02,920
Come on.

562
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,880
It's okay.

563
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
I'll take a break before I eat.

564
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,470
Don't talk
if you feel weak.

565
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,430
Just pinch my hand.

566
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,710
Once means "Yes".

"No".

569
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,710
Why don't you have some more soup?

570
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,760
Give me your hand.

571
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,040
What's for three times?

572
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,000
I love you.

573
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,190
My father just gave all his love

574
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,350
to my mother,

575
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,520
with nothing left for me.

576
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,160
I wanna three times' pinch too.

577
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,350
Let him pinch you.

578
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,680
How many times have I told you?

579
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
We're just schoolmates,

580
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,190
not that kind of relationship.

581
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,590
What're you doing?

582
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,520
Three times as you asked.

583
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,640
Who gave you the right to do that?

584
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,230
Your father did.

585
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,190
Why did you listen to him?

586
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,350
What's wrong with that?

587
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,920
Give me your hand.

588
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,430
Pinch her.

589
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,430
Look how I pinch.

590
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,110
What're you doing?

591
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,430
Uncle, she pinched me.

592
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,190
What's wrong with pinching you?

593
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,830
Don't you like pinching?

594
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,350
Come on, I'll pinch you.

595
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,920

The parameters are back
to normal.

599
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,350
The transplant is working well.

600
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,400
A couple of days later,

601
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,430
the patient will be ready
to leave the warehouse.

602
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,160
(Sterile Ward)
Then we will have

603
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,760
adjuvant therapy for about a month

604
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,310
and keep him in the hospital
for observation.

605
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,950
Thank you, doctor,
for your hard work.

606
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,310
Thank you, doctor.

607
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,160
Your daughter is the one
who has worked hard.

608
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,710
She had to stay in the hospital
doing massage for him every night.

609
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,400
She had to get up
at 4:00 AM or 5:00 AM every day

610
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400

612

and run from hospital to school.

613
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,000
Fortunately,
everything went well.

614
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,830
After that,
she can relax a little bit.

615
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,470
Okay, thanks.

616
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:37,920
I'm going to work now.

619

has to prepare
for the coming final exam.

620
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,920
And there's a competition
in the debate team.

621
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,350
I'm sure she can't take it anymore

622
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,640
if continuing to run
from hospital to school.

623
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,040
Why not the two of us come

624
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,310
and stay with your father
this month?

625
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
I told her so.

626
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,110
She won't let me.

627
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,800
She said

628
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,230
you're about
to have your cast removed

629
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,710
and asked me
to stay with you for rehab.

630
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,110
What's more,

631
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,310

632

633
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,520
she wanted

634
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,560
to spend the Doomsday

635
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,710

638

Your father will be discharged
from the hospital soon.

639
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
The future is going to be bright
from now on.

640
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,640
Right.

641
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,430

But I can't let you get your hands
on it.

646
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,230
It's not safe,

647
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,680
and it's not in accordance
with the operating procedures.

648
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,560
I understand. I do.

649
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,430
But I really wanna do this.

650

If I can do this alone,

651
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,560
it'll mean a lot

652
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,310

653

654

in this before.

655
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560

assist you, please?

657

Dear Qian…

769
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,520
Dear Qian Wei,

770
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,560
a prophet like you,
do you know…?

771
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,070
So disgusting.

772
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,920
That's not even like
what I'd say.

773
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,100
(I want the eyes of the eternal night
so I can only see you.)

774
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,880
It's 8:30.

775
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,950
She should be

776
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,800
on her way to the hospital.

777
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,680
Are you going back
to the hospital tonight?

778
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,620
(Qian Wei)

779
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:12,620
(I want the eyes of the eternal night,
so I can only see you.)

780
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,540
(That's so wonderful!
Best wishes!)

781
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,100
(That's so wonderful!
Best wishes!)

782
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,950
(Before I met you,)

783
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,400
my life

784
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,710
has always been bleak.

785
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,350
But for the first time in my life,

786
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,520
you're the only one

787
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,640
who has ever lit me up.

788
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,400
I know, these days,

789
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,830
you are upset,

790
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,640
and afraid of the unknown.

791
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,520
But it's okay.

792
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,470
From now on,

793
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,280
you don't have to be afraid anymore.

794
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,190
Because I will be with you.

795
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:18,830
Qian Wei,

796
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,800
will you be my girlfriend?

797
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,230
Say yes!

798
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,590
Say yes!

799
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,040
Say yes!

800
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,430
Enough, guys.

801
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,680
The world is not coming to an end.

802
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,590
Come on. You guys.

803
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,110
Delete the photos
you took tonight

804
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,880
and go back to sleep.

805
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,830
Go. Go. Go.

806
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,470
Why?

807
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,000
You don't have
to give me the box.

808
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,710
I know there's nothing in it.

809
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,070
I know

810
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,800
you wanna give me everything I want.

811
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,870
But what's weird is that

812
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,470
I don't want you this time.

813
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,630
How…?

814
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,670
How did you know

815
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,280
there's nothing in it?

816
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,190
I told you.

817
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,470
I know things.

818
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,120
I went on a walk
into the future

819
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,230
to see how we turned out.

820
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,600
It didn't turn out well.

821
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,560
Don't use this premonition thing

822
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,320
to fool me.

823
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,360
You avoid me

824
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
but you care about me.

825
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,910
You hate me

826
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,000
while you know me well.

827
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,190
I…

828
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,080
I don't understand.

829
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,470
Deep down in your heart,

830
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,150
can't you feel anything for me?

831
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm not fooling you.

832
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,040
Do you know a word

833
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,040
which means

834
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,430
extremely suffering

835
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,080
in English, French, Albanian?

836
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,120
But what's interesting is,

837
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,120
its harmonics

838
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,600
and spelling in Chinese

839
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,120
are strikingly similar.

840
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,520
It is

841
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,150
"loved (agony)".

842
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,600
Li Chongwen.

843
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,760
I loved you

844
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,080
but it hurts.

845
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,360
So now I don't.

846
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,280
No, no, no.

847
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,470
Qian Wei.

848
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,630
I... I'm not...

849
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,910
I'm not what you think I am.

850
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,950
I am who I am.

851
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,470
Li Chongwen.

852
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,320
Do you believe
in parallel time and space?

853
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,520
In parallel time and space,

854
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,190
Qian Wei

855
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,080
gave

856
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
all her dreams,

857
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,320
and her youth for Li Chongwen.

858
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,630
That time belonged to you.

859
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,800
But then

860
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,000
you smashed it
in a cruel way.

861
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,910
I don't understand.

862
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,560
Did I do something wrong?

863
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,230
No, you didn't.

864
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,840
You really didn't do

865
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,670
anything wrong this time.

866
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,280
So I'm happy

867
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,430
to see the change in you.

868
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,190
Seeing you become enthusiastic,

869
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,630
and kind.

870
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I believe,

871
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,840
someday,

872
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,560
you will become a good lawyer.

873
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,950
Thanks to your change,

874
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,040
I can reconcile

875
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,230
with Li Chongwen
in the parallel time.

876
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,000
(Why do the streetlights
suddenly get fixed?)

877
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,560
I want the eyes

878
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,000
of the eternal night,

879
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,120
so I can only see you.

880
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,760
Doesn't that refer to my name?

881
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,900
(I want the eyes of the eternal night,
so I can only see you.)

882
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,500
(I want the eyes of the eternal night,
so I can only see you.)

883
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,150
(Lu Xun?)

884
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,360
It seems that being in love

885
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,430
can bring good luck.

886
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,560
Even this street light can be repaired.

887
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,660
(Lu Xun: Are you going back
to the hospital tonight?)

888
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,120
(Are you worried
that you'd lose to me)

889
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,840
(in the final exams)

890
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,800
(so, you wanna ambush me
on my way?)

891
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,760
(Too late.)

892
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,840
(I've arrived at the ward)

893
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,950
(and started studying.)

894
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,060
(Lu Xun)

895
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,900
(Lu Xun: Okay.
Congratulations.)

896
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,470
Although I lost
to Lu Xun in the exams,

897
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,190
at least I made a wonderful comeback
in the love field.

898
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,230
Okay.

899
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:09,500
(I want the eyes of the eternal night,
so I can only see you.)

900
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,710
(Are you going back
to the hospital tonight?)

901
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,470
(So it wasn't good luck.)

902
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
(It was not a coincidence either.)

903
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
(The streetlights and light signs)

904
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,600
(were all lit by Lu Xun for me.)

905
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,350
(I want the eyes of the eternal night,
so I can only see you.)

906
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,760
(This time,)

907
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,600
(just I refused
to be Chongwen's girlfriend)

908
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,190
(and rushed to the hospital earlier,)

909
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,670
(so I can see the poem)

910
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,950
(before the lights went out.)

911
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,560
(With everything that happened…)

912
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,560
(Oh my god!)

913
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,870
(Lu Xun fell in love with me.)

914
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,840
(How come?)

915
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,320
(Then what about Zixin?)

916
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,280
(What about my plan)

917
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,470
(to win over Lu Xun?)

918
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,430
No.

919
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,560
The main purpose I came here
this time,

920
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,910
should be to turn the tide
against the wind.

921
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,630
The secondary purpose
is to be a Cupid.

922
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,190
And now?

923
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,800
All my arrows

924
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,190
were coming to myself.

925
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,630
Ugh…

926
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,760
What should I do now?

927
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,090
