1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,180
Relax.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,900
Thank you, doctor.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,020
I'm Liu Shiyun,

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,580
from Law department of 2011.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,300
- May I ask you…
- Hush.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,380
(It must be the gift from God)

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,940
(to meet a pretty gentleman)

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,020
(as a reward of my righteousness.)

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,900
I'm Tang Lyu.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,260
You can call me senior.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,580
I'm from the College of Medicine.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,020
I come to assist the clinic

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,260
in my leisure time.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,740
Hello, senior.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,740
Hello.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,860
Your heartbeat is a bit fast.

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,740
It might be hypoglycemia,

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,060
Here you are.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,740
(He gives me chocolate.)

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,420
(He must have a crush on me.)

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,580
(Shall we marry?)

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,060
(Where should we hold the wedding?)

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,020
(How many people should we invite?)

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,540
(What's the name of our child?)

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,100
What's wrong?

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,340
Don't you like chocolate?

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,780
Yes.

28
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm just afraid of getting fat.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,260
This is dark chocolate.

30
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,340
Each piece only contains
24 grams of fat.

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,860
60 percent of it is

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,180
saturated fatty acid

33
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:22,980
stearic acid

34
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,140
and flavonoid.

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,340
These won't get you fat.

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,180
It can reduce the cholesterol degree

37
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,460
in your blood.

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,460
Rest assured.

39
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,420
Doctor, doctor.

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,620
I pulled my muscle.

41
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,260
Liu Shiyun.

42
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,540
Why are you there?

43
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,420
Take a seat.

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,940
She just fainted.

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,060
It's hypoglycemia.

46
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,980
It's common for girls.

47
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,260
Let me check.

48
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,460
Doctor.

49
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,900
Don't be joking.

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,060
Is she a girl?

51
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,380
She's a Kong Kim.

52
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,340
One more word,

53
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,740
Zixin will hear

54
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,380
lots of ill comments on you tonight.

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,660
Is it so painful?

56
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,660
Wait for a minute.

57
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,740
I'll take the medicine for you.

58
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,460
So handsome.

59
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,180
To accost the guy,

60
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,020
you even feigned illness.

61
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,300
What a good guy,

62
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,980
ruined by you.

63
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,180
What a pity.

64
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,980
How dare you eat it.

65
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,260
Spit it out.

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,900
Let me go.

67
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,180
Spit it out. Spit it out.

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,980
Spit it out.

69
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,260
Are you mad?

70
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,580
(Mo Zixin)

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,580
=Episode 5=
=Life is Cruel to Me=

72
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,260
(Thanks for the invitation.)

73
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,460
(I'll be there on time tomorrow.)

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,100
=Legally Romance=

75
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,780
Let's cheer for

76
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,420
Mr. Qian Yanping's honorable retirement.

77
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,260
Thank you.

78
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,980
Thank you.

79
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,460
But

80
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,700
I have to thank Lu Xun today.

81
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,580
Don't.

82
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
You helped me a lot.

83
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,300
I have to thank you

84
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
for my colleagues.

85
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,860
The feast

86
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,060
represent my appreciation.

87
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,860
Just eat.

88
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
You're welcome.

89
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,300
It was my idea.

90
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
What do you thank him for?

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,000
Right.

92
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,800
My little girl has grown up

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,120
and been able to defend me.

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,240
This dinner

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,280
is really touching.

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,260
It was the kids

97
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,700
waiting for me to come home

98
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,700
from work.

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,600
From now on,

100
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
we have to

101
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,840
wait for them to come back home.

102
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,880
I'll take the soup.

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,520
Don't.

104
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,960
Let me take it.

105
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,720
Don't move.

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,440
Let me take it. Listen,

107
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,000
just leave the trifles to me.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,720
It's OK.

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,720
Hurry up.

110
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,120
Calm down.

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
Is it boiling?

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
Boiling?

113
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
How come?

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,800
Not at all.

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,400
It's OK.

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,280
Just sit.

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,840
I'm so strong,

118
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,600
comparable to your little brother,
right?

119
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,880
I feel the smell of barbecue.

120
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
You're exaggerating, uncle.

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,800
I'm joking. I'm joking.

122
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,120
I was busy with work,

123
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,840
and had no time for myself.

124
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,960
From now on,

125
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,240
I will spend all my time

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
on the things

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,280
I wanted to do.

128
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,040
You wanted to travel
around the world, right?

129
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,440
I'll go with you.

130
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
You one-month pension

131
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,720
is not enough for a bag for me.

132
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,960
Let alone travelling around the world.

133
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240
We can't afford it.

134
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
What bag is that expensive?

135
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Listen,

136
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,120
the boy

137
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,440
won't have a girlfriend for the moment.

138
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's just

139
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
use the money for his house.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
Well, dad.

141
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,720
Who said I won't have a girlfriend?

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,720
Give me one month,

143
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,400
and I'll bring the girl home.

144
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,880
Good.

145
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,840
Well, dad and mom,

146
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
I do think,

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,240
I have a feeling that

148
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,880
travelling is not important

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
as buying a house.

150
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,120
Let's buy the house as a priority.

151
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,660
Uncle, aunt.

152
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,120
I assumed that Qian Wei

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
only fools people outside.

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I haven't expected that

155
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,000
she even fools you at home.

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,560
Shut up.

157
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,720
If I was informed of this

158
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,440
by someone before,

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
I would be so grateful.

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,520
Hello, dad.

161
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,280
What's up?

162
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Lu Xun.

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,960
I heard from my colleague today that

164
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
he met you and your girlfriend.

165
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,720
Well,

166
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
she's not my girlfriend.

167
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,840
You haven't succeeded?

168
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Come on.

169
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
Your mom was so boring

170
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,320
and wanted to have a grandchild.

171
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,320
You know,

172
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,280
the undergraduate students
can get married now.

173
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,280
Hello?

174
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,000
Dad?

175
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,880
What?

176
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,120
The signal is bad here.

177
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,680
Well.

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
Hello? Hello?

179
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,600
What?

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,320
Somebody might diet a wrong number.

181
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you going
to chase after my daughter?

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
He? No way.

183
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,280
It's impossible, uncle.

184
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,120
I like the girls

185
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,560
with high IQ,

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,520
good and gentle

187
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,600
personality,

188
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,120
and that

189
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,440
won't make trouble.

190
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,440
What do you mean?

191
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,280
Who makes trouble?

192
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,000
No, no, no.

193
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,840
Let me explain, Qian Wei.

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
I didn't mean that you have a low IQ,

195
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,840

Dad, look at him.

198
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
You humiliate me in my home.

199
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,560
You're doomed.

200
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,000
Wait.

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,140
How can you say that
in front of my parents?

206
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,720
Beat him.

Stand up.

208

213

Good.

Right, uncle?

215
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,140
You know her weakness.

216
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,620
And you have to help her

218
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,700
How come

220
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,860
you speak for the outsider?

221
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,140
Well.

222
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,700
Not only helping her.

223
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,740
I have to pull her out.

224
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,860
Look at her brain.

225
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,180
Look at her temper

226
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,020

227
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,740

Well, I'm…

It's painful.

They're no way alike.

238

She's really

239
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,540

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
You did a good job this turn.

386
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,020
We will win this turn.

387
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
You cooperated quite well

388
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,940
for the first time.

389
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,380
Yes.

390
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,940
Yes.

391
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,900
It's hard to tell who will win

392
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,780
if you become

393
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,140
the opponents.

394
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,820
It must be me.

395
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,700
It's me.

396
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,900
Don't be proud.

397
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,380
Qian Wei.

398
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,820
Don't change the arguments

399
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,900
we discussed before the competition.

400
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,900
The opponents are not strong this time

401
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,140
and didn't catch your fallacy.

402
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
The next time we may not be so lucky.

403
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,780
Chongwen,

404
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,820
we've won three times consecutively.

405
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
How about getting out to celebrate it?

406
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,500
I can't.

407
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,380
I have something else to do.

408
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,660
You just go.

409
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,900
He's gone.

410
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,940
What do we eat?

411
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,260
How about this one?

412
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
No, no.

413
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,820
You know what?

414
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,460
This restaurant will be the worst

415
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,900
of Guanghua University

416
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,260
in the next four years.

417
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,340
How about

418
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,260
the restaurant in the crossing?

419
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,020
No.

420
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,700
The oil they use

421
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,940
is insanitary.

422
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,340
Don't eat it even if it's delicious.

423
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,460
How about hot pot?

424
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,260
No way.

425
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,900
The heavy oil, spicy

426
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,820
and salt

427
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
are bad for your stomach.

428
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
You'll know it in the future.

429
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,140
It's important to care for your stomach.

430
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,580
You denied all of my suggestions.

431
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,700
You decide then.

432
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,940
You choose what you what.

433
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,340
I, I, I,

434
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,660
I wasn't finding fault.

435
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,780
It's just these restaurants

436
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,020
you mentioned are really bad.

437
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,580
Since you're so picky,

438
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,660
how about eating fish?

439
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,140
Eating fish? OK.

440
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,700
Coming.

441
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Your seafood.

442
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,820
Senior.

443
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,780
What a coincidence.

444
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,020
Are you working here?

445
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,460
It's really a coincidence.

446
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,460
I didn't know

447
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
you would be here.

448
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,580
I should have arranged.

449
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
a private room for you.

450
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,660
Senior is really handsome.

451
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,700
You're so outstanding

452
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,820
wearing the uniform.

453
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,700
No wonder so many girls like you.

454
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:29,940
Well,

455
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,020
don't tell them.

456
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,220
If they

457
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,780
rush in,

458
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,020
senior would be so busy.

459
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,660
Well, just serve yourself.

460
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,820
Senior,

461
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,580
give us some side dishes.

462
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,780
OK, no problem.

463
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Here are the side dishes.

464
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Thank you, senior.

465
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:51,980
Senior.

466
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,060
Add water.

467
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,010
Fill yourself with water.

468
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,770
I haven't expected that

469
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,010
the most handsome guy
in our university is working here.

470
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,810
Yes, it's unexpected.

471
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,690
Mind the temperature.

472
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,250
Thank you.

473
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,130
Senior.

474
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,370
Could you add a pair of dishes?

475
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,370
OK.

476
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,810
Senior, give us a menu.

477
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:12,930
OK.

478
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,210
Here you are.

479
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,130
What do you want?

480
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,770
Flavor eggplants.

481
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,130
And fried string beans.

482
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,570
OK.

483
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,810
Here you are.

484
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,770
Check it.

485
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,450
It is right?

486
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,810
So cheap.

487
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,690
It's so cheap.

488
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,330
How about

489
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,370
your treat?

490
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,570
OK.

491
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:43,890
Well,

492
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,130
I've just received a scholarship.

493
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,370
My treat.

494
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:45,810
My treat.

495
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,810
Never mind. Never mind.

496
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,210
It's my treat.

497
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,330
You come here for the first time.

498
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,010
It's rare.

499
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,490
Thank you, senior.

500
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:53,810
Let's go.

501
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,770
Bye-bye.

502
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,250
- Take care. Take care.
- Bye-bye.

503
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,210
Sorry.

504
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,450
I didn't hold it well.

505
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,770
It's OK.

506
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:06,970
Are you alright?

507
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,610
Yes.

508
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,130
OK.

509
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,970
Sorry.

510
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,730
I messed your shoes and clothes.

511
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,210
This is the laundry fee.

512
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,690
Please accept it.

513
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,450
As far as I know,

514
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,850
they cook with dead fishes.

515
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,610
Well,

516
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,250
just look behind.

517
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,010
Let's walk backward.

518
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,810
There're lots of restaurants.

519
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,970
Let's go.

520
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,610
Do you know the punishment of libel?

521
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,690
You're deliberately

522
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,010
breaking the law.

523
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,810
Silence.

524
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,370
Qian Wei said she's guilty.

525
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,210
She decided to treat us

526
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,850
with the most expensive steak

527
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,370
in the front.

528
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,130
When did I say that?

529
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,330
I can't.

530
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,970
Really?

531
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,130
Let's go.

532
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,490
I didn't say that.

533
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:05,850
No.

534
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,730
We have to

535
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,370
pay by ourselves.

536
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,490
The girls

537
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,010
indeed have to spend money

538
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,370
for themselves.

539
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,210
I must handle

540
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:25,970
my boyfriend anyway.

541
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,130
You're born

542
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,810
beauty.

543
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,890
And your skin is good

544
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,810
Rest assured.

545
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,810
You will win

546
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,090
all kinds of boys.

547
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,970
I'm so good at catching.

548
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,490
Beauty.

549
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,090
How about trying

550
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,970
our set beautify projects

551
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,370
the next time?

552
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,610
Trust me.

553
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,730
It will be more effective.

554
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,970
Swimming pool?

555
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,460
(The message is right)

556
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,460
(He's here)

557
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,450
(I'll win him over)

558
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,850
(by the play of)

559
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,890
(Hero rescuing a Beauty)

560
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:10,850
It's you.

561
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,570
Where's Tang Lyu?

562
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,210
Sister.

563
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,850
Could you please play in another place.

564
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,730
If you drowned here,

565
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,730
the swimming pool
will be closed for days,

566
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,970
how could we train?

567
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,020
It's all your fault.

568
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,450
It's all your fault.

569
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,690
- What? What?
- It's all your fault.

570
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,850
You've feigned illness

571
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,130
and drown.

572
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,610
They're so tiring and ineffective.

573
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,090
How about

574
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,370
let me help you?

575
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,970
Are you so kind to help me?

576
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,090
For exchange,

577
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,570
you have to pry into

578
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,850
Zixin's moves for me.

579
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,210
You should be strategic
when chasing after a boy.

580
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,610
It's much easier to acquire information

581
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,250
between person of the same sex.

582
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,570
Let's cooperate.

583
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,900
Take the advantage
of a favored position.

584
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,690
It will be more effective.

585
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,210
What do you think?

586
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,970
Think about it.

587
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,810
Your bang is too long.

588
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,730
It will block your sight.

589
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,810
You'd better comb it up.

590
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,490
This is the see-through bang.

591
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,610
It will be popular.

592
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,730
What are you here for?

593
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,850
I didn't say thank you to you yesterday.

594
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,370
How about this?

595
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,490
Let me treat you a meal.

596
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,090
No.

597
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,570
I have no appetite recently

598
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,490
and don't want to eat.

599
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,730
No appetite?

600
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,090
I heard that

601
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,570
you ate up a whole chicken

602
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,370
yesterday.

603
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,850
It's a rumor.

604
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,730
Well, I'm actually

605
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,250
preparing for the election
of Students Union.

606
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,010
So, I'm quite busy.

607
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,570
How about next time?

608
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,730
I was also preparing for the election

609
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,090
at this time last year.

610
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,010
I've cleared up

611
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,850
some schemes for it.

612
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,730
I think

613
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,450
you must be running for

614
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,370
the associate trainee of the presidium

615
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,370
considering your ability.

616
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,370
I'm also the member of presidium.

617
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,210
We can eat together

618
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,210
and I'll share

619
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,250
my experience to you

620
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,490
and help you to win it.

621
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,730
(Scheme for win)

622
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,500
(At that time)

623
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,540
(I heard that)

624
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,420
(Li Chongwen's scheme was the best)

625
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,310
(To defeat Lu Xun)

626
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,310
(I'll take the chance)

627
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,590
(and be a matchmaker)

628
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,870
Well, senior,

629
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,190
is it OK if I invite someone else?

630
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,950
No problem.

631
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,660
(Election scheme)

632
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,020
I heard that many students

633
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,880
will write down the one they like

634
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,360
and attach them on the wall.

635
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,880
There's a piece missing.

636
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,000
Did they pick it off after breaking up

637
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,080
or someone else rub it off

638
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,840
by accident?

639
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,120
Let's make it up.

640
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,000
I've been wanting
to write down a name anyway.

641
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,960
People come and go.

642
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,120
What if our piece

643
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,800
is missing?

644
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,720
No way.

645
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
As long as I'm here,

646
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,360
I'll protect it well.

647
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,660
(Qian Wei, Li Chongwen)

648
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,240
Here you're.

649
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,900
(Qian Wei, Li Chongwen)

650
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,780
(Qian Wei, Li Chongwen)

651
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
See.

652
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,680
There a piece missing.

653
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,720
How about

654
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,000
making it up?

655
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,080
I've been wanting
to write down a name anyway.

656
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,480
Only teenagers

657
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,720
will do that.

658
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,960
I don't believe it.

659
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,960
You're a teenager, right?

660
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,800
My psychological age is 28.

661
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,360
I read a personality test

662
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,680
the other day.

663
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,720
It went like this:

664
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,120
If a rich girl

665
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,240
with billions of property

666
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
courting you,

667
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,560
and you have to abandon

668
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,360
your dream and the person you love,

669
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,240
what would be your choice?

670
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,080
Of course the person I love.

671
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,120
What is the significance

672
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
of a rich girl?

673
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,080
So, what's the result?

674
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,480
What's my personality.

675
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,240
Good.

676
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,440
It means you're a teenager.

677
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,680
As long as keeping
your original aspiration

678
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,800
and working hard,

679
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,200
you'll realize your dream.

680
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,000
Life is not that easy

681
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,720
as you think.

682
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Where are your roommates?

683
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,600
If they are late,

684
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
the fish will taste bad.

685
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,800
And they might give

686
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,340
the negative comment

687
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,860
picking about it.

688
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,540
Don't let him go.

689
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,600
- Let's go.
- Little boy.

690
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,840
I finally get you.

691
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,480
Don't think you can get away
from the debt

692
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,800
as your father is dead.

693
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
Everyone is an independent

694
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
civil subject.

695
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,320
If he doesn't

696
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,720
inherit his father's property,

697
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,960
there's no way

698
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,360
he has to pay his father's debts.

699
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,200
If you ask for the payment

700
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
with violence,

701
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,960
I'll call the police.

702
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,680
Who are you?

703
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,600
Don't stickybeak.

704
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,600
I've paid

705
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,200
all my debts.

706
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,960
You're now asking for

707
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,440
the illegal usury.

708
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,120
According to the law,

709
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,840
The rate of loan

710
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
shouldn't be higher than

711
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,720
four times of that in the bank.

712
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,720
The exceeding part

713
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,880
is illegal.

714
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,440
So I won't pay

715
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,200
for the exceeding part.

716
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
Are you trying to repudiate?

717
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,680
Guys, smashing the restaurant.

718
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,120
If I can't get money today,

719
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,360
no one of you can go.

720
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,360
I'll call the police.

721
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,000
Buddy, buddy, buddy.

722
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,680
What?

723
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,340
Mind your words.

724
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,220
Don't smash the restaurant.

725
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,720
It's none of your business.

726
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Go away.

727
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,560
Boy.

728
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,240
Good of you.

729
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,800
You can afford a meal,

730
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,720
but have no money to pay me, right?

731
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,800
Take care of yourself,

732
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,840
and then mind other people's business.

733
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,440
OK?

734
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,080
Well,

735
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,720
what are you doing?

736
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,840
Why are you rescuing me now?

737
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,320
Qian Wei.

738
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,320
What?

739
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,800
According to the penal law,

740
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,600
you'll receive at least

741
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,840
no more than three-year imprisonment for

742
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,720
intentional injury.

743
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
I'll call the police.

744
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
And you'll see the result.

745
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,440
Don't stickybeak

746
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,680
or I'll also beat you.

747
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,840
It's the same for threatening.

748
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,880
You…

749
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,720
I'll…

750
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
It's the same
for destroying private possession.

751
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,360
Don't you understand?

752
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,240
You,

753
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,200
you…

754
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,080
OK.

755
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,840
It's unfortunate of me to meet

756
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,600
a law advertiser

757
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,480
when asking for the payment.

758
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,360
Guys,

759
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,320
let's go.

760
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,320
Be careful.

761
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,440
Just wait.

762
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,800
(I thought he)

763
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
(only show off)

764
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,480
(by classed suit and resume)

765
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,440
(I didn't expect
that 18-year-old Lu Xun)

766
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,080
(is still so shining)

767
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,480
(even with seafood soup all over him)

768
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,480
It's OK.

769
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,680
Let me clean it for you.

770
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
I shouldn't have taken you in

771
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,840
if I knew you're

772
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,060
with so many debts.

773
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,720
They smashed so many stuffs.

774
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,800
How can you compensate for them?

775
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,200
I'm sorry, boss.

776
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,600
I'll compensate for the loss

777
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,900
according to the original price, OK?

778
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,860
How to compensate?

779
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,620
Your half a year's salary is not enough.

780
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,260
How much will it take?

781
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
Let me pay for you.

782
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,260
No.

783
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,200
I'll be responsible

784
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
for my business.

785
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,080
You don't have to do anything for me.

786
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,880
Senior,

787
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,720
since these are

788
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,120
your father's debts,

789
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,080
why don't you just give up
the right of inheritance

790
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,600
and you don't have to pay the debts.

791
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,320
My father not only

792
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,000
left me with the debts,

793
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,480
but also the family

794
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,960
and his good quality

795
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
as well as everything he cherished.

796
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,480
These are the most important things

797
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,680
in my life.

798
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
I can't give them up.

799
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,680
Exactly.

800
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,960
My family is poor.

801
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,320
But I'm not ashamed of it.

802
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,600
I earned all my fees

803
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,480
and allowance

804
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,320
piece by piece

805
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,840
by working,

806
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
part-time jobs

807
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,600
and scholarship

808
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,200
I didn't relay on anyone

809
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,000
till today.

810
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,240
So I believe that

811
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,800
only by working hard

812
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,480
can I change my fate

813
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,720
and poverty.

814
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,600
I also want to

815
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,840
bring hope to

816
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,800
more people

817
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,720
like me

818
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,600
with my professional knowledge.

819
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,960
So, don't pity me.

820
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,200
We're the same.

821
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,480
Well,

822
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,800
let me help you clean it.

823
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,720
Don't.

824
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,240
It's his job.

825
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,720
I believe he can handle it.

826
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,440
Whether the present works

827
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
or the works in the future,

828
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,240
I believe

829
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,120
you will do well.

830
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,240
As long as you keep
your original intention

831
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,720
and work hard,

832
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,800
You'll gain

833
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,840
what you want.

834
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,120
Don't worry.

835
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,360
Only three of us

836
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,000
know the thing happened today.

837
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,600
We won't tell anyone

838
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,000
after coming back.

839
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
We're leaving.

840
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,200
Let's go.

841
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,200
(Sorry.)

842
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,960
(This time,)

843
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,720
(I can't leave)

844
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
(a note for you)

845
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,940
(Election Scheme for Students Union
associate trainee of Guanghua University, 2010)

846
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,360
Teachers and classmates.

847
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,900
(Hello)

848
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,860
(I'm a student from)

849
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,220
Law Department of the year 2011.

850
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
(Election of Students Union, Guanghua University)
I'm Li Chongwen.

851
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,480
I'm here today

852
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
in wish of joining

853
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,840
the Students Union
of Guanghua University

854
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,560
and become a member of it.

855
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,360
I wish I could change

856
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,720
(Election of Students Union, Guanghua University)
the mood of

857
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,480
(Election of Students Union, Guanghua University)
pursuing score and personal honor.

858
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,240
I want to call us people

859
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,200
to pay attention to the weak,

860
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
discrimination and injustice,

861
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
And achieve

862
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,360
Guanghua University's goal

863
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
of morality and justice.

864
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,200
Why are you so slow?

865
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,200
Do you want your saver

866
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,560
being soused by seafood soup?

867
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,960
The world will really change people.

868
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
The passion
and original intentions are true.

869
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,600
But they will be worn down by time.

870
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,600
No matter how passionate the person was,

871
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,240
he will struggle for interests

872
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
with others later.

873
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,220
So, this is not

874
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,540
the topic.

875
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,120
It's the reality.

876
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,960
You're so infirm.

877
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,880
I think you're not suitable

878
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,080
for the debate.

879
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,840
It'll be me
to shoulder the responsibility

880
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,600
to build the debate team.

881
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Be silent.

882
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,200
You want to be a judge.

883
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,320
What if

884
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,840
you have to change racing track
in the future?

885
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,960
Even if you're right,

886
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,020
how about the future?

887
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,340
The reason why I fail to be a judge

888
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,480
is because

889
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,880
I want to change the world

890
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,960
instead of

891
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,860
being changed by the world.

892
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,200
Situation changes.

893
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,840
It's all up to you

894
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,080
to decide what to become

895
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
and how to get alone

896
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,240
with the world.

897
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,360
So, people are

898
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
making choices all the time.

899
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,120
(No way)

900
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,000
(I should have been a matchmaker.)

901
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,440
(Why did I discuss this with him?)

902
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,480
(Business matters)

903
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,440
Zixin.

904
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
Lu Xun's close got dirty.

905
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,360
Could you wash it for him?

906
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,440
It's because of you.

907
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,600
Why do you ask her to wash?

908
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
It should be you who wash it for me.

909
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,960
Zixin, were you checking

910
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,360
the stocks investment app last night?

911
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,720
I invest the stocks

912
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,840
in my leisure time

913
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,960
and earn some allowance.

914
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,600
Lu Xun needs money recently.

915
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,960
How about investing for him?

916
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,440
Well,

917
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,880
You owe me 500 yuan.

918
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,600
Pay me

919
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,360
500 yuan first

920
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
and I don't have to invest.

921
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Keep silence.

922
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,480
I said,

923
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,560
I'll pay you once I have allowance.

924
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
What's the point of

925
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,600
talking about 500 yuan again and again?

926
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,560
500 yuan is important.

927
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,600
500 yuan is important.

928
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,030
I will

929
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,340
pay you 500 yuan.

930
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,600
You just talk among yourselves.

931
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,360
I have some business

932
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
and come back dorm first.

933
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:43,960
Don't go.

934
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,600
Come back.

935
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,880
You said I'm insane.

936
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,960
You've gone mad

937
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,240
on the other hand.

938
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,360
You showed love publicly.

939
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,200
What's wrong with you?

940
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,720
You're returned and know nothing?

941
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
What's showing love publicly?

942
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,720
Fine.

943
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,380
I know you want to save your face.

944
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,260
I'll protect your dignity, OK?

945
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,360
But promise me,

946
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,840
take the initiative next time,

947
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,440
OK?

948
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,880
Like you to Li Chongwen?

949
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,080
Beating him first

950
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,200
and treat him a meal?

951
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,440
What's this?

952
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,240
Take the initiative?

953
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,600
You just stay single.

954
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
Don't teach me.

955
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,720
You know what?

956
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,780
I have no feeling

957
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,580
about him at all.

958
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
I just wanted to learn from him

959
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,360
the experience of electing

960
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
and ask for support.

961
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,800
Are you preparing for the election

962
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
of Students Union associate trainee?

963
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,200
Let me tell you a secret.

964
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,840
A top secret.

965
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,840
Civilian Lu Xun,

966
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,240
I'm the predictor.

967
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,120
So I'll win.

968
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,840
Bye-bye.

969
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,720
Qian Wei.

970
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,240
(I have to work harder)

971
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,080
(to be a matchmaker for Lu Xun)

972
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,480
(An 18-year-old boy)

973
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,720
(fall in love)

974
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,480
(and has no time to mind the business)

975
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,720
(I'll win the election)

976
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,600
(It's said that students here)

977
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
(will go to the roller-skating rink
on the weekends)

978
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,720
(Let's compete fairly)

979
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,680
(Tomorrow afternoon,)

980
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,200
(let's canvass here)

981
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,460
(Lu Xun)

982
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,080
Zixin,

983
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,080
Lu Xun asks you

984
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,800
to skate tomorrow.

985
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,720
Are you available?

986
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,440
OK.

987
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,160
I'm available tomorrow.

988
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,600
OK.

989
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,840
(Roller skating rink)

990
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,000
(is the perfect place to date)

991
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,840
(which has been verified by practice.)

992
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,720
(Lu Xun)

993
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,440
(I've done everything I can)

994
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,960
(Just give in)

995
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
(to your fate)

996
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,600
Do you bring the stuff?

997
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Yes.

998
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,160
Let's begin.

999
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,240
OK.

1000
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,080
Where's Old Liu?

1001
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,160
I'm Old Liu.

1002
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,840
Why do you look like this?

1003
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,320
Let it go.

1004
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,120
I found the custom-made model from

1005
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,640
the browsing history

1006
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,640
In target person's computer.

1007
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,240
It can help you

1008
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,920
prevent the date.

1009
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,000
Where're mine?

1010
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,680
The target person
is practicing acupuncture recently.

1011
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,920
He practices on everyone he meets.

1012
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,840
People all hide from him.

1013
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,800
It's the perfect time to take actions.

1014
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,120
I've prepared mustard for you.

1015
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,020
(Mustard)

1016
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
One bite

1017
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,500
will make you a tender cat.

1018
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,000
He will be attracted

1019
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,600
by you immediately.

1020
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,200
But it's a bit painful.

1021
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,800
Are you afraid?

1022
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,920
It's just acupuncture.

1023
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm not afraid of anything.

1024
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,880
Succeed,

1025
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
no failure.

1026
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Qian Chuan.

1027
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,640
The mustard is unnecessary.

1028
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,160
My true feeling will be enough.

1029
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,000
Sorry.

1030
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,400
This is the junction of

1031
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
nerve trunk and ending.

1032
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,480
Does it hurt?

1033
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,960
You're working for

1034
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,160
human's medical career.

1035
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,880
It's so great.

1036
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,920
I'm so happy to

1037
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,120
be able to help you.

1038
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,000
I just have to eat come strawberry cakes

1039
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,120
to ease the pain.

1040
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,920
You quite know it.

1041
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,080
The sugar in strawberry cakes

1042
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,680
can promote

1043
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,640
the release of dopamine.

1044
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,120
It can also

1045
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,160
ease the pain to some degree.

1046
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,480
When it's done,

1047
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,680
I'll take you to eat.

1048
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,560
Zixin,

1049
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,080
you're here.

1050
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,440
See.

1051
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,600
This is for you.

1052
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,120
Thank you.

1053
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,360
(Now,)

1054
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,720
(Lu Xun and Mo Zixin)

1055
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,160
(might have met.)

1056
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,800
(After returning the cloth)

1057
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
(I can go canvass by myself)

1058
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,960
Uncle.

1059
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,880
This is for

1060
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,920
Lu Xun of Law Department.

1061
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,640
There're so many people here.

1062
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,160
Who is the one?

1063
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,920
It's easy to recognize him.

1064
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,320
He is of this high,

1065
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,560
and is dark.

1066
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,360
But his heart is darker than his face.

1067
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,080
His eyes

1068
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,320
are like this.

1069
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,080
And his hairs

1070
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,960
are stretched out.

1071
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,800
You know,

1072
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,920
just like the rooster
with feather stretching out.

1073
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,640
Is it him?

1074
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,240
Well,

1075
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,640
why are you here?

1076
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,320
Why am I here?

1077
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,640
There're not only problems

1078
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,600
with your eyes,

1079
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,400
but problems

1080
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,320
with your mind.

1081
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,240
Open your eyes

1082
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,400
and watch.

1083
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,360
This is dormitory for boys.

1084
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,640
I know it's dormitory for boys.

1085
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Haven't you received

1086
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
my message?

1087
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,320
My phone is

1088
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,800
cut off.

1089
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,840
What did you send?

1090
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,160
You didn't seize the chance.

1091
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,920
It's not important.

1092
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,120
I just wanted to invite

1093
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,080
you to canvass
in the roller-skating rink.

1094
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,400
It's OK you haven't been there.

1095
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,160
There's still time.

1096
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,480
Let's go now.

1097
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
No, I can't skate.

1098
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,440
Never mind.

1099
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,920
I can.

1100
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,640
Let me teach you. Let's go.

1101
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:13,920
No.

1102
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,720
Let's go now.

1103
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,800
Well ,can you?

1104
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Let me teach you.

1105
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,840
Uncle,

1106
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
we just leave the clothes here.

1107
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,640
Hurry up.

1108
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,160
Well, Qian Chuan,

1109
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,400
why are you there?

1110
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
Where are you going?

1111
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,400
Well,

1112
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,560
you said

1113
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,840
we can win over 200 votes

1114
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,720
in roller skating rink.

1115
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,800
There're only two students from

1116
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,840
Guanghua University.

1117
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Don't waste time here.

1118
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,600
Let's come back to school.

1119
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,160
Please.

1120
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,400
What are you thinking about?

1121
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,160
Zixin

1122
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,000
just entitled the first beauty of

1123
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,640
Guanghua University.

1124
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,240
If you ask her to canvass for you,

1125
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,160
you can win over 500 votes

1126
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,720
let alone 200.

1127
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Let's

1128
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,400
just

1129
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
compete fairly.

1130
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,600
Qian Chuan

1131
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,880
and Physical Department

1132
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,440
will vote for me anyway.

1133
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,640
The backup team of Mo Zixin

1134
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,880
will vote for you.

1135
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,720
And we can compete

1136
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,400
formally and fairly.

1137
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,640
Therefore,

1138
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,480
you should show some sincerity.

1139
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,860
(Skating: 25 yuan for 40 minutes)
(Skating: 50 yuan for one hour)

1140
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,640
I owe you money anyway.

1141
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,320
Don't try to

1142
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,360
profit from me.

1143
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,640
OK. OK.

1144
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,360
Sir,

1145
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,920
Two pairs of shoes of

1146
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,800
37 and 42 respectively.

1147
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,560
How do you know my size of shoes?

1148
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,080
Who am I?

1149
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
Let alone the size of shoes,

1150
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,840
I know everything about you.

1151
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,800
Are you…

1152
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,360
OK, this is yours.

1153
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
This is mine.

1154
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,920
Here you are.

1155
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,400
Go, go, go.

1156
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1157
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Don't be nervous.

1158
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,400
Like this.

1159
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,160
Lower down your weight.

1160
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,880
Bend your legs.

1161
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,360
OK. OK.

1162
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,840
Go, just like this.

1163
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
No, don't…

1164
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,320
It's OK. Come on.

1165
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:03,880
Come on.

1166
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,600
Get up.

1167
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,600
OK.

1168
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,920
Stand up.

1169
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,640
Time is limited and the task is heavy.

1170
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,160
Well,

1171
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
let me push you.

1172
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,600
- I can't. What to do?
- It's OK.

1173
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,160
Stand up.

1174
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,680
Stand straight.

1175
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,120
OK, move forward.

1176
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,720
One, two, three.

1177
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,840
Go.

1178
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,440
Why do you push in this way?

1179
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,080
I can't.

1180
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,720
Why do you always push me, Qian Wei?

1181
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,080
It's OK.

1182
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,920
We can catch up with him.

1183
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,880
How about this.

1184
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,240
Go, go, go.

1185
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,920
Quickly. Quickly. Quickly.

1186
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,000
Hurry up.

1187
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,600
Come here.

1188
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,440
Move forward.

1189
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,120
What are you doing?

1190
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,000
Well.

1191
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,120
Don't be with her.

1192
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,880
Come here. Come here.

1193
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,920
Come to me.

1194
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,400
Slow down.

1195
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,200
She can't.

1196
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,840
What are you doing?

1197
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,560
Never mind. You two enjoy it.

1198
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,000
Let it go.

1199
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,640
You,

1200
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,880
come back.

1201
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,240
No.

1202
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh my God.

1203
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,400
Can you stand straight?

1204
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,080
I can't. What to do?

1205
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,920
Just wait.

1206
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,240
Stand up.

1207
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
What are you doing?

1208
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,080
Stand by yourself.

1209
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,600
Stand up.

1210
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,120
Ready.

1211
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,720
Well.

1212
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,640
One, two, three, go.

1213
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,640
Qian Wei, I haven't learnt it.

1214
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,120
Zixin, wait a minute.

1215
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,640
OK.

1216
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,000
Lu Xun.

1217
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,400
How about skating together.

1218
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,360
I can't.

1219
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,160
I was like that.

1220
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,440
It's OK.

1221
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,920
I believe

1222
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,720
you'll be touched by this.

1223
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,160
