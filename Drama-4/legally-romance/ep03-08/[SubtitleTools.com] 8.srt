1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,359
Durian flavor.

2
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:15,199
I like this too.

3
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:19,079
I don't know if Zixin likes it or not.

4
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,479
Hi.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,159
Take two for me, too.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,719
Okay.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,719
Here you are.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,520
Get me two more.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,319
Strawberry, please.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:27,719
Thanks.

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:27,879
Okay.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,520
Well,

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
You are...

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,759
Since I said

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,880
I like strawberry cake,

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,200
lawyer Tang bought me

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,360
everything with strawberry flavor.

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,479
I have to pretend to be
a law school innocent girl,

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,560
all the time.

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,880
How much?

21
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,439
Twenty, please.

22
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,560
Okay.

23
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:46,919
Thank you.

24
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:47,560
Welcome.

25
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:49,119
Wait.

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,319
Well,

27
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,599
If Lawyer Tang finds out

28
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:56,639
that my tenderness and sweetness

29
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,400
are fake in the future,

30
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,479
will he think I cheated on marriage?

31
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,799
My coach said

32
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,400
not to fight unprepared battles.

33
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,440
This camouflage is also one of the tactics.

34
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,639
Besides,

35
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:10,879
you also have

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,680
your own charm.

37
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,519
After you get along for a long time,

38
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,959
he will definitely like

39
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,879
your other advantages.

40
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,599
Unlike me and Zixin,

41
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,959
I was so embarrassed today.

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,519
It's fine.

43
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,080
Aren't we all ready?

44
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,160
Don't girls like

45
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,360
shiny things,

46
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,919
either diamonds

47
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:31,639
or fireflies.

48
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,239
The firefly forest tonight

49
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,519
will surely impress her.

50
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,440
Are you sure?

51
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:35,919
Definitely.

52
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,120
I don't think

53
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,440
you like these things.

54
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,279
I...

55
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,040
Isn't my beer

56
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,959
shiny?

57
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,480
It's gonna be a double blessing

58
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,559
for the love League

59
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,000
tonight.

60
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,680
Believe me or not?

61
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,040
Yes.

62
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,839
Yes.

63
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,720
Deciding set tonight.

64
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,599
Deciding set tonight.

65
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,720
=Episode 8=
=Cursed Sorority=

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,880
=Legally Romance=

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,119
Go, go, go.

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,399
Nice over there.

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,839
- Take a photo.
- Okay.

70
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,960
This way?

71
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,160
Well,

72
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
it seems this way.

73
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,600
Stop shooting. We'll do it later.

74
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,880
Do we live here?

75
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,559
Huh, the one in front, right?

76
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,039
Look.

77
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,399
Yeah, that's it.

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,839
Hurry in and have a look.

79
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,000
Is this where you

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
planned to take me last time?

81
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,080
- Hurry.
- Go up and take a seat.

82
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,279
Yes, it's really good.

83
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,520
Come on, come on.

84
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:32,880
Sorry,

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
I will take the initiative

86
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,960
to tell the teacher of the student union
about this matter,

87
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,600
because I caused you to fall into the water

88
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,000
and your computer is broken,

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,119
so these bills

90
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,360
are not available.

91
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,800
It's not that serious.

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,039
Just hand it in

93
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,279
before go back to school tomorrow.

94
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,839
Just fill in

95
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,240
the report again

96
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,839
before we go back.

97
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,399
Yes,

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,800
it's not that serious.

99
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,919
Everything will be fine.

100
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,960
I can do that.

101
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,399
Isn't it just some

102
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,119
car rental fees, tolls

103
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,399
and tickets,

104
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,520
as well as meals?

105
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,720
No,

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,559
but even if I can think of

107
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:10,360
these names,

108
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,199
I can't think of

109
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,880
these specific figures.

110
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,200
Let me do it.

111
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:21,839
Come on,

112
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,079
Our food bills

113
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
are too trivial.

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
If I remember correctly,

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,799
there is money

116
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,320
for two meals in the morning and evening,

117
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,119
and then

118
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,519
there is money for a night barbecue,

119
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,040
drinks

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,200
and so on.

121
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,079
And...

122
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,799
It's okay.

123
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,959
I have a backup here.

124
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,799
For these expenses,

125
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,160
as long as they are ordered in advance,

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,959
I'll back them up

127
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,720
to the mailbox.

128
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,959
Just copy them.

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
For breakfast,

130
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,279
I ordered

131
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,760
a total of 150 pancakes

132
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,880
(2012 Law School fellowship)
and 30 sandwiches at the snack bar.

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,959
Because we bought a lot,

134
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,959
the boss cut a dollar of each.

135
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,000
Beverages are one hundred and fifty

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,079
bottles of carbonated drinks

137
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,480
and thirty bottles of dairy products.

138
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,679
Three of them said

139
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,160
they were lactose intolerant,

140
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,200
so they replaced them with soybean milk.

141
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,119
That's about

142
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,600
one hundred and fifty.

143
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,760
Really?

144
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,200
Even numbers can be right!

145
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,160
No, I used to know

146
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,920
that you have a good memory,

147
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,600
but I didn't expect it to be so good

148
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,079
that you can even remember

149
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,959
someone who is lactose intolerant.

150
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,480
I've done this before,

151
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,000
so I have experience with it.

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,440
And this time

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,679
I cooperate with you,

154
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,760
I know you want to join the presidium,

155
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,040
and I don't want to hold you back,

156
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
so I'll remember it in advance.

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,480
It's me who's holding back.

158
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,200
That problem solved,

159
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,679
the invoice is ready.

160
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,239
It's all here,

161
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:49,880
here.

162
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,480
If there is no invoice,

163
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,160
do I have to

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,559
use my own money?

165
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,239
How much did we pay for chartering a boat?

166
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,000
Five thousand and three hundred.

167
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,839
I won't enter the student union.

168
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,440
I can't afford it,

169
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:21,920
really.

170
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,200
I won't.

171
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Don't worry.

172
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,239
Wait and let me see.

173
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,399
Otherwise,

174
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,079
I'll go back now.

175
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,959
They shouldn't be closed yet.

176
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,119
I'll go back and make up the invoice.

177
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,239
Can the invoice be made up?

178
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,399
Then I'll go,

179
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,359
Let me go.

180
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,600
I've dealt with them before.

181
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm more experienced.

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,920
And in the future, Guanghua School

183
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,040
will cooperate with them in activities,

184
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,160
and he will definitely make it up for me.

185
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,720
Wait for me,

186
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,559
I'll be back in a while.

187
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,119
Thanks.

188
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,760
Where did Qian Chuan go?

189
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,720
He was eating here just now.

190
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,799
He doesn't come back either.

191
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,119
How's it going?

192
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,799
I got the invoice

193
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,959
and put it together

194
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,679
with other bills.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,399
Come here.

196
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,920
I dried your clothes.

197
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,559
Take it.

198
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,760
Thank you.

199
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,839
Well,

200
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,359
if you need my help

201
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,079
in the future,

202
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,200
just tell me directly.

203
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,880
Come on,

204
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,920
save you from saying

205
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm selfish and mercenary.

206
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,799
Did I say that?

207
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:39,679
I'm not sure.

208
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm kidding you.

209
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,399
Don't you like

210
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,600
this traitor on you?

211
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,119
Put your clothes on now.

212
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,799
One servant does not serve two masters,

213
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,200
unless it is a traitor.

214
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,040
(Zhu Gong)

215
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,200
Senior Chongwen, Qian Wei,

216
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,760
Do you want to come down and play Werewolves?

217
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,559
Come on, come on.

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,679
I'm down.

219
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,600
I'll go down first.

220
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,040
Okay.

221
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,279
Fine, I'm here

222
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,640
trying to find

223
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,920
your rival,

224
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,679
while you're so weird here.

225
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,040
Let me tell you,

226
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,119
I have already asked,

227
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,760
there is a sea of flowers over there,

228
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,399
and there will be fireflies
in the sea of flowers at night.

229
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,959
You can take Zixin there,

230
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,839
and I will hold Qian Chuan, okay?

231
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,119
I have paid

232
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:33,880
for your help.

233
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,719
That's good.

234
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,559
Where's Qian Chuan?

235
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,039
Don't worry, I'll find him now.

236
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,359
Stop it.

237
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,159
Look.

238
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,039
Qian Wei, Lu Xun.

239
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,039
- It's all waiting for us to go down.
- Come down and play together.

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Just get down!

241
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,039
Play together!

242
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,760
Just play with Zixin.

243
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,520
Yeah

244
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,479
Okay, sure.

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
It's getting dark, close your eyes.

246
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,000
Werewolf, please open your eyes.

247
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,119
Prophet, please open your eyes.

248
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,760
It's dawn.

249
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Open your eyes.

250
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,320
Lu Xun was killed by the werewolf

251
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,039
last night.

252
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,400
Does the first good man

253
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,359
who dies have the right to pour wine?

254
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,760
We can punish the first werewolf.

255
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:28,559
Yes.

256
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,400
Drink it.

257
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm a hunter.

258
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,640
I take Qian Wei and die together.

259
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,880
Why did you take me?

260
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm a good guy!

261
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm not a wolf.

262
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,280
It's no use taking me away.

263
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,039
It doesn't matter whether you are a good man

264
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,840
or a werewolf.

265
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,760
As a hunter,

266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,359
if I go,

267
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,679
I can take you away.

268
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,280
You don't have to take me.

269
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,719
I'll take you. Hurry!

270
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,479
No, you're taking revenge for yourself.

271
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:48,799
Drink it.

272
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
- Come on.
- Drink it, Qian Wei.

273
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,599
Come on.

274
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,760
- Drink it.
- Hurry.

275
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,760
What's the use of

276
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,640
taking me?

277
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,760
If you agree that Qian Wei is a werewolf,

278
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,479
please vote.

279
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,679
She must be.

280
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,960
Follow me and vote with me.

281
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,599
Believe me, and raise your hand.

282
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,880
She must be.

283
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,280
You know it, why don't raise your hand?

284
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,520
- It's not your business.
- I...

285
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,039
He doesn't raise his hand,
so I need to call him.

286
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,760
I'm canvassing.

287
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,799
I won't raise my hand.

288
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,960
OK, don't raise your hand.

289
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,960
Qian Wei,

290
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,760
You've covered

291
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
all the fine drinks this afternoon.

292
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,400
Drink it now.

293
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,320
Finish in one gulp.

294
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
What the hell, what bad luck am I.

295
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,559
Why am I always a werewolf?

296
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,799
Because your emotions are written on your face.

297
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,159
You can't be a wolf like this.

298
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Otherwise,

299
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,320
You'll be a judge in the next game.

300
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,200
No,

301
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,640
I'll be lucky when I finish this glass of wine.

302
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sure I can win.

303
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,760
Come on.

304
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,719
Come on, I'll pour you wine.

305
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,440
Senior, this is not wine.

306
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
This is mineral water.

307
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,200
You cheat.

308
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,599
What's wrong with you?

309
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,159
Take water as wine?

310
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,640
You are so interesting, senior.

311
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:06,039
Cheat.

312
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,320
Wait, wait,

313
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,479
let me explain,

314
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,359
I just saw that Qian Wei drank too much,

315
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,520
so I just wanted her

316
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,119
to drink some water to relax.

317
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,119
Or

318
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,599
I'll drink it for her, okay?

319
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,520
This game punished me for drinking.

320
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,039
No way,

321
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Qian Wei is the monitor.

322
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,840
The monitor should look like a monitor.

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,880
Admit defeat for bet.

324
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,159
You both have to drink.

325
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:25,799
Yes.

326
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,559
We law students

327
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,679
must obey the rules.

328
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,520
Drink!

329
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Drink it.

330
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Drink!

331
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,440
- Finish.
- Hurry.

332
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,679
Drink.

333
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,599
Fine, she can't drink any more.

334
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,119
I'll drink it for her,

335
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,080
or she'll get sick.

336
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,479
Good.

337
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,719
You guys,

338
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,359
You play first.

339
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:47,880
I... I...

340
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,320
I'll take a break.

341
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,799
I can't.

342
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,960
Come and play Werewolf.

343
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,359
Two more people.

344
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,119
Are you okay?

345
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:04,799
Here I'm.

346
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,919
Go, go, go.

347
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,880
Hurry.

348
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,840
Finally let us play.

349
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,119
Come on, and sit down here.

350
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,159
Come and Have a bite of watermelon to sober up.

351
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,719
Come on, deal.

352
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,520
Don't always care about winning or losing.

353
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,159
Win or lose doesn't matter.

354
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,239
The most important thing

355
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,320
is to have fun

356
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,159
with friends.

357
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,400
You drank a lot.

358
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,159
Eat it yourself.

359
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,880
It used to be the same.

360
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
Every time you eat watermelon,

361
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,200
you always leave the sweetest piece

362
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,280
in the middle to me.

363
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,719
When I am sad and frustrated,

364
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,840
you comfort me that it doesn't matter
whether I win or lose.

365
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,359
But then I found out

366
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,679
that it didn't matter whether I won or lost.

367
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,359
Li Chongwen,

368
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,520
you always want to win.

369
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,239
Then let's continue.

370
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,559
What's up?

371
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,239
Do you have a stomach trouble?

372
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,559
You shouldn't have drunk that wine just now.

373
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,679
How do you know I had stomach trouble?

374
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,440
Prophet, please close your eyes.

375
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:00,880
Huh...

376
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,479
Good.

377
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,400
You're covering your stomach.

378
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,719
It's obvious.

379
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:04,880
Open your eyes.

380
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
There are no pharmacies

381
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,719
or hospitals on this mountain.

382
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,000
Well,

383
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,440
I will borrow a kitchen from the boss

384
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
and cook you some soup

385
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,479
with red dates and peanuts.

386
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,640
You would feel better.

387
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,359
Fine,

388
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,719
Let me go.

389
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,320
He can't drink the soup you made.

390
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,200
Drink slowly and don't choke.

391
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,280
Don't look at me.

392
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,280
Okay,

393
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,080
thanks.

394
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:58,960
Much better.

395
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,239
Wait,

396
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,159
how did you know

397
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,559
I need to drink red dates and peanut soup
with a stomachache?

398
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,080
Your stomach is not good,

399
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,520
so you're not supposed to attend
this kind of social engagement frequently.

400
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,119
Slow down.

401
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,400
Don't worry.

402
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,799
My stomach feel better

403
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,919
after drinking the peanut soup you cooked.

404
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm sorry

405
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,799
for your suffering.

406
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,559
I must buy you

407
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,640
an air conditioner this year.

408
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,119
Small law firms like ours

409
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
still have to rely on contacts

410
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,599
to stand out.

411
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,280
It's all right,

412
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,359
I'll treat

413
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,320
those big bosses well.

414
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,080
Then take some cases from them

415
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,559
that they don't want,

416
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,719
and throw a sprat to catch a herring,

417
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,640
maybe we can stand out.

418
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,039
Then

419
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,080
you won't have to suffer any more.

420
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
I don't feel hard.

421
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,359
Isn't that good?

422
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,400
Let me tell you,

423
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,320
It's said that

424
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,440
don't blow the air conditioner all the time.

425
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,840
Blowing air conditioners is
not good for the body,

426
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,520
while the natural wind
of electric fans is the best.

427
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,239
Besides,

428
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,359
although it's leaking,

429
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,599
we can save money

430
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,440
and water the flowers,

431
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,919
right?

432
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,440
I am a prophet.

433
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,960
When I play werewolf killing later,

434
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,280
I will secretly change a card with you

435
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,479
to help you win.

436
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,440
Thanks.

437
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,840
But didn't you say

438
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,159
the process is also important?

439
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,359
I also want to win,

440
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,080
but it's not

441
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,320
in this way of cheating.

442
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,919
The weather is fine today.

443
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,159
Yep.

444
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,400
Look,

445
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,400
I didn't expect

446
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,599
such a beautiful place around here.

447
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,640
Really,

448
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,479
look at the flowers there.

449
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,960
Sit down.

450
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,880
Here you are.

451
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,760
What's this?

452
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,839
Acupuncture needle.

453
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,560
Acupuncture needle?

454
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,359
You come out with a needle?

455
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,479
What's wrong with you?

456
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,599
Or shall I help you with acupuncture?

457
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,439
No, no.

458
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,680
This is my gift

459
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:26,920
to you.

460
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,319
I hope your exam goes well.

461
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,079
Thank you.

462
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,319
Well,

463
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,119
Actually, I have something else to say.

464
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,280
Go ahead.

465
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,319
I've never seen

466
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,000
a guy so handsome

467
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,239
in a white coat

468
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,160
since the first time

469
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,479
I saw you in the infirmary.

470
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,719
I've always been reluctant

471
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,479
to eat the chocolate you gave me.

472
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,000
I just want to ask you,

473
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,040
will you always let me

474
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,839
be your acupuncture mouse?

475
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,760
Shiyun,

476
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,880
it's not girl's business

477
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
to confess.

478
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,599
I like you, too

479
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,560
Really?

480
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:35,479
Yes.

481
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,040
Fool.

482
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,439
From now on,

483
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,239
I'll buy you

484
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:43,839
strawberry cake.

485
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,640
Don't touch me,

486
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,079
Mr. Liu.

487
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,599
Am I allergic to dog hair?

488
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,760
Stop it,

489
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:00,680
Stop!

490
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:18,680
Qian Chuan!

491
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,839
Wake up,

492
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,400
Qian Chuan!

493
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,359
I can't. Come on!

494
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,400
Wake up!

495
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,400
God, wake...

496
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,640
What? What's up?

497
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,160
How could you be here?

498
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:34,880
Fine,

499
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm allergic to dog.

500
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,079
I don't know why.

501
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,400
I've taken allergy medicine,

502
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,599
but it's still very itchy.

503
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,880
I don't know why.

504
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,719
I can't find

505
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:42,479
Lawyer Tang either.

506
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,839
Isn't Qian Chuan there?

507
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,760
At this time last time,

508
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,239
I was allergic to dog hair,

509
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,599
so Qian Chuan took advantage of it

510
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,319
and confessed in advance.

511
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,439
This time,

512
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,479
he must have colluded

513
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,640
with Liu Shiyun.

514
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,079
She must be

515
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,079
in a tiger's mouth now.

516
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,079
Come on, no matter

517
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,119
how hard I try,

518
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,800
in the end, I was always responsible

519
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,880
for his lonely life.

520
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,359
He and Liu Shiyun

521
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,079
are not here.

522
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,920
They must have made an appointment to confess.

523
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,640
No, let's go.

524
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,520
Listen,

525
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
we must not let him succeed.

526
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:21,800
Hurry,

527
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,119
hurry up.

528
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,040
No, no, no,

529
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,520
why do you care about them now?

530
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,160
You are hurt,

531
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,439
is it painful and itchy?

532
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:27,920
- Can you stand it?
- No,

533
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,560
Listen,

534
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,439
I won't die.

535
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,079
But I tell you,

536
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,880
you'll regret

537
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,400
missing tonight.

538
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,160
I know where they are.

539
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,959
They are in the

540
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,920
flower field,

541
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,160
where

542
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,560
fireflies gather.

543
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,199
Let's take the insecticide

544
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,239
to the flower field now.

545
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:38,920
All right, stop talking nonsense.

546
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,520
Hurry.

547
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,199
See a doctor first.

548
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:41,800
Go to the hospital.

549
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,000
No, I don't need to go to hospital.

550
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,040
But I tell you

551
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,079
fireflies are important.

552
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,760
You can't just

553
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,000
leave them alone.

554
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,319
I saw so many fireflies

555
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,520
for the first time.

556
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,359
Me, too.

557
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,920
What a coincidence.

558
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,719
It's small,

559
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,119
but it's really bright.

560
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,839
Your eyes

561
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,160
are brighter than it.

562
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,800
Zixin,

563
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,920
You always wear this.

564
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,599
You must like crystal very much.

565
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,520
In fact, you are

566
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,199
as pure and beautiful

567
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,199
as crystal in my eyes.

568
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,839
Zixin,

569
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,520
I like you.

570
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,400
I want to protect you

571
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,040
and accompany you all the time.

572
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,880
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

573
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,160
To be honest,

574
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,959
the crystal is very beautiful,

575
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,680
But it is easy to break.

576
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,079
It's easy to hurt others

577
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,199
when it's broken.

578
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,079
Qian Chuan,

579
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,520
Thank you for your like,

580
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,800
but I can't promise you.

581
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,479
I know,

582
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,800
I know many girls like you,

583
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,839
and I'm not the best one.

584
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,680
If you think something is wrong with me,

585
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,400
I can change.

586
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,800
I am willing to work hard for you.

587
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,199
Is it because

588
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:44,880
I'm so embarrassed during the day?

589
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm really afraid of heights,

590
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,959
but I'm not afraid of anything else.

591
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,239
Not today, of course.

592
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Loving someone

593
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,000
has nothing to do with effort.

594
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,560
Qian Chuan,

595
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
You're really good.

596
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,839
You don't need to

597
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,160
change anything for me.

598
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,719
Just because of me,

599
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,079
because my own heart

600
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,599
has been broken.

601
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,959
I can't fall in love with others

602
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,839
until it heals.

603
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,040
Qian Wei is my good friend,

604
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,599
I don't want to hurt you either.

605
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,400
So,

606
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,959
I'm so sorry.

607
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,520
Why don't you stay with your boy

608
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,920
but come to help me?

609
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
I was busy in vain.

610
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:02,959
Sorry.

611
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,239
Stop it.

612
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,680
Just drink.

613
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,719
I thought

614
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,520
I might be rejected in fact.

615
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,319
But I'm still not reconciled,

616
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,439
I want to try.

617
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,400
I'm not the best.

618
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,920
I really don't deserve her.

619
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,040
She said

620
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,280
she refused you

621
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,040
because she had been hurt.

622
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,800
Lu Xun, the first in the grade,

623
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,599
was also rejected,

624
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:55,719
right?

625
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,560
So,

626
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,160
don't belittle yourself.

627
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,280
She said she didn't want to hurt you.

628
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,280
What does it mean?

629
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,880
It means she doesn't hate you.

630
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:05,800
I think you still have a chance.

631
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,680
Really?

632
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,479
Sure.

633
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:09,880
As a girl,

634
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,040
I certainly know

635
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,719
what girls think.

636
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,560
What the world would be

637
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,319
if fairies

638
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,400
are so easy to chase?

639
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,560
The Seventh Fairy and Dong Yong

640
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
were married,

641
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,839
but there is still a galaxy between them.

642
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,719
It's nothing.

643
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,319
For my view,

644
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:25,920
Just give her

645
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,400
a little more time,

646
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,599
Let's make persistent efforts

647
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,040
when she is no longer sad for others.

648
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,199
Yes,

649
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,199
you're right.

650
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,640
At least you have succeeded,

651
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,719
and our love alliance

652
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,359
has not ended in vain.

653
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,119
Correct.

654
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,520
That's good.

655
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,479
Great bro.

656
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,079
Great bro.

657
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:47,439
- Let's go and drink.
- Go.

658
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,160
Have a drink!

659
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,400
Drink and have fun.

660
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,199
Have fun.

661
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:50,520
Go.

662
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,920
Go.

663
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,319
Be happy.

664
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:53,640
Go.

665
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,040
Hurry.

666
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,760
Wait for me.

667
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,400
Have fun.

668
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,079
Go.

669
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,199
Don't...don't hold me.

670
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,160
(Outpatient)

671
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
(Qian Chuan: Finally, I failed)

672
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,599
Look,

673
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:12,760
Qian Chuan failed.

674
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,760
Great!

675
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,920
The fireflies in the sea of flowers

676
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,239
won't die.

677
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,040
Be careful.

678
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,239
Don't look at your smart phone.

679
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,319
I've seen the Olympic Games in odd years,

680
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,199
the postponement of college entrance examination
and judicial examination,

681
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,400
and thousands of years of iron trees bloom,

682
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,319
But I never seen

683
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,400
Lu Xun fall in a sweet love.

684
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,640
I think he deserved it.

685
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,719
It's not an allergy,

686
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,920
but just a flea bite.

687
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,319
I'll prescribe

688
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,199
some topical medicine for you first.

689
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,719
If your skin is still itchy,

690
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,599
take some medicine orally.

691
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,920
Remember not to scratch it.

692
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,880
I'm glad it's all right.

693
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,880
How about we put the dog

694
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,680
in someone else's house

695
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,319
before taking a bath

696
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
and taking medicine?

697
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
It seems that this little dog

698
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,959
has no fate with us.

699
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,360
(Prescription of Qingshan Hospital)

700
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,560
Thanks.

701
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,920
You'd better take the topical medicine

702
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,800
as soon as possible.

703
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,239
Well, doctor,

704
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,040
we live far away,

705
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,959
the places where the medicine can't be applied,

706
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,800
the back or something,

707
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,719
can you help me

708
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,400
apply it now?

709
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,000
Ask your boyfriend to help you.

710
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,640
- No.
- No, no, doctor.

711
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,119
Huh,

712
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll pay

713
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,079
for her medicine now.

714
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,280
Please do her a favor.

715
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,239
Your boyfriend is

716
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:25,599
so handsome and careful.

717
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,959
He was the only one

718
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:28,400
of the accompanying family members

719
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,800
who didn't play
with his mobile phone all the way.

720
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,439
It's rare to be so innocent.

721
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,719
Cherish him.

722
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,040
He is not my boyfriend,

723
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,160
but my classmate.

724
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,359
Then he must like you.

725
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,119
Well,

726
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,760
Don't tell the student union

727
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,319
that I went to the emergency tonight.

728
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,359
I'm afraid it will affect my participation
in the presidium.

729
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,359
No problem.

730
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,880
I'm not so free.

731
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,079
Am I gossip man?

732
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,520
Okay,

733
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,280
Your cold image

734
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,119
has finally played

735
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,479
a positive role for me.

736
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,079
Don't scratch.

737
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,359
Itchy.

738
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,680
It's okay to scratch across clothes.

739
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,520
Hold on.

740
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,599
What...what are you doing?

741
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,640
You don't have one more hand
to scratch in this way.

742
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,359
If you fall,

743
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,079
I won't have the strength

744
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,319
to carry you to the hospital again.

745
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,280
No matter how hard I tried,

746
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,640
I still failed to help Lu Xun

747
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,560
succeed in chasing love.

748
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,079
Is love

749
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,479
really bound long time ago?

750
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,680
Can't ordinary people change?

751
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,560
Lu Xun is arrogant

752
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,359
and annoying,

753
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,880
But he is still very loyal

754
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,800
at the critical moment.

755
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,040
Hmm,

756
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,359
Thank you for accompanying me

757
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,479
to the hospital so late today.

758
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,239
There is...

759
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,520
there is no taxi-hailing app.

760
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,560
They didn't take our orders

761
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,079
as soon as they heard
we were going up the mountain.

762
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,079
What taxi-hailing app?

763
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,959
What's that?

764
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,319
Just take a taxi on your mobile phone.

765
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,839
You can increase the price

766
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,880
when there are many people and few cars.

767
00:29:59,239 --> 00:29:59,800
Very convenient.

768
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,079
Those are all unlicensed taxi.

769
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,599
Don't think about it.

770
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,560
What do you know?

771
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,119
Look,

772
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,160
ten years later,

773
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,920
you will know

774
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,800
how stupid you are.

775
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,000
Don't scratch.

776
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,040
Hold me tight.

777
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,880
Hold on, come on.

778
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,400
Listen me?

779
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,599
Hold!

780
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,680
Am I heavy?

781
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,800
For me,

782
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:31,839
just fine.

783
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,719
Why does Lu Xun

784
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,680
suddenly treat me so well?

785
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:39,760
No, no way.

786
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,160
It's not possible.

787
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,599
It must have been a rare occasion
for my former boss

788
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,959
to treat me well,

789
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,560
and I suffered a Stockholm Syndrome attack.

790
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:47,119
Illusion, it must be an illusion.

791
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,719
Your boyfriend is

792
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:50,959
so handsome and careful.

793
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,479
He was the only one

794
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:53,959
of the accompanying family members

795
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,319
who didn't play
with his mobile phone all the way.

796
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,119
It's rare to be so innocent.

797
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,640
Cherish him.

798
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,160
You...

799
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,040
You, do you

800
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,880
like me a little?

801
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,680
College love is not a puppy love.

802
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,959
But don't worry,

803
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,959
I'm not going to report you.

804
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,800
What the hell?

805
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,319
I only have

806
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,959
career and money

807
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,599
on my mind.

808
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,439
I don't have

809
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,560
these worldly wishes.

810
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:26,959
None

811
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,239
is good.

812
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,199
What are you doing?

813
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,599
One good deed a day.

814
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
Do you have

815
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,880
anything you like?

816
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,160
I mean something within 50 RMB.

817
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,439
I'll repay you

818
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,239
for doing good every day.

819
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,760

What Lu Xun really wants most

822
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,280
is Zixin.

823
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,439
Sure enough.

824
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,119
Don't worry,

825
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,479
I'll help you.

826
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:58,280

We Guanghua law school

844
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:58,439
(Law popularization activities into the community!)
has always had a tradition

845
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,560
of going into the community

846
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,959
to provide free legal education to the people.

847
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,640
You can take this opportunity

848
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,800
to accumulate

849
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
practical experience.

850
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,599
After the activity,

851
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,400
students who are willing

852
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,160
can submit a paper.

853
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,680
If the quality is good,

854
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,119
I can recommend it

855
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,199
to the Legal Expo magazine.

856
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,280
Only Lu Xun

857
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,040
wrote the paper in the class at that time.

858
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,520
I also despise his false positivity.

859
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,439
Who knows,

860
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,520
it was because of his published papers

861
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,839
that he got an internship

862
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,800
at the top law firms.

863
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:30,599
I'll write it carefully

864
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,160
this time.

865
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,280
Little Lu Xun,

866
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,079
I'm sorry.

867
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,319
The visiting professor leading the team

868
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,199
in this activity

869
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,079
is Mr. Wang Ruogu,

870
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,640
a well-known lawyer.

871
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,800
Let's welcome Professor Wang.

872
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,360
(Seize the opportunity to publish papers)

873
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,520
Hello everyone,

874
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:57,839
I'm also glad

875
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,280
(Fair competition for publication opportunities)
to bring the law

876
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,319
(Fair competition for publication opportunities)
into the community this time

877
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,280
with you guys.

878
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,280
It's also my first time.

879
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm not alone

880
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,880
Today.

881
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,800
It is exactly him.

882
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
And I brought

883
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,479
a Qingyun plan

884
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:13,280
- I know.
-that can help

885
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,199
- I just heard it before.
-more students.

886
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,520
The name is humbling called Ruogu,

887
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,760
but he is a hypocrite.

888
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:19,040
Just at this moment,

889
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,000
I was a little in a trance.

890
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,320
I really seem to see myself

891
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,439
among them.

892
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,120
So this time,

893
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,360
I'm not only here to tutor you,

894
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,120
but also to find

895
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,159
promising,

896
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,199
ambitious

897
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,879
and capable students among you.

898
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,159
Qingyun will always support them.

899
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,719
Qingyun will offer you opportunities to learn,

900
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,639
practice

901
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,360
and even work.

902
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,080
And in the near future,

903
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,800
I can't make

904
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,000
the same mistake this time.

905
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,919
I have to stay away from him.

906
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,159
I cannot repeat the mistakes.

907
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,719
until they set up

908
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,199
their own law firm.

909
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,600
In this activity,

910
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,520
two classes teamed together,

911
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,600
twelve people in a group,

912
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,879
and take turns to enter each community.

913
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,399
The communities of this event

914
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,040
are written

915
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,479
on the form sent to you.

916
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,760
In the first choice,

917
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,280
write one for who wants to enter the community.

918
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,199
In the second choice,

919
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:29,040
write two.

920
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,520
After filling in,

921
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
each monitor collect the statistics

922
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,520
and counts it.

923
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,120
Let's start

924
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,280
by grouping

925
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,040
according to your vote.

926
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,679
If there is another conflict,

927
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,719
then we can coordinate.

928
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,199
Well,

929
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,840
was there a delicious barbecue shop

930
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,679
in Anda,

931
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,080
Anda community last time?

932
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,239
Let's choose this.

933
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,360
We can go to dinner

934
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,600
together

935
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,840
after that.

936
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,439
Right?

937
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:55,959
Yeah.

938
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,760
Choose Anda community.

What are you doing here?

947

The senior in charge of your group

948
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,439
has something to do,

949
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:41,000
so I'm here for him.

950
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,840
I brought you breakfast.

951
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:45,520
By the way,

952
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,320
I have

953
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,719
a very important thing

954
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,840
to show you.

955
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,000
This is a classic case

956
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,719
of law popularization activities last year.

957
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,520

when you eat,

959
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,959
which is a little helpful
for today's consultation.

960
00:36:58,919 --> 00:36:59,639
Come here,

961
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,439
I have

962
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,280
a classic case here,

963
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,639
let's pass it around

964
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,040
and have a look.

965
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,800
I hope our group will be rated

966
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,639
as an excellent team this year.

967
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,239
Okay.

968
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,040
- Thanks, senior.
- Thanks, senior.

969
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,600
Fighting.

970
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,280
(we are on the way)
(Legal Advisory Desk)

971
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,600
Protect yourself, right?

972
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,560
Look, uncle,

973
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,199
It's clearly

974
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,280
written on it.

975
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,520
Have a look.

976
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,159
Okay.

977
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,399
So, the reason

978
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,479
we take this activity

979
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:46,959
is...

980
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,760
Uncles and aunts,

981
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,719
There are too many people

982
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,800
in line here.

983
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,040
I can't solve each of you

984
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,159
for a while.

985
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,239
Look over there.

986
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,280
This classmate here is also very good.

987
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
You can go there,

988
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,000
right?

989
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,479
The little girl is

990
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,439
quite silent.

991
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,959
What does she know?

992
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:12,439
I agree.

993
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:13,399
Can she do it?

994
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,600
The barristers on TV

995
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,800
are such boys.

996
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,239
Yes.

997
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,000
Good-looking and eloquent.

998
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,639
We all want to ask you,

999
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:22,479
and we don't believe others.

1000
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,840
Aunt,

1001
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,199
ability is not divided between men and women.

1002
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,679
Look at this girl,

1003
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,879
she is Qian Wei.

1004
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,560
She is our class monitor.

1005
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,320
She not only has excellent academic performance,

1006
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,320
but also

1007
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,639
has great social practice experience.

1008
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,159
The most important thing is

1009
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,120
that she has a delicate mind

1010
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,600
and can often find another way

1011
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,199
to spend the least time

1012
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,080
and do the most things.

1013
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,080
Isn't that good?

1014
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:43,760
Right.

1015
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:44,679
Okay.

1016
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,639
Let's go over there.

1017
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,239
Yes, yes.

1018
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,280
Let's split up.

1019
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,719
Okay.

1020
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:48,760
- Come on.
- Go.

1021
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,479
Come here.

1022
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,280
Hi.

1023
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,760
Hello.

1024
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,639
I'm here.

1025
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:53,840
Yeah.

1026
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
to ask about women's rights.

1027
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,439
My daughter...

1028
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,439
She is...

1029
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,440
(Guanghua University)

1030
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,000
Thanks.

1031
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:16,959
Qian Wei,

1032
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:20,520
You've been talking for two hours.

1033
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,760
Take a drink and have a rest.

1034
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,000
Thanks.

1035
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,239
I want to make a will.

1036
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,040
I'll help you.

1037
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,399
Uncle,

1038
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,159
we can help you

1039
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,120
make a will here.

1040
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,280
However, if you want

1041
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,360
Higher legal force,

1042
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,600
it is recommended
that you go to a notary office

1043
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,600
for a notarized testament.

1044
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,399
We may

1045
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,760
need your ID card

1046
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,560
and household register to make a will.

1047
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:43,879
A witness is also needed

1048
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:44,600
in the process.

1049
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,879
Why don't you discuss it

1050
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,080
with your family first?

1051
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:48,320
I have no family,

1052
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,600
and I don't need it.

1053
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
My son knows.

1054
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,399
I will donate my house

1055
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,439
and all my inheritance

1056
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,600
to the country.

1057
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,840
Can you help me find

1058
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,600
what organization needs money?

1059
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,360
I donated it all.

1060
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,159
Uncle,

1061
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,719
We still have to

1062
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,719
go in this process.

1063
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,639
I just want to donate all the money.

1064
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,439
I'm waiting.

1065
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,239
Let me see.

1066
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,120
Uncle, please drink some water

1067
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,760
to moisten your throat, and don't get angry.

1068
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:13,959
I don't need you.

1069
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:14,959
His purpose is

1070
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,040
not to make a will.

1071
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:19,959
You are doing good deeds and charity.

1072
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,120
How can you

1073
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,760
not let your son know?

1074
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,199
I told you, the kid isn't here.

1075
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:23,520
I mean,

1076
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,639
you can't make a will.

1077
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,399
We can't waste a good opportunity

1078
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:28,000
to educate him, can we?

1079
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:29,159
My son doesn't come back

1080
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,280
for half a year.

1081
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,959
How do you educate him?

1082
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,280
I'll donate all my property

1083
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,360
to charity

1084
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,040
and didn't leave him a penny.

1085
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,360
Don't angry.

1086
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,080
Isn't that a boy?

1087
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,679
I'm sure it's not as sweet as a girl.

1088
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,919
He's not so...

1089
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:45,320
so cute, is he?

1090
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,320
But look at your watch,

1091
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,040
He bought it for you!

1092
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,959
I don't want his money.

1093
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,600
He just buys things,

1094
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,879
but doesn't go home.

1095
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,959
This is false filial piety.

1096
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,840
You're right.

1097
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,239
But you said

1098
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,439
you would donate

1099
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:02,760
all your money to others

1100
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,800
without giving him a penny.

1101
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:04,719
But in fact,

1102
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:05,719
you still love him.

1103
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,439
Although he doesn't come back,

1104
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,560
he satisfies you materially.

1105
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,399
That's

1106
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,320
how he love you.

1107
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:13,959
It's not a legal problem,

1108
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,600
but an emotional problem.

1109
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,040
Just solve it.

1110
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,239
But in this world,

1111
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,159
only the father is angry with his son.

1112
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,800
How could a son be angry with his father?

1113
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,679
I won't say nice words.

1114
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,959
You don't need to say.

1115
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:27,679
Fine,

1116
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,760
you tell me your phone number,

1117
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,439
And I'll call him.

1118
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:30,520
Let me educate him.

1119
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,800
You also need a good conversation,

1120
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,000
so many things will be solved.
