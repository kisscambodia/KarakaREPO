This question

5
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,030
seems to be about games,

6
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,720
but it is actually torturing people's

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,760
attitude towards stealing.

8
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,560
Although stealing vegetables at Happy Farm

9
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,760
will not bring

10
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,920
substantial economic losses,

11
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,430
it weakens

(Does Happy Farm affect people's moral values)
of stealing.

14
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,280
If such games

15
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,150
persist,

16
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,150
such cases are bound to grow rapidly.

17
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,200
And games that

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,710
spread bad practice

19
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,790
will definitely be banned

20
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,120

21
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,630
The online virtual economy

22
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,520
will also be included in the scope

23
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,120
of legal protection in the future.

24
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,110
Whether it is online or offline,

25
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,430
theft should

26
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,560
all be punished.

Except for a few specific circumstances,

(whether the wife is obligated to repay with him)
our country's current

30
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,520
relevant laws stipulate that

31
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,240
the personal debts of a couple

32
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,360
should be turned into joint ownership.

33
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,400
As long as the debt

34
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,590
is incurred during the marriage,

35
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,270
after the divorce, the other party

36
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,680
still needs to bear the responsibility

37
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,000
of the debtor.

38
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Although it protects

39
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,590
the rights of creditors,

40
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,630
it is

41
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,790
extremely unfair

42
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,240
to uninformed parties.

43
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,120
The perfection of the law

44
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,760
requires the supervision

of the moral level.

46
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,910
I believe that someday

47
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,590
this kind of

49

(Which is more important,
love or bread)

86
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,830
Everyone knows that

87
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,720
(Love: negative)
bread is rather common.

88
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,030
But love is like a ghost.

89
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,670
Why?

90
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,190
(Positive: bread)
Because many people have heard of it,

91
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,750
but few have seen it.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,320
A thing is valued if it is rare.

93
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,470
Love is

94
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,320
something rare.

95
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,830
So I think between the two,

96
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,960
love is more important

97
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,830
than bread.

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,080
love without material things

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,270
is in a state of disunity

102
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,040
and cannot stand the test.

103
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,440
Moreover,

104
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,950
Nothing goes well to a destitute couple.

105
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,950
If you don't have

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
material support,

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,270
love can't be retained.

108
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,110
The pursuit of material desires

109
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,200
runs counter to that of happiness.

110
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,510
But no desire,

111
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,600
no thought.

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,950
Descartes once said that

113
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,720
no desire, no thought.

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,830
If people have no thoughts,

115
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,200
how can they still need love?

(Guanghua University)
What's more,

118
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,600
(2011 Debate Team Recruitment Trials)
bread won't forsake you.

119
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,320
But love will.

120
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,720
Love is

121
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,760
spiritual enjoyment.

122
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,200
Blindly pursuing materialism

123
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,110
only makes people

124
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,550
more and more vulgar.

held a girl's hand,

127
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,600
what qualifications do you have

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,510
to say that true love prevails?

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,480
You are not

130
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,390
a billionaire,

131
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,920
why do you say

132
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,270
money is supreme?

133
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,040
You will have no girlfriend

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,950
for the next eleven years,

135
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,950
and you have to work overtime every day.

136
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,790
Are you cursing me?

137
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,600
She couldn't win me in the debate,

138
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,510
so she started cursing me.

139
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,110
What if I curse you?

140
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,790
I am just cursing you.

141
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,880
So what?

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,760
We are debating.

143
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,720
Why are you cursing me?

144
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,640
Look at you.

145
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,670
Stop.

146
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,350
Time's up.

147
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,550
No personal attacks.

148
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,950
The two of you have an even score.

149
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,040
Her behavior was worse than a personal attack.

150
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Enough.

of the debate team.

157
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,390
What are you muttering about?

158
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,640
What?

159
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,480
Am I not allowed to speak?

160
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,670
I have the right to speak.

161
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,230
Then can you stop talking about me?

162
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,270
I am not talking about me.

163
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,230
All right.

164
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,270
You did a good job today.

165
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
I am a law student after all.

166
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm definitely better at debating

167
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,670
than any other job.

are strong

170
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,480
and your reactions are fast.

171
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,040
I can't wait to see

172
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
your performance tomorrow.

173
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,880
Does talent discovery

174
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,480
require exams?

175
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
This topic

176
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
should be easy for you.

177
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,610
Hush.

178
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,160
Never let anyone else know.

179
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,440
Otherwise, we'll

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,390
have to say goodbye

to the debate team.

182
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,200
I just want to

183
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,390
see you more often

184
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,270
in training later on.

185
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
The debate is over.

186
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
You are still talking.

187
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,440
It looks like I'll have to find a place

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,070
where we won't be interrupted

189
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,350
when talking to you in the future.

190
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,270
Sorry to have

191
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,230
interrupted your date.

192
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,350
It's not a date.

193
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,070
It's…

194
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,350
(If I speak it out now)

195
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,600
(My plan to change my fate)

196
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,720
(Will be over)

197
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,270
I am leaving.

198
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,720
Do you think

199
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,270
she is special?

200
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,830
Just troublesome.

201
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,000
I hope you can take it.

202
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,160
I think we should

203
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
add this.

204
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,230
What are you two doing?

205
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,390
Come to take a look.

206
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,790
We are betting on the post bar of school

207
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,600
on who will win tomorrow

208
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,670
between you and Lu Xun.

209
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,320
(The support ratio of Lu Xun and Qian Wei is 2:1)
The odds are now two to one.

210
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,230
Lu Xun is slightly more popular than you.

211
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,920
So he leads.

212
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,320
But with

213
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,350
your performance today,

214
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,790
I bet you will win.

215
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,200
Yes.

216
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,480
And I found out that

217
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,760
Captain Li Chongwen,

218
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,160
who is popular

219
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
among thousands of girls of our school,

220
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,230
has been

221
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,110
locked on you today.

222
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,510
With his affirmation,

223
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,550
you will definitely win.

224
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,950
He's just a senior

225
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,480
of sophomore year.

226
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,110
The person who has the final say

227
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,200
is Professor Zhang.

228
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Not at all.

229
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,440
I found out that

230
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,720
Li Chongwen

231
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,550
is a prominent

232
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,480
big shot

233
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,320
of the debate team.

234
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,160
No, the whole school.

235
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,270
When he was a freshman,

236
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,230
Group Wanyu,

237
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,200
the largest developer of our city,

238
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,960
illegally constructed near our school.

239
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,670
Even media exposure was ineffective.

240
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,280
Li Chongwen

241
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,590
sued them directly in court,

242
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,350
and won the first instance.

243
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,640
Since then, he become famous

244
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,710
and the pride of Law Department
of Guanghua University.

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,910
And

246
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,790
not only did the school

247
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,150
publicize his successful case

248
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,030
of rights protection,

249
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,230
but even our city promoted it.

250
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,320
Last year he led the team

251
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,030
to the national first place
in the debate competition.

252
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,790
Professor Zhang is about to retire.

253
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,520
In fact,

254
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,000
the affairs of the debate team

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
are basically managed by Li Chongwen.

256
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,910
With his support,

257
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,880
it must be you who will take over

258
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
as the captain of the debate team next year.

259
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
I can't necessarily win.

260
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
No, you have to.

261
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,350
Zixin and I

262
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,080
bet all our savings

263
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,030
on you.

264
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,150
(Lu Xun and Qian Wei's support ratio is 2:1)
You can't lose.

265
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,880
If you lose, we will lose a lot of money.

266
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,440
Yes.

267
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
Today we are here

268
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
to do assault training with you.

269
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,880
Come on here.

270
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,910
Eat something.

271
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,200
Eat something.

272
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,880
Perform well tomorrow.

273
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,230
It rose again.

274
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,670
After yesterday's game,

275
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
I think everyone should have

276
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,030
a clear understanding of the rules.

277
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,640
(Negative)

278
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,790
If there is no doubt,

279
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,470
(Does talent discovery requires exams)
we will go straight

280
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,520
to the final debate.

281
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
I have a doubt.

282
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,150
Professor.

283
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,230
I think this game

284
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,110
should be cancelled.

285
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,470
Why?

286
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,710
Because it's unfair.

287
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,520
(Guanghua University 2011 Debate Team
Recruitment Trials)

288
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,200
Unfair?

289
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,910
Before the competition,

290
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,670
the seniors

291
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,520
leaked the debate

292
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,710
to us.

293
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,740
(Report Letter
Dear debate team leaders:)

294
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
(Qian Wei)

295
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,760
What's up?

296
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,440
The prophet is going to beg for mercy?

297
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,710
Although I would love to win you,

298
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,670
it must be

299
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,080
in a fair and just manner.

300
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,590
Today, the senior didn't come to

301
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,200
invite me on a date,

302
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,910
but told me about tomorrow's debate.

303
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,150
You also knew it?

304
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,640
So for the sake of fairness and justice,

305
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,230
I hope this game

306
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,880
can be cancelled.

307
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,150
No need.

308
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,760
You have passed

309
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,710
the final test.

310
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,670
This is our final exam.

311
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,350
When two competitors

312
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,880
are faced with the same

313
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,080
unfair shortcuts,

314
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,640
the one who can uphold justice

315
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,350
and report it boldly

316
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,910
is the talent we need.

317
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,350
Congratulations to both of you

318
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,150
for passing the test.

320

This is the first time

321
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,760
since the establishment of Guanghua debate team

322
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,960
that two candidates

323
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
have passed the final test together.

led by each of you.

331
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,260
for the new captains.

Sorry.

338
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,760
I had no choice

339
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,550
but to deceive you yesterday.

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,320
Never mind.

341
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320

342

an expert liar anyway.

Chongwen, come here.

344
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,760
Don't interfere with them taking photos.

345
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,000
Come on.

346
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,550
First-time leaders.

347
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,000

350
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,350
It's okay, sir.

351
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
Closer.

Everyone should know that

353
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,790
(Captain Qian)
for a good debate,

354
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,230
not only individual performance,

355
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,030
(You perform I guess)
but also teamwork is very important.

356
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,760
Today's practice session
will be divided into groups.

357
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,520
We'll decide by the game

358
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,550
you perform I guess.

359
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,320
Let's ask Yu Tian

360
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,110
to introduce the rules

361
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,840
of the game to you.

00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,200
Okay.

364
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,000
Next will be the battle between the two captains.

365

366
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,350
And everyone should guess.

367

Three minutes time limit.

368

The winning captain

369
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,320
could choose

370
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,670
team members first.

371
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,520
Lu Xun, you first.

372
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,760
Me?

(Mouse and Cat)

374
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,110
What's this?

375
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,520
That's all.

Anyone

379
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,000
else?

380
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,470
I will say it then.

382
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,860
(Wide-eyed at the sight of money-greedy)

383
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,590
What are you doing?

384
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,110
Glance at you.

385
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,080
What does this have to do with glancing?

386
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,110
A dog trying to catch rat.

387
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,440
Everyone knows he's a dog.

388
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
But how can I be a rat?

389
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,350
You look like a rat.

390
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,150
Stop it.

391
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,670
Hurry up.

392
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,790
Wide-eyed at the sight of money-greedy.

393
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,960
Just a waste of time.

394
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,880
Right.

395
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,520
Cool.

396
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,030
Tell me.

397
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,200
You know me so well,

398
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,760
is it because you have a crush on me?

399
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,550
Piss off.

400
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,670
I told you

401
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,350
I am a prophet.

402
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
you are doomed to lose.

403
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,880
Why are you struggling here?

404
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,280
What?

405
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,320
Step aside.

406
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,590
Waste of time.

407
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,960
Insight into the boss

408
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,200
is the law of survival as an assistant.

409
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,710
I have been your assistant

410
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,320
for so many years.

411
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,790
I know you better than your mother.

412
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,670
Let me announce

413
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,590
the result just now.

414
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,350
(You perform I guess)

415
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,030
Lu Xun.

416
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,590
Zero.

417
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,520
Qian Wei.

418
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,150
Five.

419
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,840
Qian Wei won.

420
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,320
Well.

421
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,670
Liu Shiyun, join my team.

422
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,640
Zixin, join his.

423
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,440
Just go.

424
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,350
Why did you switch teams?

425
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,550
Would you like to join me?

426
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,960
Would you like to join me?

427
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,400
Switch the side.

428
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,150
Don't you want to be

429
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,280
on the same team with me?

430
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,960
There are people behind you.

431
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,200
Why do you talk so much?

432
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,550
I'm talking to my team members.

433
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,030
Did I talk to you?

434
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,670
They are no longer

435
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,520
your team members.

436
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,710
Okay.

437
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,110
All right.

438
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,910
Next,

439
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,150
Captain Li would perform.

440
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,470
The team that guesses the answer
within a minute

441
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,470
will be coached by him.

442
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,910
And the other will be led by me.

443
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,150
Let's begin.

444
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,700
(Scallop with mashed garlic)

445
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,150
(You perform I guess)

446
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,960
Four words.

447
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,230
He is even seasoning.

448
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,400
Mouse trap.

449
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,640
Eat.

450
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,520
Dig.

451
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,640
Dynamic light.

452
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,030
What's this?

453
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,840
Cumin.

454
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,790
At the BBQ.

455
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,320
Scallop.

456
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,790
Miss something.

457
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,790
Scallop with mashed garlic.

458
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,910
Bravo.

459
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,880
Don't you want me to lead you?

460
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,000
No.

461
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,150
I think it's better

462
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,400
for a boy to lead a boy.

463
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,230
You should lead Lu Xun.

464
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,470
Qian Wei.

465
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,030
Although this is a game,

466
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,320
it is also a key link

467
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,150
in selecting the leader of the team.

468
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,670
You are breaking the rules

469
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,670
by making such a mess.

470
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You are breaking the rules.

471
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:20,960
Shut up.

472
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,880
It's okay.

473
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,710
Debate team

474
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,030
is always boring.

475
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,670
It is suitable

476
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,350
for a lively girl like Qian Wei

477
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,080
to come to our team

478
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,230
and warm up.

479
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,350
Let's do this.

480
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,280
You should lead Lu Xun.

481
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,470
And I will lead Qian Wei.

482
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,910
Why are you implying to me?

483
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,350
It's your own business.

484
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,110
Scallop.

485
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,760
Senior.

486
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,640
Well.

487
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,880
I am stubborn

488
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,840
and always disobey discipline.

489
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,320
So

490
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,000
I'd better not bother you.

491
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,230
I can go to another team.

492
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,280
Not at all.

493
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,550
Where there is trouble, there is a challenge.

494
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,960
I would appreciate your guidance.

495
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,910
Qian Wei.

496
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,280
When would the rain stop?

497
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,230
Let's go.

498
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,920
I will send you.

499
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,470
No need.

500
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,350
To be honest,

501
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,760
I could feel

502
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,680
you hate me

503
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,160
the first time I saw you.

504
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,950
If I offended you

505
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,310
somewhere,

506
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,040
just tell me.

507
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,070
I would apologize to you.

508
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,710
No.

509
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,190
Maybe I like being in the rain,

510
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,430
but you don't.

511
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,950
We are not the same.

512
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,160
We don't have to walk together.

513
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,280
Qian Wei.

514
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,040
Why are you following me?

515
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,560
You can leave

516
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,000
after the rain stops.

517
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,800
This is mine.

518
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,590
You took the wrong one.

519
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,800
It's okay, I am fine.

520
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,230
Well, you deserve to be single.

521
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,830
It's raining so hard.

522
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,280
It shouldn't be of any use.

523
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,310
Forget it, bye.

524
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,430
What a younger brother.

525
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,830
Qian Wei.

526
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,920
Your takeaway.

527
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,590
(Li Chongwen)
(Don't catch cold)

528
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,880
(Take care)

529
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,830
(I still remember)

530
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,230
(how embarrassed I was)

531
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,470
(when I first received your post-it note.)

532
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,310
Is the interview for debate over?

533
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,110
I just came back.

534
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,310
I know.

535
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
The debate is over.

536
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,350
And Professor Zhang has left.

537
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,830
Thank you.

538
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,000
Take the umbrella.

539
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,230
Qian Wei?

540
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,160
It's your takeaway.

541
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,560
(Li Chongwen)
(It doesn't matter that you missed the selection)

542
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,470
(If you like debate)

543
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,680
(I can teach you later)

544
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,160
(I'll reserve seat for you in the future games)

545
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,300
(Li Chongwen)

546
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,640
(Li Chongwen)
(Drink the ginger tea while it's hot)

547
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,710
(to prevent colds)

548
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,940
(Ambition all over the world,

550
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,680
(Later)

551
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,040
(Your post-it notes)

552
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,310
(accompanied me through countless moments)

553
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,680
(I thought at that time)

554
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,190
(that you were)

555
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,520
(the most thoughtful boy)

556
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,590
(You always captured)

557
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,920
(Chong&Wei Law Firm)
(my happiness and sadness sooner than me)

558
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,710
(Those post-it notes)

559
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,190
(smoothed out all the folds)

560
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,280
(in my heart)

561
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,400
(Li Chongwen)
(I was obsessed with)

562
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
(Ginger Green Tea Honey Ginger Tea)
(the world you created)

563

(with post-it notes)

564
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,400
(Eat breakfast while it's hot)
(I didn't find out)

565
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,830
(Take a rest when sleepy.)
(it was a cage)

566
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,390
(I can help you organize the information.)

567
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,880

Qian Wei.

579
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,470
The debate team just informed that

580
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,760
the debate competition is about to start.

581
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,280
Take a look at the topics inside.

582
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay.

583
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,160
Thanks.

584
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,820
(Don't catch a cold, take care. Li Chongwen)

585
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,470
Well.

586
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,310
I am back.

587
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,280
Okay.

588
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,590
Forget it.

589
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,950
It's okay, just go.

590
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,560
Our debate team is about to
enter the competition.

591
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,640
The subject this time

592
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,230
is labor dispute in the factory.

593
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,160
It stands to reason that

594
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,950
we have to use real cases as examples.

595
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,520
You're asking the right person.

596
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,760
There was a dispute in my factory
a few days ago.

597
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,190
I settled it myself.

598
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,430
Really?

599
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,470
Tell me about details.

600
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,800
Hold on.

601
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,470
Aren't you retired?

602
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,190
Well…

603
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:44,710
It's just…

604
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
I just stopped by.

605
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,160
Your dad isn't retired.

606
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,430
Some time ago, the factory manager

607
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,640
arbitrarily replaced the ink

608
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,470
with inferior products.

609
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,590
After he heard that,

610
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,520
he insisted on staying

611
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,280
to solve the problem.

612
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,400
How dare he?

613
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,590
Mom, stop him

614
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,280
right now.

615
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,520
I'll take care of the factory manager.

616
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,560
Understand?

617
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,380
I'll take care of the factory manager'

618
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,820
I'll take care of the factory manager'

619
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,400
Would you like to…?

620
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,950
No.

621
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,350
I am not even finished.

622
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,800
If there is an abnormality,
there must be something wrong.

623
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
There is nothing wrong.

624
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,310
I have a very good

625
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,800
case source ready.

626
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,640
Would you like

627
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,760
to experience

628
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
being a lawyer?

629
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,580
(Haizhou Guangming Parts Processing Factory)

630
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,280
This is where your dad works.

631
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,110
Act of Lawyer stipulates that

632
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,830
if you pretend to be a lawyer

633
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,560
to provide legal services,

634
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,800
the judicial administrative department

635
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,070
will confiscate the illegal income

636
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,110
and impose a fine of more than one time

637
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,310
and less than five times the illegal income.

638
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,230
Tell me the school motto.

639
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,190
Great virtue. Master law.

640
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,830
Stop.

641
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,640
See?

642
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,040
Why does great virtue come first?

643
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,040
First of all, we have to establish

644
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,800
a good sense of responsibility

645
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,430
and morality.

646
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,920
Then we serve it

647
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,710
with law.

648
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,230
Right?

649
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,040
I know you think

650
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,920
I'm doing this for my own good.

651
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,640
But actually no.

652
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,710
That's not where

653
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,040
my dad works alone, right?

654
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,350
There are also many

655
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,160
ordinary employees working there.

656
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Isn't the original purpose

657
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,590
of our study of law

658
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,040
to seek justice

659
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,190
and to speak out for justice?

660
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,400
All right.

661
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,950
I knew

662
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,230
you weren't so kind.

663
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,350
It's just a waste of time

664
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,430
preparing for you...

665
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,470
What?

666
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,590
You look so good in it.

667
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,680
You have a good taste.

668
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,920
This is new for the season.

669
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,560
It's only 2,500 yuan with discount.

670
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,680
Well.

671
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,400
Listen.

672
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,190
Actually he is my younger brother.

673
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:18,830
He had a girlfriend

674
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,110
who he was about to marry.

675
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,040
But she broke up with him.

676
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,400
Tomorrow is her wedding.

677
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,950
He just wants to wear a formal suit

678
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,070
to try again.

679
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,920
As his sister,

680
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,280
I really should support him.

681
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,400
But our family

682
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,640
is very poor.

683
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,760
I have only

684
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,560
less than a thousand Yuan.

685
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,110
Why did you get ill again?

686
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,950
My younger sister

687
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,310
was hurt by her boyfriend.

688
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,920
He cheated out of all her savings.

689
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,000
She's crazy

690
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,920
and has delusional disorder now.

691
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,280
You…

692
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,590
If you speak again,

693
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,400
I'll send you in.

694
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,640
Would you like to be sent away?

695
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,560
Would you like to?

696
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,280
No?

697
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,830
You know what?

698
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,350
She's very emotionally unstable right now.

699
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,470
Please understand.

700
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,070
She always imposes

701
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,710
her own story on me,

702
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,310
you know?

703
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,400
It's not my story.

704
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,070
It's his.

705
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,430
Would you like to be sent away?

706
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,760
I will make a phone call.

707
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,070
How did you promise me before?

708
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,230
You said you would behave yourself.

709
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,190
Are you going to keep making trouble?

710
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
It is such a blessing

711
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,230
to have such a brother.

712
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,830
Well.

713
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,640
Help yourselves.

714
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,000
I will offer you super VIP price.

715
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,950
70% off.

716
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,520
Thank you so much.

717
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,430
I am so grateful

718
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,640
that you could

719
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,470
understand

720
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,760
my strange younger sister.

721
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
Thank you so much.

722
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,430
All right, enough.

723
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,280
Or I will send you there.

724
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,400
Okay.

725
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,800
That means the suit

726
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,830
is only 937 Yuan.

727
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,470
We saved

728
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,710
1,563 Yuan.

729
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,760
So that we can

730
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,190
go to the restaurant eight times,

731
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,430
eat in the cafeteria one hundred times

732
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,920
or drink two hundred cups of milk tea, right?

733
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,190
Qian Wei.

734
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,590
You are so worthy of your name.

735
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,830
Brother.

736
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,430
Brother.

737
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,190
I'm sick, brother.

738
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,400
I know you are sick.

739
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
But stop making trouble out.

740
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,040
Could we…

741
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,190
Calm down?

742
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,040
What are you looking at?

743
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,040
What?

744
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,830
Mature beauty.

745
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,830
Good.

746
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,950
Thank you.

747
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,350
You're welcome, fool.

748
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,000
Wear the tie.

749
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,520
Wait.

750
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,680
Let me try.

751
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,710
Just to wear a tie.

752
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,000
You think

753
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,040
I can't even do this?

754
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,040
Well, I can't.

755
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,560
You do.

756
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,470
Why didn't listen to me?

757
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,830
I am giving you a chance.

758
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,680
Thank you.

759
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,470
Thank you.

760
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,640
What are you doing, Qian Wei?

761
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,920
I didn't mean to do it.

762
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,110
You are really a fool.

763
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,710
It seems that

764
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,710
I have you send you away later.

765
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,800
Stop looking at me.

766
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,950
Am I in good spirits?

767
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,920
But why are you

768
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,560
so skilled at

769
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
wearing a tie?

770
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,710
Because I wear it for you

771
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,680
every day in the future.

772
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,070
I like to practice.

773
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,160
I always practice it at home.

774
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,590
Why practice this?

775
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,680
What's wrong with you?

776
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,700
(Processing Factory)

777
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,980
(Bless)

778
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,300
(Processing Factory)

779
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,620
(Processing Factory)

780
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,940
(Check carefully for safety)

781
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,880
What are you doing?

782
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,110
Don't be afraid of them.

783
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,230
The more frightened you are,

784
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,590
the more arrogant he will be.

785
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,400
My endurance has been exercised by someone

786
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,680
to be very strong.

787
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,920
What are you two doing?

788
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,160
Who asked you to take pictures?

789
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,950
Hello, we are

790
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,920
(Qian Wei, Lawyer)
lawyers of Zhanying Law Firm.

791
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,640
My name is Qian Wei.

792
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,830
This is my assistant Lu.

793
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,470
We got a request

794
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,640
from a client

795
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,950
saying that the oil and paint

796
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,880
used here are not up to specification.

797
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,160
So we're came to obtain evidence.

798
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,830
Stop it. Just leave.

799
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,710
Leave.

800
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,950
What are you doing?

801
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,520
(Security)
If you hurt us,

802
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,350
it will be another story.

803
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,680
Listen.

804
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
If we leave now,

805
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,110
Quality Supervision Bureau will be here soon.

806
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,470
Quality Supervision Bureau?

807
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,680
Get them out.

808
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:04,950
Leave.

809
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,950
- You…
- Leave.

810
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,520
Wait.

811
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,040
What happened?

812
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,800
Manager.

813
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,280
She said the two of them are lawyers

814
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,470
and took a lot of photos.

815
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,560
Sorry.

816
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,400
(Realize ambition)
My men are rude.

817
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,190
I beg your understand.

818
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,070
Come on.

819
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,520
Take some tea.

820
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,520
Miss.

821
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,280
Who commissioned you?

822
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,800
It's not right to

823
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,950
condemn someone out of thin air.

824
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,640
We cannot disclose the information

825
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,470
of other parties

826
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,800
before putting on record.

827
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,880
But we can check the information

828
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,040
of the factory together.

829
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,350
(Civil Construction Engineering Indoor
Environmental Pollution Control)

830
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,920
Our country stipulates that

831
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,710
the content of benzene per cubic meter indoors

832
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,680
cannot exceed 0.09 mg.

833
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
The air quality in your factory

834
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,950
is seriously exceeded,

835
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,920
and the staff

836
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,430
are not equipped with

837
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,590
relevant protective measures.

838
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,110
You even force them to work overtime.

839
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,560
Sir.

840
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,520
Your violation

841
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,560
goes way too far.

842
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,620
(Civil Construction Engineering Indoor
Environmental Pollution Control)

843
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,220
(Student card)

844
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,000
Meanwhile,

845
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,800
we just asked

846
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,680
the nearby residents.

847
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,760
There is often the sound
of working overtime all night.

848
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,310
Your electricity bill this month

849
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,520
is also twice as high as that of last month.

850
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,040
This makes no sense.

851
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,560
The situation of our factory is special.

852
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,470
The working hours are all determined

853
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,470
by the production period of the product.

854
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,560
It's normal to work all night.

855
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,230
Really?

856
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
I suggest you

857
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,950
take a look at this.

858
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,280
According to the labor law,

859
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,040
employees cannot work

860
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,560
more than 36 hours of overtime

861
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,710
per month,

862
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,520
even if under special situation.

863
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
Your employees seem to

864
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,590
have worked overtime

865
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,920
for more than 40 hours.

866
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,400
Okay, let's put time aside.

867
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,590
According to law,

868
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,110
if employees work overtime,

869
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,280
you must pay them

870
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,000
no less than 150%

871
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,880
of their wages.

872
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,710
so did you pay them?

873
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,710
Both of you are

874
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,800
young and promising.

875
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,110
But why haven't I heard of

876
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,560
Zhanying Law Firm?

877
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,670
Gosh.

878
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,670
I forgot that Zhanying was only
established next year.

879
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,040
There are so many law firms in China.

880
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,600
Do you know every one of them?

881
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,470
Please come in.

882
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,760
Manager.

883
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,560
Someone from the court
came to send the materials.

884
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,000
Invite him in.

885
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,430
Okay.

886
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,710
If you two

887
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,040
are true lawyers,

888
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,120
you should have regular contact

889
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,040
with the court.

890
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,710
Let's talk together.

891
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,190
And I would

892
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,120
listen to the opinion of the court.

893
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,230
Of course.

894
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,000
No problem.

895
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,910
Okay.

896
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,360
Watch your words.

897
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,230
Zhang Bohan.

898
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,840
Yes.

899
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,950
Yang Lirong.

900
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,870
Yes.

901
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,710
Jiang Qing.

902
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,670
Yes.

903
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,360
Qian Wei.

904
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,760
Yes.

905
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,520
Zhang Dongchen.

906
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,670
Yes.

907
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,760
Lu Xun.

908
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,670
Yes.

909
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,390
Why looking at me?

910
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,000
Turn around.

911
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
It must be a girl.

912
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,120
Why doing this

913
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,080
on my class?

914
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,000
Who's that?

915
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,120
Turn around.

916
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,190
Stand up.

917
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,870
What?

918
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,560
You want to test my memory?

919
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,320
Okay.

920
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,190
Take turns reporting

921
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,150
from the first row.

922
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,040
If I find you,

923
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,360
your usual score

924
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,670
will be gone.

925
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,150
Start.

926
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,150
Ma Junqi.

927
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,320
Wu Fang.

928
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,190
Zhang Yanzhi.

929
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,910
Lu Die.

930
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,280
Yang Jiani.

931
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,560
Zhang Huilin.

932
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,800
Yang Lirong.

933
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,670
Wang Qianqian.

934
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,670
Jiang Qing.

935
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,670
Zhang Dongchen.

936
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:51,910
Wu Zu.

937
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,430
Wang Yinuo.

938
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,120
Personal loyalty

939
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,470
is top priority.

940
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,950
Let's get it.

941
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,150
Professor, I…

942
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,670
What's wrong with you?

943
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,430
What's wrong with you?

944
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,150
Take her to the clinic.

945
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,870
Hurry up.

946
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,080
Do me a favor.

947
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,670
Let's go.

948
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,710
Come here.

949
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,950
Open the door.

950
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,900
(Realize ambition)

951
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,470
Mr. Liu.

952
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,230
Hello.

953
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,190
Perfect timing.

954
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,360
Today,

955
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,870
two young people

956
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,120
who claim to be lawyers

957
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,360
from Zhanying Law Firm came to me.

958
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,600
I don't think

959
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
I've ever heard of it.

960
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,230
You know

961
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,950
many lawyers.

962
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,150
Do you know them?

963
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,670
Uncle Liu.

964
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,670
Lu Xun.

965
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,520
Long time no see.

966
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,950
Chief Judge Lu

967
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,870
always talks about you.

968
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,470
I didn't expect to

969
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,320
meet you here today.

970
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,760
What are you doing here?

971
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,080
Good question.

972
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,560
What am I doing here?

973
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,470
They came to popularize law education

974
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,390
for the staff of our factory.

975
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,670
Legal education.

976
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,670
That's right.

977
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,390
You should be

978
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,710
well educated.

979
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,710
Regard law with awe.

980
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,190
Yes.

981
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,360
Of course.

982
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,910
Of course.

983
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,600
Good for you, Lu.

984
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
Like father like son.

985
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,150
I believe

986
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,320
you would become a judge in the future.

987
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,080
Good boy.

988
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,280
Chief Judge Lu

989
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,430
could retire with peace of mind

990
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,040
in a few years.

991
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,840
Right.

992
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,360
Fulfill obligations well in the future.

993
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,430
This time the court lifted

994
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,670
the high consumption restraining order
against you.

995
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,080
This is the notice.

996
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,430
Pay attention to the repayment period
in the future

997
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,800
and avoid repeat offenses.

998
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,520
Of course I will.

999
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,280
Of course.

1000
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,950
Of course.

1001
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,390
I am leaving.

1002
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,390
Lu.

1003
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,230
Bye.

1004
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,710
Let me see you off.

1005
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,080
Take a seat.

1006
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,430
It's good to have a judge dad.

1007
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,910
I will be a judge

1008
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,950
in the future.

1009
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,230
It's not too late for you

1010
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,520
to recognize me

1011
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,430
as your chief.

1012
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,760
Why don't you

1013
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
let me call you boss?

1014
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,230
I predict that

1015
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,430
you will not be a judge in the future.

1016
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Cool.

1017
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,230
I believe that.

1018
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,670
After Lu Xun's father

1019
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,600
retired,

1020
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,560
he became a lawyer

1021
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,670
without hesitation.

1022
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,080
Lu Xun

1023
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,840
still doesn't know much

1024
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
about himself.

1025
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,710
Chief Judge Lu's son

1026
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,360
is really handsome.

1027
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,000
Let's have dinner together today.

1028
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,430
Just to know each other.

1029
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,710
There is no need to eat together.

1030
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,080
But we have to

1031
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,190
figure out something.

1032
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,800
Was your repayment

1033
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,710
embezzled from

1034
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,950
oil and paint fees?

1035
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,670
You allow workers

1036
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,360
to continue to work

1037
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,760
with excessive benzene,

1038
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,870
which seriously affects

1039
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,870
their health.

1040
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,360
They are doing

1041
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,560
high-risk jobs.

1042
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,950
Therefore, according to labor law,

1043
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,150
you must match them with

1044
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,080
corresponding insurance

1045
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,430
and protective measures.

1046
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,120
Since you didn't do it,

1047
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,950
you definitely have to

1048
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,430
compensate them.

1049
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,760
But

1050
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,230
none of the surrounding factories did this.

1051
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,800
You are forcing me to lose money.

1052
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,800
The surrounding factories

1053
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,280
didn't owe money,

1054
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,190
didn't use

1055
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,150
inferior paint,

1056
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,430
neither did they violate labor law

1057
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,470
and squeeze employees.

1058
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:57,950
Think about it.

1059
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,950
If you are

1060
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,280
accused in court,

1061
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,430
and other companies

1062
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,950
see all the evidence

1063
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,120
and your company's scandal,

1064
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,000
will they still

1065
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,040
cooperate with you?

1066
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,280
Well.

1067
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,120
You can refuse to

1068
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,950
pay compensation now,

1069
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,280
but you won't be able
to make money in the future.

1070
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,360
Sir.

1071
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,230
We don't mean to make it hard for you.

1072
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,430
We also brought

1073
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,630
a settlement agreement this time.

1074
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,710
In fact, our request is quite simple.

1075
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,470
(Collectively Negotiated Settlement Agreement)
As long as you replace the oil and paint

1076
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,670
within the specified time,

1077
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,870
equip all the staff

1078
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,760
with corresponding protective measures,

1079
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,950
buy them insurance

1080
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,390
and pay compensation,

1081
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,000
we will not sue.

1082
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,630
Would you like to think about it?

1083
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Boss.

1084
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,320
I don't think

1085
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,360
he intends to reconcile.

1086
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,870
I suggest we sue directly.

1087
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,710
Sue?

1088
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,190
It will have…

1089
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,390
Let me think it over.

1090
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,320
Let me think it over.

1091
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,150
Let me think it over.

1092
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,800
Okay?

1093
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,120
Let me take a look.

1094
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,870
Take a look.

1095
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,560
Ten minutes?

1096
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,870
Five minutes?

1097
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,390
Go ahead.

1098
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,670
Signs are all normal.

1099
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,910
She should be fine.

1100
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,670
But she has to be careful.

1101
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,670
Okay, thank you, doctor.

1102
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,760
Go back to class first.

1103
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,190
Okay.

1104
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,800
Besides pretending to faint,
I still have to jump out of the window.

1105
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,280
I sacrificed too much.

1106
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,470
You woke up.

1107
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,040
What are you doing?

1108
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,710
I felt chest distress,

1109
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
so I'd like to open the window
for some fresh air.

1110
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,870
You just woke up.

1111
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,840
You'd better not do this.

1112
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,230
Come on.

1113
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,150
Let me help you.

1114
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,230
Be careful.

1115
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,430
Be careful.

1116
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,910
Take a seat.

1117
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,040
The coat of you

1118
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,630
is quite different from your personality.

1119
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,710
It's full of rivets.

1120
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,630
Luckily it didn't hurt you

1121
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,560
when you fainted just now.

1122
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,230
I got up late this morning.

1123
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,800
This is

1124
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,670
my roommate's coat.

1125
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm not usually like this.

1126
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,000
Relax.

1127
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,870
Thank you, doc.

1128
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,000
I am Liu Shiyun of
