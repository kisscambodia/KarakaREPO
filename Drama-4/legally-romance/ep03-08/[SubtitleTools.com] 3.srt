(Turn the tide to take Lu Xun's life.)

4
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,680
(Lu Xun joined the debate team first)

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,040
(and became Professor Zhang's
favorite student.)

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,790
(He became a trainee)

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,430
(in a superb law firm
before the graduation)

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,000
(thanks to Professor Zhang's
recommendation.)

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,880
(Certificate, Lu Xun)
(Become the best debater.)

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,950
(Then Lu Xun became)

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,400
(the best debater of the college.)

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,000
(He was also elected)

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,150
(President of the Student Union.)

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,630
(He took firm steps forward)

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,240
(and accumulated many resources.)

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
(I'll copy Lu Xun's)

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,950
(perfect life)

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,680
(to push him into a dead end.)

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,950
(I can't wait to see)

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,680
(a boss become an assistant.)

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,540

25

=Legally Romance=

30
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,110
It's so quiet today.

31
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,360
Zixin.

32
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,520
That's your family photo?

33
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,110
Let me see it.

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,720
Yes.

35
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,270
You were under 10 then?

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
You've been wearing

37
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,910
that crystal necklace since then?

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,670
It's nothing fancy.

39
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,630
You've been wearing it so long.

40
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,360
Lu Xun gave me it.

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,720
We were classmates then

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,030
and he lived quite near.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,360
Lu Xun gave you that?

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,800
Then he must be Lu Xun.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,550
Yes.

46
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,190
Then you were not just

47
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,390
playmates in childhood,

48
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,160
you're also classmates

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,270
in the college.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Is this a trendy drama

51
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,470
of you two?

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Awesome.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
About the reason

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,160
we entered the same college,

55
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,440
he asked me

56
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,270
about the college I applied for.

57
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,390
He even asked you?

58
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,360
Then Lu Xun planned for this.

59
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,390
Then it's kind of

60
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,720
first come first served.

61
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,160
Do you like him…

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,880
All right, enough.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,030
Will you hang the laundry?

64
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,160
Let me wash them for you.

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,630
You're shy, Zixin?

66
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,440
Stop it.

67
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,880
You're not frank.

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
There's a hole on his heart.

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,670
He studies the laws for love.

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,750
I'm impressed, Lu Xun.

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,910
A wild guy inside.

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,880
I was too occupied with love

73
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,670
and got my business ruined.

74
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,360
If I encourage Lu Xun

75
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,230
to be with Zixin

76
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,920
and let him indulge in love,

77
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,790
the first place

78
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,790
will be mine.

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,390
(Auxiliary quest.)

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,350
(Match Lu Xun with Zixin.)

81
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,000
(So the little brother
will indulge in love)

82
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,720
(and ignore his business.)

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,440
(The big sister
will brave winds and waves)

84
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,880
(to take the lead.)

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
Where's my underwear?

86
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,320
Is there really an underwear thief?

87
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,160
Nice shot.

88
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,000
Help.

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,880
- He's the lecher who steals underwear.
- Let go.

90
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,390
Help.

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,390
Stop it.

92
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,550
Hurry.

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,640
Stop struggling.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,200
How's he?

95
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,830
Move.

96
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,670
Take him away.

97
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,200
Move.

98
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,040
You alright?

99
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,200
Did you catch the thief?

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,320
Did you catch him?

101
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,510
- I did.
- You did?

102
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,230
Where's he?

103
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,830
They took him away?

104
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,600
Your blood.

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,440
(Qian Chuan's thigh)

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,320
(was wounded when he tried)
(Prevent brother from being wounded.)

107
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,270
(to catch the underwear thief.)

108
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,790
(He could no longer be an athlete,)

109
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,040
(let alone joining the national team.)

110
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,670
(After graduation,)

111
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,480
(he could only be a fitness coach,)

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,830
(boasting every day
about the past glory.)

113
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,760
(So he was elected)

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
(the most annoying coach)

115
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,950
(alone.)

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,040
(Qian Chuan had a crush on Zixin)

117
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,350
(because of that.)

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,270
(Prevent Qian Chuan from loving Mo Zixin.)
(Though I helped him a lot,)

119
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,550
(it didn't take long)

120
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,440
(before they broke up.)

121
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,440
(Qian Chuan has been suffering
from love since then.)

122
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,760
(And Lu Xun,
who studied the laws for love,)

123
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,760
(tortured me crazy)

124
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,110
(for having robbed him of his love)

125
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,790
(as a boss.)

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,070
Being disappointed in love
or being hurt,

127
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,920
whether it's for Qian Chuan

128
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,350
or for myself,

129
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,790
I have to

130
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,200
find its source and cut off

131
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,110
the ill-fated relation.

132
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,510
I remember clearly

133
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,070
that I locked the door of the balcony.

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,230
How could it be stolen?

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,950
In that case,

136
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,390
we can no longer

137
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,040
hang the laundry on the balcony.

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,550
It's fine.

139
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,600
Leave that matter to me,

140
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
the prophet, to handle.

141
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,480
I just need your cooperation.

142
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,640
We will.

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,720
Shall I take a shovel

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,760
or a screwdriver?

145
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,600
I've learned eight years…

146
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
Those are not necessary.

147
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,670
It'll be too bloody.

148
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,110
Just protect yourself.

149
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,950
Liu.

150
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,670
Your duty is

151
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,070
keep Zixin safe.

152
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,230
Just go to

153
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,640
the supermarket

154
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,390
to buy some food you want.

155
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,390
Don't come back

156
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,390
until it closes.

157
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,790
Just remember one thing,

158
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,790
never go to the sports ground.

159
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,270
Got it?

160
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
OK. So be it.

161
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,320
Come on.

162
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,070
- You're exaggerating.
- Get yourself changed.

163
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,830
Let's go to the supermarket.

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,950
Here's a lecher.

165
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,270
Here's a lecher.

166
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,920
Here's a lecher.

167
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,350
Here's a lecher.

168
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,950
What the hell?

169
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,000
Stop chasing me.

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,720
Here's a lecher.

171
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,230
Stop chasing me.

172
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,830
Here's a lecher.

173
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,550
Here's a lecher.

174
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,160
Here…

175
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,480
Here. We caught him red-handed.

176
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,550
Which department do you belong to?

177
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,510
Go to the Security Office with us.

178
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,670
No. Aunt, look.

179
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,200
He's not the lecher.

180
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,350
I just saw the lecher

181
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,880
wearing a mask

182
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
and different pants.

183
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,440
It wasn't him?

184
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,270
He's wearing a hat

185
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,880
and carrying a bag.

186
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,920
He's a tall guy.

187
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,670
Hold on.

188
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,390
Look, aunt,

189
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,230
it really wasn't him.

190
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,790
I saw that lecher

191
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,270
gave him the bag.

192
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,350
Plus we were taking a walk together

193
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,200
and we were going to have dinner.

194
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,720
Really?

195
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,440
Who'd walk and eat with you?

196
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,070
Aunt.

197
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,760
I don't know her so well.

198
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,030
You're a student

199
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,110
of the law school,

200
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,790
how could you commit perjury?

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,350
I don't need

202
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,200
your protection.

203
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,840
What's more,

204
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,640
who'd believe

205
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
you were taking a walk

206
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,280
with a broom

207
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,030
at night?

208
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,150
Friend.

209
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,710
it's not time to pretend to be just.

210
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,150
So you admit

211
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,640
you stole the underwear?

212
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,470
I didn't do it.

213
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,760
Do I look like the man who did it?

214
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,400
Huh?

215
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,670
Then where's the thief

216
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,670
who stole it?

217
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
I know it.

218
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,880
You're frying the chicken

219
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,150
right after you stole the underwear.

220
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,280
did you wash your hands?

221
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,520
What're you talking about?

222
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
I've been staying here.

223
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,200
I didn't go anywhere.

224
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,440
Fine.

225
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,790
Let me remind you.

226
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,030
If you keep covering your arm

227
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,670
with the clothes.

228
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,230
it's going to

229
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,440
get inflamed.

230
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,710
It's fine you don't confess,

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
the police will

232
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
compare the skin tissue

233
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
with yours when they come.

234
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,840
Besides,

235
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,590
do I have to

236
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,520
tell you

237
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,110
what you're hiding

238
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,110
in your bed?

239
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,910
Look out!

240
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
- Get him.
- Don't move.

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,200
Cuff him.

242
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,350
Who the hell are you?

243
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,710
How did you know it clearly?

244
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,710
Of course I know it.

245
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,670
It was I

246
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,550
who was interviewed

247
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,640
with Qian Chuan 11 years ago.

248
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,670
I know exactly

249
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,230
how he stole it

250
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,590
and how he escaped.

251
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,710
The guy who jeopardized
Qian Chuan's dream of

252
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,520
joining the national tea.

253
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,200
I will never

254
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,080
forget him.

255
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm a prophet.

256
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,350
Take him away

257
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,590
and send him to the police station.

258
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,590
Well done, Qian Wei.

259
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,520
You're amazing.

260
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,960
You're so talkative for a thief.

261
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,790
Let's take photos.

262
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
It's not a big deal.

263
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,910
Look this way.

264
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,000
- Not a big deal.
- Look this way.

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,030
There's no streaming now,

266
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,590
or I'll be rich.

267
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,110
Your hand.

268
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,440
My wonderful life

269
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,910
ends before it starts.

270
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,550
Forget it.

271
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,880
Since Qian Chuan

272
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,030
didn't meet Zixin,

273
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,440
I should've changed the past already.

274
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,150
Let me take you to the infirmary.

275
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,710
What're you looking at?

276
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,150
Your eyeballs almost fall out.

277
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,640
A fairy.

278
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,030
You know who she is?

279
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,880
How could a mortal

280
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,960
like me know it

281
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,520
since she's a fairy?

282
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,150
Anyway,

283
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,550
I'm sure she's not from our school.

284
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,520
Stop looking,

285
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,400
we have stuff to buy.

286
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,960
Come on.

287
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,960
Why can't I do it?

288
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,880
I have something

289
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,790
to tell you now.

290
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,640
If I don't tell you,

291
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,550
there won't be a second chance.

292
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,230
You have to remember

293
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,910
that I got hurt because of you.

294
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,080
If I'm lucky enough

295
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,350
to survive this…

296
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,790
You'll marry me?

297
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,150
No.

298
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,440
I don't crave your beauty.

299
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,760
My point is

300
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,590
don't you become

301
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,150
the obstacle of my life.

302
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,230
If you want to open

303
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,080
a law firm with me,

304
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,880
fine.

305
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,520
But you have to promise

306
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,960
that you'll give me all the good cases.

307
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,880
What the heck

308
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,670
is on your mind?

309
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,350
Do you have something

310
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,640
to tell me or not?

311
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,230
I do.

312
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,080
We must

313
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,230
treat each other harmoniously.

314
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,790
Even if I have a better life than yours,

315
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,110
you can't be mad

316
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,640
and retaliate me.

317
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,520
And?

318
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,200
And…

319
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,400
I know you never played truant,

320
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,710
could you answer it for me

321
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,640
when they call the roll?

322
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
And?

323
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,910
And…

324
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,880
Why did you agree

325
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,150
with it so frankly?

326
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,030
No.

327
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,840
It's not the way to the infirmary?

328
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,200
Hey.

329
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,080
You can't…

330
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,880
You can't feel bothered

331
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,230
because you think

332
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,080
I named

333
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,790
too many terms

334
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,030
and you want to kill me.

335
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,110
Look, I really got hurt

336
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,350
because of you.

337
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,080
You have to take the responsibility.

338
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,000
You speak loudly

339
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,910
and think clearly,

340
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,110
so you won't die

341
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,400
and needn't go to the infirmary.

342
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,790
No.

343
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,200
I'll be amputated.

344
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,550
Is that so?

345
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,080
Your hand

346
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,790
stopped bleeding just now.

347
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,320
It stopped just now.

348
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
It stopped bleeding

349
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,400
when you told me

350
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,200
not to retaliate.

351
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,840
So could you

352
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,230
get off?

353
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,000
How did I know it?

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
I was afraid it'd get inflamed,

355
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,550
then the inflammation

356
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,840
would give me tetanus.

357
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,350
And…

358
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,790
Could you stop

359
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,320
talking nonsense,

360
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,030
all right?

361
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,840
Why you are

362
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
even wordier than

363
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,880
my parents?

364
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,760
We'd better

365
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,590
keep a distance.

366
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,320
We shall be

367
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,910
normal friends.

368
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,400
OK?

369
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,910
What's more,

370
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,670
you're so heavy.

371
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,520
Time to reduce weight.

372
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,110
Stop staring me

373
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,710
and go to my dorm.

374
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,960
Why should I go there?

375
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,320
I'm a person of principle.

376
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,150
Listen up,

377
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,760
though I'm wounded,

378
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,910
I still have principles.

379
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,350
Stop talking.

380
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,960
I also have…

381
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,760
My hand!

382
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,110
Listen up,

383
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,710
the place you touch

384
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,790
is linked

385
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,150
to here.

386
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,960
They'll all be hurt.

387
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,590
All right?

388
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,200
Say no more.

389
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,350
Do as I say, OK?

390
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,440
You were lucky
he didn't hurt your artery.

391
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,000
I suggest you keep here

392
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,150
from water for a week.

393
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,110
Thank you.

394
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,880
I should thank you.

395
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,760
But

396
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,520
could you

397
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,760
not be so rash the next time?

398
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,880
Aren't you a prophet?

399
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,520
Couldn't you foretell

400
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,150
you'd be hurt?

401
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,440
I didn't,

402
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,000
because you were the biggest bug

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,910
in my plan.

404
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,110
Here.

405
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Take it to apply yourself.

406
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,230
You use such cute band-aids?

407
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,320
Well,

408
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,110
you're a man wild inside.

409
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,470
Now I know you

410
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,710
a bit more.

411
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,670
Look,

412
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,910
when I was a kid,

413
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,880
my mom liked it

414
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,030
and used to apply it for me.

415
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,080
So I've been…

416
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,440
Right.

417
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,880
You want them or not?

418
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,710
Thank your mom.

419
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,320
Give them to me.

420
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,910
Qian Wei.

421
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,590
I've been looking for you.

422
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,320
Aunt Ma went to be interviewed

423
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
by the policemen.

424
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,080
She told me to give you this.

425
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,590
OK. Thanks.

426
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,030
What's in it?

427
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,150
Look,

428
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,840
you caught that psycho,

429
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,200
so you should give it to Zixin.

430
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,960
(How could it be mine?)

431
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,840
I shall go.

432
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,710
Good night.

433
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,200
Hey.

434
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,230
Watch your hand.

435
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
(Acted bravely)

436
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,700
(A commendation for the brave Wei)

437
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,260
(Announcement)

(The results of College-opening Exam
for Law Department 2011)

439
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,060
(Rank: 1. Qian Wei. 2. Lu Xun.)

440
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,260

(The election of the monitor)
(Ballot Box)

444
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:04,800
Look.

445
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,680
Lu Xun.

446
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,470
As I divined,

447
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,000
you're meant to be defeated by me.

448
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,880
How about this?

449
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,430
Admit your defeat

450
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,310
and

451
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,520
beg me,

452
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,680
then I'll figure out a way

453
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
to solve that problem.

454
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,830
Stop talking nonsense.

455
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,430
All right?

456
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,310
Don't you know

457
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,310
what dirty tricks you played

458
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,310
to carry out a canvass?

459
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,070
What dirty tricks?

460
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,430
You deserved it if you won

461
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,280
and I played tricks because I won?

462
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,400
You're so arrogant.

463
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,190
Qian Wei is

464
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,310
the only true prophet here.

465
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,190
Of course we'd elect her

466
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,310
the monitor.

467
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,110
Qian Wei, it's for you.

468
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,310
I'm good.

469
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,110
Look at the flowers.

470
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Qian Wei, here are snacks.

471
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,590
And snacks?

472
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,040
Anyway,

473
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,430
Lu Xun is a deputy monitor

474
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,920
who can do the real things.

475
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,590
Monitor,

476
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,350
check it out.

477
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,920
You've gone viral on Renren.

478
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,190
People are all talking about you.

479
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,350
saying you're not just a prophet,

480
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,190
but a hero who fought

481
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,430
a thief with a knife.

482
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,000
The students of the other schools

483
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
are all asking about you.

484
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,000
It's not a big deal.

485
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,520
Monitor,

486
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,560
could you divine for me

487
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,680
and give me some luck?

488
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,160
Monitor,

489
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,160
for the sake of

490
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,430
my vote for you,

491
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,800
divine for me, too.

492
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,520
Could I buy the ticket

493
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,880
for the concert this year?

494
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,350
And

495
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,350
am I meant to

496
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,430
be with him?

497
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,430
Let's keep a low profile.

498
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:32,950
In fact,

499
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,590
those are not

500
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,830
my only merits.

501
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,430
Right?

502
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,950
They're just

503
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,470
a small part of them.

504
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,880
What else do I have?

505
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,640
Such as,

506
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,710
I'm resourceful

507
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,760
and gorgeous.

508
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,590
And…

509
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,280
Haven't you checked your mind yet?

510
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,680
Wake up.

511
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,070
Don't live in the dreams.

512
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,310
What's wrong with dream

513
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,280
as long as I can win?

514
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,760
Let me see it.

515
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,190
You're so mean.

516
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,950
Collection Poems of Tomas Transtrome.

517
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,430
You have a good taste.

518
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,350
Listen to me,

519
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,470
he'll win Nobel Prize in Literature

520
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,680
the next month.

521
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,420
(The Painted Veil)

522
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,680
Look,

523
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,310
it's pointless to like him.

524
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,110
The Maugham you like

525
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,190
never won

526
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,000
Nobel Prize.

527
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
He sucked.

528
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,310
I used my bottle

529
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,920
to occupy a seat for you.

530
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,230
Go to study now.

531
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,640
These books…

532
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,470
Are you done?

533
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,760
You're so mean.

534
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,000
Lu Xun.

535
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You want to know

536
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,800
your luck in your relationship?

537
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,350
I can divine

538
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,230
for you for free.

539
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,000
Like I said,

540
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,160
I want no relationship.

541
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,920
You think I don't know it?

542
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,430
The reason you came here

543
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,070
was because of Zixin.

544
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,880
You applied for this college

545
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,800
because you knew

546
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,950
she did it.

547
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,430
I know your tricks.

548
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,760
My teacher let me

549
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,560
asked about the applications

550
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,950
of the students of the other schools

551
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,400
for the sake of reliability.

552
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,280
So proud.

553
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,160
You still refuse to admit it.

554
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,040
Just because you want
no relationship now

555
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,880
doesn't mean you don't want one

556
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,950
in the future.

557
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,560
Look, if you don't chase

558
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,040
the girl you like,

559
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,400
you'll stand no chance.

560
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,040
I

561
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,430
don't trust you.

562
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,470
Be my guest.

563
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,400
You'll be single

564
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,230
11 years later,

565
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,710
then you'll come to

566
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,800
beg me in tears.

567
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,070
We'll still be together

568
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,310
in 11 years?

569
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,520
Qian Wei.

570
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,710
You really think

571
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,680
you protected me from a knife

572
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,640
and I'll have

573
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,070
a crush on you?

574
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,560
Don't you think so!

575
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,070
You think I like you?

576
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,640
Or what?

577
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
You occupied the seat for me,

578
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,000
you searched my application,

579
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
you tried to tease me out

580
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,310
and managed to know I liked Maugham.

581
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,430
Look at you,

582
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,680
isn't it obvious

583
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,830
that you're so cunning?

584
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,400
Huh?

585
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,000
See?

586
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,880
Zixin told me

587
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,800
to occupy

588
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,230
the seats for you two.

589
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,950
Touch your face,

590
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,430
see if the slap hurts.

591
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,470
I like you?

592
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,190
You're like a hedgehog.

593
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,280
Qian Wei.

594
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,830
What did you say?

595
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,190
What hedgehog?

596
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,160
Even if I am,

597
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm a pretty hedgehog.

598
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,430
Lu Xun.

599
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,070
I told you

600
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,430
it was an effective cleanser.

601
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,430
I'll give you one later.

602
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,950
All right.

603
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,880
Could he

604
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,110
be the underwear thief

605
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,280
who came here

606
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,190
for retaliation?

607
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,430
Zixin.

608
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,470
Go to tell aunt Ma.

609
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,520
I'll keep watching here.

610
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,040
Be careful.

611
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,070
You psycho.

612
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,040
How dare you steal the underwear?

613
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,710
What're you doing?

614
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,640
Did you steal my underwear?

615
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,000
No.

616
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,680
No?

617
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,800
- I'm here to install the latch.
- How dare you do it?

618
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,280
Aunt Ma.

619
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,830
Aunt Ma.

620
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,400
Hey.

621
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,230
The underwear thief

622
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,350
came to our dorm again.

623
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,710
He did?

624
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,160
Is here a scenic spot?

625
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,310
Let's go check it out.

626
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,760
This way.

627
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,830
Don't think I won't beat women.

628
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,110
I learned jujitsu for 8 years.

629
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,310
You're no match for me.

630
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,680
Guards?

631
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,950
The underwear thief came here again.

632
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,310
This way.

633
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,070
The students caught him.

634
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,160
They're fighting.

635
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,430
Come and help us.

636
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,310
Hurry.

637
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,190
Step aside.

638
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,920
Are you alright?

639
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,470
Qian Chuan?

640
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,280
Sis.

641
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,310
Why are you here?

642
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,350
Why it's you?

643
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,560
You know each other?

644
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,160
He's my brother.

645
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,470
A freshman
of the College of Physical Education.

646
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,070
What're you looking at?

647
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,070
Back to your rooms.

648
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,800
Come on.

649
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,310
What's wrong with you?

650
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,830
I told you

651
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,640
I came to install the latch.

652
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
You buy it now?

653
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,230
You law students

654
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,110
are so suspicious.

655
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,520
I have my reason.

656
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,830
You look so strong,

657
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,000
I can tell you're a P.E. student.

658
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
You're stronger.

659
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,760
None of my school

660
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,590
is tougher than you.

661
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,350
Sis.

662
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,110
Look at my wounds

663
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,350
she did it.

664
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,680
All right, save your words.

665
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:16,800
Look,

666
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,190
aunt Ma, it's a misunderstanding.

667
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,800
I'm sorry.

668
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,350
Why don't you go back?

669
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,040
A man tried to

670
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,000
break into a female dorm,

671
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,230
was that a misunderstanding?

672
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,400
He broke the rules.

673
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,190
I didn't break into it.

674
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,640
It wasn't locked

675
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,230
when I came.

676
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,070
Right.

677
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,920
It was me.

678
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,830
I left in such a hurry

679
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,430
that I

680
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,280
forgot to lock it.

681
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,230
It won't happen again.

682
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,830
Be careful.

683
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,160
Look at yourselves.

684
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,710
You broke in,

685
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,590
you fought

686
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,880
and you didn't lock the door.

687
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,280
Only you are innocent.

688
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,950
I'll send you

689
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,310
to your adviser to handle.

690
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:46,830
No.

691
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,640
Aunt Ma.

692
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,710
It's not a big deal.

693
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,520
Plus we're freshmen

694
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,230
who don't know the rules so well.

695
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,830
Since we didn't mistake before,

696
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,160
please forgive us.

697
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,310
We're disciplined people,

698
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,040
really.

699
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,920
Yes.

700
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,710
Really?

701
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,470
Step aside.

702
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,110
What's this?

703
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,160
It's confiscated.

704
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:17,640
It's exactly the same

705
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,710
with what's written

706
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,800
in the script of my fate.

707
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,830
My condolences.

708
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,160
You broke into the female dorm,

709
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,310
you beat him

710
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,350
and hid electrical equipment
against the rules.

711
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,800
How many troubles did you make

712
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
in such a short time?

713
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,350
To think you're the monitor

714
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,160
who acted bravely

715
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,280
to help people.

716
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Now you showed your true color

717
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
so quickly?

718
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,680
Sir, they're just surprises.

719
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,760
It's true.

720
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,470
You've broken so many rules

721
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,640
and should be punished,

722
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,520
I'm so surprised.

723
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,190
Why do I have

724
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,070
such students like you?

725
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,190
Sir, we just came here,

726
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,470
so we need time to

727
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,760
adapt to this place.

728
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,950
Mr. Zhen,

729
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,950
you're the best.

730
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,920
We'll never do it again.

731
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
Come on, Mr. Zhen.

732
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,470
Stop, save your trick.

733
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:10,830
Mr. Zhen.

734
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,040
Stop it.

735
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,880
Stop.

736
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,430
Stand there.

737
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,280
You're way too strong.

738
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,710
You young people

739
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,350
have no sense of respect

740
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,040
You three,

741
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,920
go to frog leap for five rounds

742
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,310
with a chair on your heads.

743
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,590
I have to teach you a lesson

744
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,710
for your grave mistakes.

745
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,520
As for the disciplinary action,

746
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,190
I won't take it for the moment.

747
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,710
Thank you, sir.

748
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,000
Thank you, sir.

749
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,640
I have business to do.

750
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,560
I'll send a student

751
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,640
to count for you

752
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
and watch you.

753
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't be lazy.

754
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,520
We won't.

755
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,950
I've been Zhen's student

756
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,880
so many years,

757
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,590
how couldn't I know

758
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,880
he's a kind man with a sharp tongue?

759
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,070
He'll send someone

760
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,950
to supervise us?

761
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,310
We just take it

762
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,470
as an exercise after dinner.

763
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,040
Qian Wei, hold the chair higher.

764
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,710
Don't be lazy.

765
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,110
How long do you

766
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,110
want to keep jumping?

767
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,880
Why did Zhen send this guy?

768
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,070
How many eyes does he have?

769
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,520
Why he can see everything?

770
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
A curve wrecker is really different.

771
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,190
Zhen is so cruel

772
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,160
to send him.

773
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,000
It was your fault.

774
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,280
If you didn't beat me,

775
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
how could we be punished?

776
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,230
It's called risk sharing.

777
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,070
All right?

778
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,190
You would've been

779
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,800
sent to the dean's office
were it not for us.

780
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,280
Why you're

781
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,350
such an ungrateful lad?

782
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,430
Bah.

783
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,520
You're calling white black.

784
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,430
Bah.

785
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,520
Enough.

786
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,430
Aren't you

787
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,950
tired enough?

788
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
Are you tired?

789
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,920
I have some beverages for you.

790
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,430
I dare not to drink.

791
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,560
Lu Xun.

792
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,230
There is time for rest

793
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,110
even in a sports meeting.

794
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,830
Why not

795
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,640
let them take a break

796
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,400
and have some beverages

797
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,710
for refreshing.

798
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,160
All right.

799
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,110
You'll have

800
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,070
5 minutes.

801
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,760
Qian Wei. Shiyun.

802
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,000
I didn't ask you

803
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,880
about your school,

804
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,710
to think you're my sis's roommate.

805
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,880
Let me introduce myself.

806
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,950
I'm Qian Chuan.

807
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,800
A freshman of the Department of P. E.

808
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,830
Who wants to know your name?

809
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
How did you know each other?

810
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,350
We met in a store.

811
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm Mo Zixin.

812
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,800
Call me Zixin

813
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,880
like them.

814
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,590
OK.

815
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,710
He doesn't have to call you that.

816
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,110
The best-laid schemes
of mice and men oft go astray.

817
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,400
It still happened.

818
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,710
Shiyun, it's yours.

819
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,110
Lu Xun.

820
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,760
Let me join him.

821
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,000
So each of us

822
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,070
will jump less.

823
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,520
All right.

824
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,400
Each of them should jump five rounds.

825
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,680
They just jumped two rounds each.

826
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,070
There are nine rounds in total.

827
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,430
If you join them,

828
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,710
each of you has to

829
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,190
jump 2.25 rounds.

830
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,040
Just reduce them to two rounds.

831
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,920
It's hard to

832
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
count the rest 0.25 round.

833
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,110
Why it's hard to count?

834
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,920
0.25 round.

835
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,280
I just drew it.

836
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,920
See?

837
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,800
It'll be 0.25 round

838
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,470
when you get there.

839
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,070
Get it?

840
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,280
Forget it, Zixin.

841
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,280
You didn't do anything wrong.

842
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,640
No need to be punished with us.

843
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,470
It's fine.

844
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,640
You'll join them?

845
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:00,830
Yes.

846
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,920
We share the same room

847
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,680
so we shall woe, too.

848
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,070
I'm aged.

849
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,520
Really.

850
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,160
You alright?

851
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,640
Yeah.

852
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,190
Don't cheat.

853
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,350
You still have a round.

854
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,830
It's the last round.

855
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,430
Let Zixin rest.

856
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,160
If she quit,

857
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,880
you'll have

858
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,950
0.75 round to go.

859
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,350
(He's watching the beauties
being punished)

860
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,470
(without doing anything)

861
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,950
(He deserves to be single.)

862
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,560
I'm fine.

863
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,190
I can make it

864
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,230
She's so tired,

865
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,430
couldn't you make an exception?

866
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,920
Don't beg him.

867
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,520
He looks like

868
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,560
such a mean guy,

869
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,760
he won't compromise.

870
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,040
Can you make it?

871
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,470
Yeah.

872
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,920
No.

873
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,470
What's up?

874
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,350
My back is broken.

875
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,350
I can't do it.

876
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,950
I really can't.

877
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,760
Hurry up.

878
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,590
Send me to the infirmary.

879
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,800
- Be careful. Give me a hand.
- Qian Wei, are you alright?

880
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,470
No.

881
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,280
I need to go to the hospital.

882
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,430
I really can't do it.

883
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,110
In fact, I think

884
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,640
I can walk myself.

885
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,040
Come on.

886
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,190
Let's pick up the chairs.

887
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,760
Guys.

888
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,430
Come.

889
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,230
I'm good. I feel better now.

890
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,880
Come on.

891
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,110
Hurry up.

892
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,280
What're you doing?

893
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,560
Since you agreed to do it,

894
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,040
you have to finish it.

895
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,160
Give the chair to your sister.

896
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,280
Why do I need the chair?

897
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,520
I…

898
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,680
Is this necessary?

899
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,600
♪The shatters in my hands
turned into you♪

900
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,450
♪and filled my heart♪

901
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,370
♪I jumped into the trap myself♪

902
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,690
♪The shatters in my hands
turned into you♪

903
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,040
Come on, Zixin.

904
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,110
Get on my back, too.

905
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,520
Do you have design

906
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,000
on her?

907
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,040
So what?

908
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,110
Are you jealous?

909
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,350
You're just too strong

910
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,760
to be cared for.

911
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,190
Go, Zixin.

912
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,000
Make him tired.

913
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,160
Thank you.

914
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,070
Sure thing.

915
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,920
All right.

916
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,560
Let's go.

917
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,160
Thank you, Qian Chuan,

918
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,800
for carrying me so long.

919
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,950
The greatest merit of

920
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,830
we P. E. students is

921
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,920
our strength.

922
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,000
Plus I am

923
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,400
the most outstanding one

924
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,310
among my peers.

925
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,350
It's not a big deal.

926
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,070
Knock it off.

927
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,560
Qian Wei said that you were always

928
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,920
in the second place.

929
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,110
Liu Shiyun.

930
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,040
you're the only one who can talk?

931
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,400
Huh? You're mad?

932
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,470
You're so mean

933
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,800
for a guy so big.

934
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,680
So mean.

935
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,880
- So mean.
- Keep saying that again.

936
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,230
Whatever.

937
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,040
It's worth to make

938
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,920
Zixin smile.

939
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,590
You're so disgusting.

940
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,000
You're so greasy now?

941
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,880
Don't puke.

942
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,560
What're you doing?

943
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
My leg.

944
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,070
Why did you

945
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,280
hit my shoulder?

946
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

947
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,230
My sis has a night blindness.

948
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,800
She's blind at night.

949
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,680
Who's blind?

950
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,470
Look, it's so bright

951
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:01,950
at this place,

952
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,950
I can see anything clearly.

953
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,400
I…

954
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,640
Why are you so wordy?

955
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,760
Stop.

956
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,320
I'll kick your ass.

957
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,190
Wait.

958
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,040
Qian Chuan.

959
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,190
Zixin, help me to beat him.

960
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,840
You're so dead, Qian Chuan.

961
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,360
Sit closer.

962
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,150
Keep a fist's distance.

963
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,870
I really can see.

964
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,630
Why are you so kind today?

965
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,600
You helped us

966
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,630
and reminded me.

967
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,080
To make your prophecy fail.

968
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,190
Didn't you say

969
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,230
I wouldn't help you?

970
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,390
Then I'll make a prophecy again.

971
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,360
You'll be single in 10 years,

972
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,430
make me fail again.

973
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,390
I'm so tired

974
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,320
because of carrying you.

975
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,000

978

Come on.

979
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,320
She's playing with them. Come on.

So what?

1003

Our Qian Wei ranked

1004
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,470

1009
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,120
is so joyful here.

1010
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,760
I said nothing as the first place.

1011
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,840
I want to make more friends

1012
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,600

1013

1014
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,600
Why do you

1015
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,360
keep badgering me?

1016
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,080

1022

1023
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,560
Then you should know the competition

1024
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,600
for it is the fiercest one.

1025

1027
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,320

plenty of homework.

1114
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840

so much about the industry
as a freshman.

1116
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,630
Anyway,

1117
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,390
I never

1118
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,080
had a female student.

1119
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,760
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

1120
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,320
I get it.

1121
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,800
But I think

1122
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,910
I can change your mind.

1123
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,190
You are

1124
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,360
too wordy.

1125
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,120
Why do you think

1126
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,760
you can change my mind?

1127
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,280
I know the reason

1128
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,470
you refuse to accept female students.

1129
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,630
Once you had an outstanding student,

1130
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
a girl

1131
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,120
with good performance.

1132
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,710
Then she chose

1133
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,080
to get married

1134
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,190
and became a housewife.

1135
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,950
So you think girls a prone

1136
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,080
to be emotional

1137
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,390
and will give up career for love.

1138
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,390
Trust me,

1139
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,320
I won't.

(Interview)
Well,

1141
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,120
(Interview)
it's too early

1142
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,280
for a freshman to say that.

1143
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,950
Then I wish you could

1144
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,600
not jump to the conclusion so early.

1145
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,230
Look,

1146
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,230
just give me a chance

1147
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,630
by recruiting me

1148
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,120
and I'll prove it to you.

1149
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,120
Tell me the 3 characters

1150
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,670
you believe

1151
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,190
what a successful lawyer needs.

1152
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,080
Sincerity, kindness,

1153
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,560
erudite, careful reflection

1154
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,040
and

1155
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
good health.

1156
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,390
(Registration for the Debate Club Qian Wei)
Good health?

1157
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,470
I think

1158
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,000
lawyer is a career that causes

1159
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,670
too much pressure
and costs too much energy.

1160
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,950
Vitality is motivation.

1161
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,470
So we need to keep

1162
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,560
a good mental condition

1163
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,710
as well as physical one.

1164
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,910
So we can protect

1165
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,600
each client's interest.

1166
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,230
Why did you choose the laws as a major?

1167
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,840
Because of Descartes's words.

1168
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,000
Outstanding intelligence alone

1169
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,120
is not enough,

1170
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,040
what matters is

1171
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,910
how to use it wisely.

1172
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,600
What a coincidence.

1173
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,520
Chongwen

1174
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,840
was sitting there last year

1175
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,150
and was asked

1176
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,840
the same question by me.

1177
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,840
Chongwen.

1178
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,870
This student

1179
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,600
is a bit like you

1180
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,840
She has the same clear goal

1181
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,360
and same ambition.

1182
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,360
But

1183
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,670
she's more interesting than you.
