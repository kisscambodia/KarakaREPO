1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,960
Enjoy your meal.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,599
No matter how much you eat today,
it's my treat.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,000
It sounds like

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,520
you are often disappointed in love.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,920
Not like that.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,880
I always

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,319
couldn't win a person before.

8
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:15,399
Every time I lost,

9
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,920
I just came here for dessert.

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,280
Although my case

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,319
is different from yours,

12
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:21,799
the curative effect should be similar.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,439
Is it good?

14
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:48,799
Well.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,040
It's sweet.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,080
Screw you!

17
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:53,959
If you were really disappointed
in love,

18
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,439
how could you taste the sweetness?

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Tell me the truth.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Did you screw it up

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,639
or did you not care about it at all?

22
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,080
Didn't I?

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,639
Did I get the movie tickets

24
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,959
and book the dinner table?

25
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,080
Haven't I taken care of it yet?

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,599
You are striving to get to a point

27
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,360
when you would finally have enough.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,480
You were not ready

29
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,279
for the first night.

30
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,000
Why did you think about

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,919
the second night?

32
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,120
That's why
you would be caught unprepared.

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,639
Do you understand?

34
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:20,559
Did you say that

35
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,480
it's safe to

36
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,160
do according to your plan?

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,919
What happened then?

38
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:24,599
What are you doing now?

39
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,639
You are blaming me?

40
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,120
I don't think I should trust you.

41
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,639
What are you doing?

42
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:29,879
It's okay you failed once.

43
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,959
You have already spent the money.

44
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:33,199
No need to do that.

45
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,360
Just find a good friend

46
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,199
and go with him.

47
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:36,000
That's it.

48
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,599
I really can't stand you.

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,319
It's enough for you

50
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,040
to know this kind of thing yourself.

51
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,319
Do you have to make it
known to everyone?

52
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,400
I don't need them. Throw them away.

53
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,959
Give it to me. Give it to me!

54
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,599
I'll go with you, okay?

55
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,480
Is it helpful for you to accompany me?

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,040
Since I am the matchmaker,

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
I will be a responsible one.

58
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,680
You take this thing

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
as a barrier

60
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,639
on your way to love.

61
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:04,319
Even if it's hard,

62
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,360
I'll accompany you to overcome it today,

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,879
okay?

64
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,919
Can you do it?

65
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,880
Stop talking nonsense and eat quickly.

66
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,639
When you're finished, let's go.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,720
Which step did I make wrong?

68
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,039
Yes.

69
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,600
Which step is wrong?

70
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
You tell me.

71
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,360

73
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,759
But, why does Zixin…

74
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,360
Don't ask.

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,199
Once you ask,

76
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
it hurt me.

77
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,039
OK, I won't ask.

78
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,119
Eat quickly.

79
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,320
You ordered such a good steak.

80
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Don't waste it.

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,000
Eat it. Eat it.

82
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,199
This…

83
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,119
I don't want to eat it.

84
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,880
I lost my appetite.

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,160
I am too disappointed to cut it.

86
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,000
OK. OK. OK.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,320
I owe you, okay?

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll cut it for you.

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,320
You paid a lot

90
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,880
to be worthy

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,639
of Zixin's taste, didn't you?

92
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,880
Don't be too sad.

93
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,760
Actually,

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,279
This feeling of cutting money

95
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,040
is no worse than falling in love.

96
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,959
Here you are.

97
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,519
Eat it.

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,160
I lost my appetite.

99
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,559
You lost appetite.

100
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,200
What can I do?

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,679
I don't want to eat it.

102
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,480
It's expensive. Have a try.

103
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Take a bite.

104
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,399
Are you feeling better?

105
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,959
I haven't swallowed it yet.

106
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:57,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,760
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

108
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,480
And then

109
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,359
the effect of that meat

110
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:00,839
will just come up.

111
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,440
Come on.

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,480
Have a mouthful of meat
and a mouthful of wine,

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
and you will

114
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,040
get your energy back

115
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,239
right away.

116
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:05,839
Have a try.

117
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,279
I'm telling you.

118
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,679
If every time
after being disappointed in love,

119
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:18,640
I could eat like this.

120
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
Then I am willing
to be disappointed in love every day.

121
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,559
We are running out of time.

122
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,600
If you are finished,

123
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,320
let's hurry.

124
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,880
Check out, please.

125
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,359
According to your teaching,

126
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,239
I have a surprise for you

127
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,320
after dinner.

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
Would you like to have it?

129
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,600
What's the surprise?

130
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:45,720
Escaping the charge.

131
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,880
♪The debris in my hand turns into you♪

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,520
♪Fill the emptiness in my heart♪

133
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:03,320
♪I'm willing to jump into your trap♪

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,480
♪The debris in my hand turns into you♪

135
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,640
♪The stars in the sky are
like your eyes♪

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,440
♪I'll always be here♪

137
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,640
I really, really…

138
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,839
I really can't run.

139
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm telling you.

140
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,640
Your reputation's going to be
in the toilet.

141
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,320
You know the law but break the law.

142
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,839
Didn't you say that?

143
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,359
When dating,

144
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,119
make our heart beats

145
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:27,640
faster.

146
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,239
That will create unforgettable memories.

147
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,200
What is more unforgettable

148
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,119
than our Law students'

149
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,559
evasion?

150
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,519
Your education is complete.

151
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,320
You hurry back with me

152
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,079
and buy the order.

153
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,640
No way.

154
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
We'll miss the movie later.

155
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
It doesn't matter.

156
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,559
I can't watch a man of great charm

157
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,239
from law school

158
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:42,799
turn into

159
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,239
a juvenile delinquent

160
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:44,920
in Law in Action.

161
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,760
Come with me.

162
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,480
What about this?

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
(Western Restaurant on 52nd Street)

164
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,160
Are you kidding me?

165
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:00,760
Your poor trick.

166
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I almost believed it!

167
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,600
What's wrong with you.

168
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,799
Keep them.

169
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,559
Just say it.

170
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,359
In order to chase Zixin,

171
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,079
how many of these strange sweet dramas

172
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,359
have you watched?

173
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,640
What is a sweet drama?

174
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,920
Sweet drama.

175
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,200
Sweet drama is…

176
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,519
Like this!

177
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,880
Feel it?

178
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
You're rude!

179
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,880
Are you feeling sweet?

180
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,080
(Floating City)
(Love triangle of three people)

181
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,320
All right.

182
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,799
Stop hitting me.

183
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,839
I'm wrong, okay?

184
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,279
- No!
- Stop chasing me.

185
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,359
The assistant

186
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,640
confessed her love to the hero
but she was rejected.

187
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,040
She just walked away

188
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:37,920
What a shame!

189
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,679
I'm telling you.
It would be more embarrassing

190
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,519
if you like someone but do not confess.

191
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,440
You're not like them.

192
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,760
You're a real man.

193
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,839
But if it were me,

194
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,880
if I were not quite sure,

195
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,760
I wouldn't confess, either.

196
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,519
That's true.

197
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,239
Let's go eat something.

198
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,200
OK. Let's go.

199
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,760
You said you would accompany me.

200
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,600
But you also escaped.

201
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,079
What do you check it for?

202
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,040
We haven't finished watching the movie.

203
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,839
Does it make sense for you
to check the spoiler?

204
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,359
Let's have rice noodles.

205
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,079
Go.

206
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,799
You watch out.

207
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,160
I found it!

208
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,760
They said that

209
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,519
Aaron Kwok finally

210
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,640
returned to family

211
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,040
and stayed
with his childhood sweetheart.

212
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,079
He didn't choose the assistant.

213
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm telling you.

214
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
That's a good sign.

215
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,640
You will be with Zixin

216
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,679
smoothly.

217
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,720
It's all movies.

218
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,399
In reality,

219
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,200
how can there be
so many childhood sweethearts?

220
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,880
If I were me,

221
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,160
I must choose that assistant.

222
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
She could do anything.

223
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,119
Anything could be ordered.

224
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,079
And we could follow

225
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,920
the legal procedure

226
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,320
and let her

227
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,760
share some work for me.

228
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,239
Did you piss Zixin off

229
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,719
because of these

230
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,159
naive, frivolous and ignorant words?

231
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,320
Listen to me.

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,119
For you,

233
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,159
it's absolutely impossible

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,320
to be with your assistant.

235
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
Man's life is destined.

236
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,760
You are destined to be with your

237
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
childhood sweetheart.

238
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,239
Do you understand?

239
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,679
You'll never be with your assistant.

240
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,880
Then do you know
who will be my future assistant?

241
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,400
Who will it be?

242
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,000
It won't be Liu Xinyou anyway.

243
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Don't be discouraged.

244
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,520
It'll be

245
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,159
the sodality soon.

246
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,000
The person in charge of this time

247
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,599
is very close to being me.

248
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,479
I'll help you

249
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,520
remedy the situation.

250
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,359
Who knows what will happen
in the future?

251
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,559
You give my two tickets

252
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,440
back first.

253
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,880
We can't even see the movie.

254
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,599
What should we do?

255
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,559
I will pay for it.

256
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll treat you to this.

257
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,159
It's too cold. I don't want to eat it.

258
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,919
I want to eat that.

259
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,039
So picky.

260
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,520
Hi, I would like two ice creams.

261
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,880
OK.

262
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,520
Really.

263
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,840
Good performance can make money.

264
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
Have a drink.

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,520
Little beauty.

266
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,400
You look good.

267
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,239
Later,

268
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,520
how about we buy you a drink?

269
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
We're all single.

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,039
I don't need it. I don't have time.

271
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,200
No need.

272
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,799
Hands off.

273
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,559
Who are you?

274
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,200
My hand. My hand.

275
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
You stay here.

276
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,239
Come here, let me tell you something.

277
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:42,960
Come.

278
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,479
Forget it.

279
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,440
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

280
00:09:59,239 --> 00:09:59,919
Go.

281
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,919
What did you tell them

282
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,840
to make them leave?

283
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Nothing.

284
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,440
Just tell them that

285
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
you don't look good
when you remove your makeup.

286
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,559
It's not necessary
to be in the police station

287
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,559
because of this.

288
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,599
So they left.

289
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,679
You idiot!

290
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,359
Is it good?

291
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,239
Eat more if it's good!

292
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,119
Have some more!

293
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,679
The director
of Moral Education Department called.

294
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,239
I'm telling you.

295
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,760
I must be in charge this time.

296
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,799
Wait and see.

297
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,479
Hello, teacher.

298
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,320
Qian Wei.

299
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,400
People in charge of the sodality

300
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
are decided. You're one of them.

301
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,640
OK, thank you, teacher.

302
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,840
By the way,

303
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,559
and Li Chongwen, a sophomore.

304
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,239
This way. Get on the bus this way.

305
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:08,799
This way. This way.

306
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,200
Right. Right. Right.

307
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,159
Get on the bus here.

308
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,679
Hurry up. Hurry up.

309
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,479
This way. This way. This way.

310
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,520
Sodality,

311
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,880
the annual event of high popularity

312
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,080
of law school.

313
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,559
It's like a giant

314
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,520
youth hormone mixer,

315
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,400
it is brewing wonderful and fierce

316
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,760
chemical reactions,

317
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,799
but also creating

318
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,400
countless dangerous incidents.

319
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,239
At that time, this group of students

320
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,400
with excess hormones,

321
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,359
some drifted out of the water,

322
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,200
some turned out their home stay
and disappeared,

323
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,520
some tossed themselves allergic,

324
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,239
and some went to the hospital.

325
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,840
They said enough sincere words.

326
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,760
But I bore all dangerous events.

327
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,119
I lost my seat

328
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,200
on the presidium of the Students' Union

329
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,479
because of my poor work.

330
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,679
I'm in charge again this time.

331
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,840
I, Niohuru Prophet,

332
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,119
will never let it happen again!

333
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,080
I can make it!

334
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,039
Come on!

335
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,640
Pink leather clothes.

336
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,640
Where did this typhoon come from

337
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,280
to stir your young girl's heart?

338
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,400
Hello, classmate Qian Wei.

339
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,919
You applied to the school office

340
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,119
to transfer the school doctor's

341
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,159
entourage in case of accidents,
didn't you?

342
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,599
I'm Tang Lyu,
a school medical assistant.

343
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,679
I would appreciate your kind notice.

344
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,159
So you are the typhoon.

345
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,080
Sure.

346
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,520
I feel much more relieved with you.

347
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,280
Go on. Get on the bus.

348
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,760
You use public resources
for personal purpose.

349
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,520
I love you.

350
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,239
Come on. Go away.

351
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,080
You are so annoying.

352
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,640
Let me help you.

353
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,359
Her suitcase

354
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,760
shouldn't be so heavy, right?

355
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,799
Sure enough,

356
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,280
people in love are a little different
from before.

357
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,440
You are like a piece of white paper.

358
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,960
Are you qualified to judge others?

359
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,719
I'm telling you.

360
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:44,960
The opportunities are rare
in this sodality.

361
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,159
You should seize the opportunity.

362
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,359
Hurry and chase Zixin back.

363
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,000
You hear me?

364
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,400
Don't waste opportunities.

365
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,280
Don't talk nonsense.

366
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,479
Qian Wei

367
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,119
Isn't it all arranged?

368
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,919
The bus is too crowded.

369
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
Why is it so crowded?

370
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,359
Mainly because of the K Line.

371
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,599
The momentum of your stock

372
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,400
- is not good.
- Qian Wei, look.

373
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,479
The ones you chose

374
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,919
all hit the bottom and bounced back.

375
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,719
You still talk about the K Line?

376
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,599
You know what,

377
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,440
Zixin's Dad

378
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,520
is the real god of stocks.

379
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,200
It's not easy for me

380
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,960
to find this book.

381
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,760
The above case studies

382
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,000
can be called
the miracle of domestic stock history.

383
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,200
Sure enough, she is the daughter
of the invisible god of stocks.

384
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,239
Uncle Morris
must be particularly pleased.

385
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,320
How stupid you are!

386
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,200
Are they

387
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,239
really learning the stock market?

388
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,919
That's picking up girls.

389
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,119
I'm telling you.

390
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,359
Since Zixin made her first pot of gold

391
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,200
on the stock market.

392
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,679
Half of the boys in our school

393
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,239
now like to speculate
on the stock market.

394
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,000
What's it called?

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,239
It's called giving what one likes.

396
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,559
Can you learn something from them?

397
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,599
Are you talking about MPT?

398
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,520
You hurry!

399
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,200
Go and save the beauty!

400
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,119
Get rid of them all.

401
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,200
Forget it.

402
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,400
Nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

403
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,719
Don't you understand this truth?

404
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,359
You hurry…You!

405
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:51,799
You!

406
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,080
All right, I will help you to do it.

407
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,080
It's hard to have this opportunity.

408
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,760
I can't let these stupid guys seize it.

409
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,640
You guys.

410
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,719
All right. All right.

411
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,479
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

412
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,039
Hurry up.

413
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,000
You all have seats.

414
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,320
Go back to your seats.

415
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,000
How can we keep safe?

416
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,479
I'm telling you.

417
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,599
You guys are the biggest

418
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,239
hidden danger!

419
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:10,760
Go.

420
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,840
There are ten minutes left.

421
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,640
What's your hurry?

422
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,200
Yes.

423
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,919
- Yes.
- We're talking about stocks with Zixin.

424
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,880
Do you understand?

425
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,039
About what stocks?

426
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,359
You have to sit according

427
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,320
to…

428
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,159
Classmate.

429
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,679
This K Line is the one above,

430
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,679
not below.

431
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,919
And this classmate.

432
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,520
What Markowitz said was

433
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,320
the best investment choice

434
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,960
is to develop investment diversification

435
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
to reduce risk

436
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,599
under the background

437
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,520
of weighing risk and return.

438
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,239
This is the Modern Portfolio Theory,

439
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,119
MPT for short.

440
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,239
Also,

441
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,760
you see, there are so many people
on this bus.

442
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,880
There's no room for you gods of stocks.

443
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,719
There's a bus next to it.

444
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,880
Go to that bus and quarrel yourselves.

445
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,280
OK.

446
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,799
Go, go, go.

447
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,200
You go back to your seats.

448
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,679
Hurry up!

449
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,320
Forget it. Forget it.

450
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,440
Wait until we arrive at the destination.

451
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,520
Come on. Take it. Take it.

452
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
Thank you, senior.

453
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,559
Qian Wei, did you get hit?

454
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,400
No. Don't worry.

455
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,000
If they come back

456
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,679
and bother you again,

457
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,599
you'll let them call me.

458
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,960
Why are you going?

459
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,840
I have my own seat.

460
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,440
They're all gone.

461
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,039
It's all empty.

462
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,039
Just sit here.

463
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,960
My bag is still over there.

464
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,760
I'll take a seat over there first.

465
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
The effect of guarding

466
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,719
are the same.

467
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,320
I'll go first.

468
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,840
(Fantawild Dreamland)

469
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,920
(Dream Theater)

470
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
(Boonie Bears)

471
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,159
Zixin, sit with me.

472
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,960
The seats are all arranged.

473
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,400
Let's listen to the person in charge.

474
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,080
We are not at school.

475
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,200
We can change seats. It's okay.

476
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,719
Yes.

477
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,159
What are you guys doing?

478
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,799
Don't you see this seating chart?

479
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,880
It is written clearly that

480
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,039
the one with Zixin

481
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,440
is Lu Xun, okay?

482
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,919
Why do you have the final say?

483
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,200
Don't we have a choice?

484
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

485
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,000
You have.

486
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,039
You can sit in a boat with me.

487
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,080
Shall we play together?

488
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,039
- Come on.
- Come on.

489
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,599
Zixin.

490
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:27,400
Later, if you think

491
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
it's a little dangerous,

492
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,159
you can catch Lu Xun.

493
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,200
He will protect you.

494
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,599
Thank you.

495
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,359
You go ahead. Go.

496
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,119
I'm a little afraid of water.

497
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,440
I won't drive the boat either.

498
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
Or I'll give it up?

499
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
What are you afraid of?

500
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,719
I'm more scared than you.

501
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,599
I'm telling you.

502
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,960
I specially prepared

503
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,000
life jackets and lifebuoys

504
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,080
to each ship.

505
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,320
I'm afraid someone will drown.

506
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,320
Even if Zixin
wants to bungee jump today,

507
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,599
you have to accompany her, okay?

508
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,159
Hurry up.

509
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,960
This.

510
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,919
You'll put it on for Zixin later.

511
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,080
Fasten it tight, okay?

512
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,880
Fasten it tight.

513
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,599
Go. Go.

514
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,239
Come on. Come on!

515
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,439
Bye-bye.

516
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,520
Qian Wei.

517
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,800
Let's go.

518
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Let's get on the boat together.

519
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,760
What are you doing here?

520
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,439
Shouldn't you stay with Liu

521
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,439
and others?

522
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,400
Come on. Why is he here?

523
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:32,520
Zixin.

524
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,079
How boring it is to drive
with two people.

525
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,359
We can sit together.

526
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,959
I drive very well.

527
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,880
I can teach you.

528
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,839
It seems that

529
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,079
he signed up voluntarily.

530
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,119
I said

531
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,920
to the counselor in the Department.

532
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,760
He was the brother
of the person in charge.

533
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,680
He has the privilege.

534
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,680
But it's good.

535
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,800
You happened to be here.

536
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,199
We can come together, right?

537
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,479
There's only one boat left.

538
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,199
There's no way.

539
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's get on the boat.

540
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,640
Come on.

541
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,479
Oh, no.

542
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,199
At that time, Qian Chuan also followed.

543
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,959
Will that happen…

544
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,319
I want this bubble machine, too.

545
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,599
Give it to me, please.

546
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,920
Be careful. You sit down.

547
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,520
It's okay. Give it to me, please.

548
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,239
You see.

549
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,359
Look, look.

550
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:22,800
They kissed!

551
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,199
Look, look.

552
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,800
What are you doing?

553
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,400
So romantic.

554
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,599
I knew the god likes to tease me.

555
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,079
Fortunately, I prepared.

556
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,400
I don't believe that I couldn't get rid of
this strange relationship.

557
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,520
Why are you wearing a mask on the boat?

558
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,199
Waterproof?

559
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,359
I caught cold.

560
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,040
I am afraid of infecting you.

561
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,880
Just in case.

562
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,719
Lu Xun.

563
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,280
I've sacrificed a lot this time.

564
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,760
You must remember my

565
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,599
great kindness.

566
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,959
Qian Chuan, come ashore quickly.

567
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,079
Tang Lyu feels uncomfortable.

568
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,239
That thing last time

569
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,199
was over.

570
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,319
We will still be friends, right?

571
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,040
Yes, of course.

572
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,079
Front! Front!

573
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:28,959
Mo Zixin's there.

574
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,280
Watch out.

575
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,479
Be careful!

576
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,760
Help!

577
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,079
Someone fell into the water.

578
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,239
Help!

579
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,520
Somebody!

580
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,079
Come on, someone's overboard!

581
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,760
- Help! Somebody!
- Someone fell into the water.

582
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:55,880
Help!

583
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,119
Somebody!

584
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:00,880
I told you that

585
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,959
don't drive around.

586
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,599
Now

587
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,479
someone fainted.

588
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,280
Who would have thought

589
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
that thing could break?

590
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,959
Yes.

591
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,319
Zixin has already called someone
for help.

592
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,119
Don't panic yet.

593
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,319
School doctor!

594
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,680
He swam across the river.

595
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,239
Who can apply artificial respiration?

596
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,520
This… I…

597
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,319
God, I admit defeat…

598
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,400
You defeat me.

599
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,319
I'll do it.

600
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,520
Well, I can do that.

601
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,319
I've learned a little before.

602
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,479
Artificial respiration.

603
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,560
I can do it.

604
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:38,959
I…

605
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,160
I'm sorry.

606
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,479
Well.

607
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,199
Don't tell the teacher

608
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,280
of the Students' Union

609
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,800
about it, okay?

610
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,239
They didn't expect this to happen.

611
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,079
Don't worry.

612
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,479
It's not your fault.

613
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
I didn't stand firm myself.

614
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,800
If you don't mind,

615
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,920
just listen to you.

616
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,599
Three of you. Watch out next time.

617
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm sorry.

618
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm sorry.

619
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,479
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

620
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,160
I'll help you.

621
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,439
Thanks.

622
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,239
It's disgusting.

623
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,439
Don't talk to me.

624
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,479
Recently…

625
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,040
No.

626
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,640
Recent month.

627
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,400
Don't let me see you.

628
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
Especially your mouth.

629
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,040
It's disgusting.

630
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,359
Go and change your clothes.

631
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,199
Don't catch cold.

632
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,239
What's up?

633
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,119
Feeling shy?

634
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,680
He is talking to you.

635
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,280
Why don't you listen to him?

636
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,319
Really.

637
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,520
It's not that terrible.

638
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
I saw that picture just now.

639
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,680
Very beautiful.

640
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,680
It looks like you're

641
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,319
particularly heroic

642
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,319
and act bravely.

643
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,640
It's disgusting.

644
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,119
Don't mention it in the future.

645
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,839
It's disgusting.

646
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,960
(Ghost Ship)

647
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,439
What kind of scream does Tang Lyu like?

648
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,560
I am so scared.

649
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,079
Or you're great, Tang Lyu!

650
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
Forget it.

651
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,400
Just wait and see.

652
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,280
Anyway, Qian Chuan will help me then.

653
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,199
Hero saves beauty in ghost house.

654
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,560
With Liu Shiyun's help,

655
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,520
Zixin will definitely

656
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,760
falls in love with me.

657
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,479
These people

658
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,880
each harbors evil intentions.

659
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,199
Don't think that I don't know.

660
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,839
No one can succeed with me here.

661
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,400
(Zhu Gong)

662
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,800
Aren't you satisfied?

663
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,560
If it weren't for the only suit
in the store,

664
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,400
I'm telling you,

665
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,839
I don't want you

666
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,880
to take advantage of it.

667
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,400
I'm saving your life.

668
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,680
It would be nice for me

669
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,439
not ask you to make a commitment.

670
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,359
What are you talking about?

671
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,520
Male chauvinist.

672
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,359
Li Chongwen will take a rest first.

673
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,880
He won't come for the time being.

674
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,520
Then I can only plead with him again

675
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
later.

676
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,560
What?

677
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,319
Nothing.

678
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,479
Well.

679
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,400
Then let him rest first.

680
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Let's have fun first.

681
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,760
Well, now that we've decided

682
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,280
to go into the ghost house.

683
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,199
Then rush in!

684
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,800
Go!

685
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,160
OK.

686
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:58,719
Let's go!

687
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,400
What do you want?

688
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,160
Are you scared?

689
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,079
It doesn't matter if you're afraid.

690
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,280
I can barely protect you.

691
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,000
Ask me.

692
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,839
Ask you for what.

693
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,839
Talk less.

694
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,560
I'm telling you.

695
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,280
I've explored the way

696
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,079
for you inside.

697
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,640
This ghost house

698
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,680
is not that scary at all.

699
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,800
At first,

700
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,520
there will be

701
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,680
a white-robed ghost out.

702
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,280
In that case,

703
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,319
just protect Zixin.

704
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,920
She must have fallen into your arms.

705
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,479
Then you go to the far left.

706
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,439
Go that way.

707
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,319
The whole process

708
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,199
may not be so terrifying,

709
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:21,959
but it's enough for Zixin.

710
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,599
Absolutely enough.

711
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,599
Just protect her.

712
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,280
You know?

713
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,599
I'll be in charge of Qian Chuan.

714
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,280
He knows

715
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,040
I have night blindness anyway.

716
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,280
I'll hold him then.

717
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,959
Today, you can

718
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,599
hold the beauty back, friend!

719
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,760
You have night blindness

720
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,160
but you still go into the ghost house?

721
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,760
I'm night blind. I'm not blind.

722
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,160
I can see it, too.

723
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,839
You don't have to worry about this.

724
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,319
Just protect Zixin.

725
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:38,760
Do you understand?

726
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:39,520
I'm telling you.

727
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
When she feels most terrified,

728
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,479
it's your best time

729
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,520
to put your arms around her.

730
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,119
See?

731
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,680
What are you doing again?

732
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,040
I'm telling you.

733
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,719
I'm ready for wedding candies.

734
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,760
Hurry in and cheer up.

735
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,599
Go.

736
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,920
Come on, hurry.

737
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,880
Just hold tight, okay?

738
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,959
The kind of suffocation.

739
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,040
Line up here.

740
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,400
I have no problem. You believe…

741
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:15,800
What's up?

742
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,400
Where are you?

743
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,920
I can't see, Qian Chuan.

744
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,719
What are you screaming at?

745
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,640
There are dummies around here.

746
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,880
Everything's…Everything's fine.

747
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,680
Help! Help!

748
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,719
Hurry! Hurry!

749
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,560
Come on. Come on. Come on.

750
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,520
Let's go.

751
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,880
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

752
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,920
Brother, is that you?

753
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,640
It's me.

754
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,040
How's it going?

755
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:53,680
I found the Tang Lyu.

756
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,560
He's on my side.

757
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,000
What about you?

758
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,199
I'll give Zixin to you right away.

759
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,800
A pleasant cooperation.

760
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,319
Zixin. Let's move on.

761
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:03,959
You follow me.

762
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,640
There is Qian Chuan ahead.

763
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,079
Don't worry.

764
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,719
Don't be afraid, Zixin.

765
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:06,439
It's all fake.

766
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,319
Follow me.

767
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,119
Don't be afraid, Zixin.

768
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,160
I'm here.

769
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:14,959
Come.

770
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,359
Senior.

771
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,800
You see.

772
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
From a medical perspective,

773
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,560
this man

774
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,760
should have died of blunt force

775
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,839
hitting his skull.

776
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,000
Look, there's a hole here.

777
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:28,959
Did you see that?

778
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,319
In terms of stress area

779
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,680
of this hole…

780
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,199
So terrible!

781
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,040
- Senior, I'm scared.
- It's okay. It's okay.

782
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:34,520
Don't worry.

783
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,760
Senior.

784
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,119
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

785
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,760
Just go straight down this road.

786
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,239
You hear me?

787
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:47,479
Don't turn.

788
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,599
That's what my brother should do.

789
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:56,920
I'm telling you.

790
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,199
It's absolutely right
that I just grabbed you.

791
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,119
Are you walking the right way?

792
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,160
You're very strong.

793
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,119
You are good.

794
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,680
What are you doing?

795
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,079
You want to win Zixin

796
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,000
from Lu Xun.

797
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,479
I'm telling you.

798
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,719
Don't look at him like that.

799
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,800
He looks weak.

800
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,000
But I've seen his skill.

801
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,920
He's great.

802
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,280
You may not be able to defeat him.

803
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
What are you doing? Let's go.

804
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,520
Hurry up.

805
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,319
Hurry, hurry.

806
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,520
Hurry!

807
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,439
Don't fall behind.

808
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,520
Can you remind me of the steps?

809
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,280
Why it's you?

810
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,239
Why me?

811
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,959
Do you mean to ask me that?

812
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,760
I've always been the one you're holding.

813
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,199
The person you touch

814
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,359
is me, too!

815
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,319
Well.

816
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,400
Except for good looking

817
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,319
and this weak body,

818
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,239
anything else to add?

819
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,040
Sorry…

820
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,599
But what about the others?

821
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,439
A sorry

822
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:18,319
to send me away?

823
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,239
Others should

824
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,199
take other exits.

825
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,040
If something goes wrong again,

826
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,680
I'll really lose this time.

827
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,119
What lose?

828
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,920
What are you talking about?

829
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,800
I'm in charge of this activity.

830
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,599
That is,

831
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,680
if there is an accident,

832
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,359
the responsibility lies with me.

833
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,040
Let's meet others.

834
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,680
Wait.

835
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,760
Who just held me tight?

836
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,800
Now you want to run away?

837
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,079
What do you want then?

838
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Win a present for me,

839
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,119
as a sealing fee.

840
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,560
Sure enough, this is a familiar scene.

841
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
Very familiar.

842
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,800
(Legal Methods and Modern Civil Law)
If I remember correctly,

843
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,680
Lu Xun will ask for the book

844
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,280
next.

845
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,800
See.

846
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,439
That book is out of print.

847
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,199
(Legal Methods and Modern Civil Law)
I want that one.

848
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,520
No.

849
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,560
You're almost tried

850
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,439
more than 200 times.

851
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,439
You couldn't get that book.

852
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,560
Just go.

853
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,199
The shopkeeper will close the stall.

854
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
It is easy for you to say.

855
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,680
You get one for me.

856
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,079
Come on. Go ahead.

857
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,719
Come on. Go ahead.

858
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I can't defeat you on learning.

859
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,280
I could defeat you on playing.

860
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,839
A little slanting.

861
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,719
You can't cover it like that.

862
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,839
You breathe.

863
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,119
I've asked that

864
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,520
it will take two hours

865
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,239
for an ambulance coming

866
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,680
from the nearest hospital nearby.

867
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,199
Why didn't you say it earlier

868
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,640
that you're allergic to dog hair?

869
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,719
Go. Go. Go.

870
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,000
What are you doing?

871
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,000
Let's go.

872
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:06,640
Where to?

873
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,239
Go.

874
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,280
Come on, let me help you.

875
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,880
Because of that allergy,

876
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,479
Lu Xun missed the best opportunity

877
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,640
for confession in the sodality.

878
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,400
Qian Chuan took the lead.

879
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,239
In order to make amends,

880
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,239
I spent a lot of money

881
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,520
to buy that out-of-print book
and gave it to Lu Xun.

882
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,280
The last one. You do it.

883
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,319
I can't.

884
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm so unlucky.

885
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,119
You play it.

886
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,000
Can you?

887
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,800
This is the last one.

888
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,040
The probability of two people doing
may be a little higher.

889
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,199
I've just tried so many times.

890
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,359
The probability is on you.

891
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,160
What if you got one

892
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,959
directly?

893
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,079
Come on. Come on.

894
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,040
Your turn.

895
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,599
It's like you can get it.

896
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,280
What's your luck?

897
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,959
You can even get that one!

898
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,000
Hit the jackpot.

899
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,520
Handsome man, congratulations!

900
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:16,880
Don't bring it.

901
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,280
Just put it here. Just put it here.

902
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,280
Just put it here.

903
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,520
It makes no difference for you couple.

904
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,359
No hurry.

905
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,439
He's allergic to dog hair.

906
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,079
Therefore…

907
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,800
How do you know
I'm allergic to dog hair?

908
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,000
I dreamed of it.

909
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,479
I am a prophet.

910
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,319
Dream of it?

911
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,599
What else did you dream about?

912
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:40,040
It doesn't matter what I dream about.

913
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,319
Just stay away from it.

914
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,760
Can we deposit it here?

915
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,160
Fine.

916
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,800
Come with me.

917
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,160
Why don't you
row the Ferris wheel first?

918
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
I'll come as soon as I've solved it.

919
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,599
Bye.

920
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,239
She knows me.

921
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:57,479
If you really want it,

922
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,920
I'll give you this number.

923
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,439
Come on.

924
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,160
You think you're lying to

925
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,479
an 18-year-old girl?

926
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,119
I know what's the price of this book

927
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,599
in my heart.

928
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,640
Two hundred and fifty yuan.

929
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,680
Give it to me if you want.

930
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,560
If you don't want to. Then forget it.

931
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,119
It cost me 250 yuan at that time.

932
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:12,880
I know

933
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
your reserve price quite a lot.

934
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,079
Sure.

935
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,839
Since you like it so much,

936
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,959
you have a connection with this book.

937
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,079
Then I'll give up my love.

938
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,239
You've had a long day.

939
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,959
Please help me to send the little dog

940
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:24,839
to the home stay on the mountain.

941
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,319
I got it. Don't worry.

942
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,920
Still not high enough.

943
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
I can't see it.

944
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,520
It's a pity for that book.

945
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,079
I guess it's hard to buy it
anywhere else.

946
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,800
Stop nagging about it.

947
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,719
You stole it?

948
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,359
Can you talk nicely?

949
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:57,839
I'm telling you.

950
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,040
I've been bargaining with him
for a long time.

951
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,119
It cost price

952
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,239
worthy of you.

953
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,400
Cherish it.

954
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,319
My price?

955
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,959
What price is worthy of me?

956
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,479
250?

957
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,599
You said it yourself.

958
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,599
I am not saying that.

959
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,199
But this price…

960
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,040
This price…

961
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,359
I bargained it myself.

962
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,959
He asked me for 500 yuan.

963
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,839
Price bargaining is my skill.

964
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,040
So this book

965
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,160
and the money for the cherry.

966
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,599
Let's wipe them out.

967
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,079
You're good at counting.

968
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,640
Why don't you major in accounting?

969
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,280
Why don't you change your career?

970
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,000
You must be particularly excellent
in the future.

971
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,839
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
