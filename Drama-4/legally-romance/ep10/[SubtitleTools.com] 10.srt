1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,200
This is procedural justice.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,360
It is the foundation for the realization
of substantive justice.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,150
You mean

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,800
if the procedure is destroyed

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,150
and rules overturned,

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,000
the law has no meaning.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,150
Even though

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,000
we feel sorry about the victims…

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,680
If they lack legal awareness

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,280
and didn't save strong evidence,

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,200
even if we want to help them,

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,120
there is no way for us to start.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,790
So after today,

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,270
this reinforced

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,360
one of my thoughts.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,560
At the time I have money

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,040
and get enough ability and energy,

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm going to run a non-profit

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,950
legal aid platform.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,080
With it, we not only handle cases,

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,240
but also popularize the law

22
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,310
more broadly.

23
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,040
I think that's a good idea.

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,910
How could you think of doing this?

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,240
Actually this is what

26
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,040
I want to do most after graduation.

27
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,040
But Li Chongwen doesn't support me.

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Later I worked in Zhanying

29
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,000
and told Director Tao about this.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,590
He didn't give me a response, either.

31
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,680
If I can start it over now,

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,480
I'm going to do whatever

33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
I want to do.

34
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,760
Look.

35
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,680
These cases

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,310
we were consulted today

37
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,080
actually

38
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,830
are trifling matters.

39
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,590
But because

40
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,830
people lack legal awareness,

41
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,870
they missed the best time

42
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,680
to protect themselves.

43
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,590
You know, sometimes

44
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,160
compared with my failure,

45
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,720
the thing that makes me sadder is

46
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,270
I could've made it.

47
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,400
So, I don't want

48
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,160
more fairness and justice

49
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,440
are devoured because of ignorance.

50
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,270

What do you want?

67
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,880
This afternoon,
I will have the first date

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,470
with Tang Lyu.

69
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,390
So, I came to ask you

70
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,470
for advice.

71
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,670
Me?

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,390
Help me

73
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,520
choose the best outfit for dating,

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,080
which can blow Tang Lyu's mind.

75
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,630
Love drives people crazy.

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,350
Even a tomboy

77
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,790
learns to behave like a girl.

78
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,950
Cut the crap!

79
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,920
Give me a good choice.

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,070
Or you'll see.

81
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,700
(For Women For Men)

82
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,320
Are you going to prick Tang Lyu

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,270
with your rivets?

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,670
The first date focuses
on winning his heart,

85
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,830
not his head.

86
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,670
Stop it! Stop it!

87
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,230
Brother, please don't put me
on the spot.

88
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,920
Can you wear a little bit

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,830
decent clothes?

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,160
Stop it!

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,070
Are you going for a fight or a date?

92
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,350
Not satisfied?

93
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,830
These are my most expensive clothes.

94
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,600
All right.

95
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,920
Send Buddha to the West.

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,110
To assure

97
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,320
you have a successful date tonight,

98
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,550
I will be responsible

99
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,040
for your clothes.

100
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,110
Get changed.

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,670
No way.

102
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,550
I would die here

103
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,270
today

104
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,670
rather than

105
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,950
wear this girlish dress.

106
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,200
What's the most important thing
for a relationship?

107
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Do what he likes!

108
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Tang Lyu likes

109
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,070
a sweet girl.

110
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,200
Clean and pure.

111
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,110
Not a rock girl, okay?

112
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,350
To live or love?

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,390
Think about it yourself.

114
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,640
Impossible.

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm not even gonna wear it.

116
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,480
What are you doing?

117
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,510
No, why here?

118
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,200
Oh, my God.

119
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,070
Just listen to me.

120
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,200
Hello, sir.

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,550
I'm a regular customer here.

122
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,950
Why do you bring me here?

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,040
Do some skin care for her

124
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,510
to make her skin bright

125
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,390
immediately.

126
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,760
It'd better make

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
her skin look clean and smooth

128
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,920
as a shelled egg

129
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,390
Is there that skin care?

130
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,880
Miss Liu,

131
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,390
you always hydrate your skin

132
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,880
all the time.

133
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
I think

134
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
he wants you

135
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,110
to try out

136
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,040
timeless youthful skin care.

137
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,760
You can rest assured.

138
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,110
It must work very well.

139
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,920
Fine.

140
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,070
- This way, Miss Liu.
- Go.

141
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,790
This way, please.

142
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,230
Come on.

143
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,640
Go, go!

144
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,000
I never did it, I…

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,950
Go. Go.

146
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,390
Go.

147
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,600
Go.

148
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,880
Shiyun,

149
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,880
you look special today.

150
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,200
Yeah?

151
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,070
I… I feel awkward, too.

152
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,200
Not awkward.

153
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,440
You look very pretty.

154
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,950
The wine

155
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,390
is directly delivered here by air

156
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,480
from its country of origin.

157
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Do you want a taste?

158
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,510
Okay.

159
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:58,950
Here.

160
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,000
Cheers.

161
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,920
Cheers.

162
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,070
How is it?

163
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,040
This wine is not strong enough.

164
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,950
It's so hot.

165
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,760
I

166
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,510
don't even drink much.

167
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,720
I always drink warm water.

168
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,480
I am inconsiderate.

169
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,390
Waitress.

170
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,350
Bring us a lemonade.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,200
Thank you.

172
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,320
Miss, what else can I do

173
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,350
for you?

174
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,520
It's okay.

175
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,150
I just choked a little.

176
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,520
Please help us

177
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
open the window.

178
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,960
Waitress.

179
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,200
Hello.

180
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,590
What smell is this?

181
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,440
Why is it so stinky?

182
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,030
Sorry, sir.

183
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,790
Nearby is a restaurant
selling river snails rice noodles.

184
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,910
Its taste is strong.

185
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,760
In order not to affect customers,

186
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
we don't usually open windows.

187
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
A qualified western restaurant

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,470
not only guarantees
the quality of the dishes

189
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,320
but also takes into account

190
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,760
the dining environment.

191
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,470
How could there be such a restaurant

192
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,400
on the opposite side?

193
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,910
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,470
No way. I'm gonna report it.

195
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,030
Smelly? I think it smells good.

196
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,200
You like these?

197
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,550
No, no, no.

198
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,880
How could it be possible?

199
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,030
I just think

200
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,840
it's not easy

201
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,590
to open a restaurant.

202
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,790
Just forget it.

203
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,910
Please close the window.

204
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,280
Okay.

205
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,320
You know what?

206
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,550
The taste of river snails rice noodles

207
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,520
is mainly
from pickled sour bamboo shoots.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,280
In the fermentation process,

209
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,550
two amino acids are transformed.

210
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,400
One is hydrogen sulfide.

211
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,280
The other is skatole.

212
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,760
Essentially,

213
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,400
river snails rice noodles

214
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,400
taste the same as excrement.

215
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,440
But don't worry.

216
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,880
I won't allow my girlfriend

217
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,590
to eat

218
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,880
this kind of humble food.

219
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,520
It turns out

220
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,440
I not only am humble,

221
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,790
but also like to eat humble food.

222
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,000
Shiyun, you really needn't me
to give you a ride?

223
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,200
I needn't.

224
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
My roommates happen to live nearby.

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,470
After our date,

226
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,910
I want to get together with them.

227
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,840
Okay.

228
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,760
Take care on the way.

229
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,350
Okay.

230
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,520
When you arrive, send me a message.

231
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,960
Okay.

232
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,760
Bye.

233
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,640
Bye.

234
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,000
Bye.

235
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,550
Oh, my God!

236
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,280
The food is expensive and unpalatable.

237
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,840
How could it be ranked

238
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,110
in the Food of the Year?

239
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,940
(River snails rice noodles)

240
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,400
Smells good.

241
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,200
What are you doing here?

242
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,590
Come on.

243
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,030
You are athletes.

244
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,350
But you came all the way to eat here.

245
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,230
You are really idle.

246
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,150
You don't understand.

247
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,200
It's called love.

248
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm V-V-VIP

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,230
of this restaurant.

250
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,590
I found this place by accident.

251
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,440
And then I become addicted
after eating once.

252
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,590
What happened to you?

253
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,590
This isn't like a place

254
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,440
where a couple would come
after the first date.

255
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,440
Forget it.

256
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,590
I felt very uncomfortable

257
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,230
when having dinner with Tang Lyu.

258
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,520
The western food

259
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,230
is expensive and unpalatable.

260
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,230
More seriously,
I have to behave well all the time.

261
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,880
If I hadn't heard of

262
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,840
this restaurant here,

263
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,910
I couldn't make it through at all.

264
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,670
And finally, Tang Lyu told me

265
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,350
a lot of

266
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,230
chemistry terms.

267
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,110
He means that

268
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,110
eating river snails rice noodles
is eating shit.

269
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,670
I'm so pissed.

270
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,840
This is the price

271
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,080
of falling in love with a super scholar.

272
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Stop laughing.

273
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,030
When will you pay a price?

274
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,840
For Zixin.

275
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,030
I wish.

276
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,550
But she's been avoiding me lately.

277
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,790
I can only turn love

278
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,840
into an appetite.

279
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,080
If I don't fall in love,

280
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,440
I can eat whatever I want.

281
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,520
It's also pretty good.

282
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,520
Aren't you full?

283
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm buying you.

284
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,550
Madam.

285
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,910
A bowl of signature rice noodles.

286
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Madam,

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,350
give me another half a dozen beers.

288
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,200
Okay.

289
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,550
This humblest shack
of a restaurant is amazing.

290
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,150
Cool!

291
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,880
Drink it.

292
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,960
Drink. Cheers.

293
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,880
Come on! Come on!

294
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,760
Come on. Drink it up.

295
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,230
Look at your dress.

296
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,670
What will you wear on your next date?

297
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,320
It looks much more comfortable now.

298
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,030
- Come on.
- Come on. Drink it up.

299
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,440
If I had known that setting up a stall
would make money,

300
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,350
I should have tried.

301
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,000
Listen,

302
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,230
I would make a great fortune.

303
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,320
You will also be beaten
by the conductor.

304
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,470
Only for couples.

305
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,520
(Pre-sale of concert tickets)
Ten years later, if the couple

306
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,840
(Pre-sale of concert tickets)
enters the venue with their own tickets,

307
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,520
all ticket fees will be refunded.

308
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,080
There is no possibility of losing money.

309
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,200
My parents would have been very excited

310
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,230
if they had known this.

311
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,320
(Ten-year Promise Signing Session)

312
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,150
Anyway, people like me

313
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,590
who are as close as wax

314
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,320
see that

315
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
they voluntarily pay,

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,590
but not for me,

317
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,910
I feel very uncomfortable.

318
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,590
Have you asked Yuzhou?

319
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,280
Lu Xun is so persevering.

320
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,760
Can't he move Zixin?

321
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Anyway, judging from
the last law popularization

322
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
and fellowship activity,

323
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:49,960
it's hard.

324
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,230
This concert

325
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,350
is very important to me.

326
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,440
Could you think of a way?

327
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
There is no other way.

328
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,590
Lu Xun.

329
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,230
Is this what you want?

330
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,440
How could you…?

331
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,880
I think Yuzhou

332
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,150
might suddenly figure it out.

333
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,080
(Ten-year Promise Signing Session)
(Great)

334
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,030
(Ten-year Promise Signing Session)
(My subline task)

335
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,230
(has finally progressed)

336
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,320
(This time, Zixin took the initiative)

337
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,840
(to send the ticket to Lu Xun)

338
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
(There is no way)

339
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,320
(that it fails)

340
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,000
I think

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
you look sad.

342
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,080
It's because of money.

343
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,350
Let's go.

344
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,640
Maybe there will be a miracle.

345
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,520
And they would be together.

You've been in Law Department

369
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,710
for an academic year.

370
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,590
I believe you have a clear vision

371
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,670
of your future

372
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,910
and profession.

373
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,030
Although the wish bottles

374
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,000
can't help you succeed,

375
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,470
they can

376
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,400
at least make you remember

377
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,520
your original aspiration.

378
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,440
Ten years

379
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,000
sounds like a long time,

380
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,150
but it's just a blink of an eye.

381
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,840
Please write your wish on paper

382
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,350
and put it in the bottle.

383
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,430
Put the wish bottles

384
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,640
in these two boxes in the front.

385
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,470
I have a meeting.

386
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,280
Qian Wei.

387
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,110
After everyone finishes writing,

388
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,350
collect the bottles

389
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,680
and send them to my office.

390
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,400
Okay.

391
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,590
Are you wishing so much

392
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,520
that one piece of paper is not enough?

393
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,640
Do I have to get another one for you

394
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,560
from Professor Zhen?

395
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,680
Am I such a person?

396
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,110
Only kids dream of

397
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,400
making their dreams come true.

398
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,070
Adults only believe
that it all depends on human effort.

399
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,880
So sensible?

400
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,590
Seriously?

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
Of course it's fake.

402
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,590
If I believe this,

403
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,590
why am I writing so much?

404
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,400
Well.

405
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,830
Even if you work hard,
you will not necessarily succeed.

406
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,470
But if you keep wishful thinking,

407
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,470
your dream will come to nothing.

408
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,310
So I think

409
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,760
you have to be brave

410
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,190
to fight for it.

411
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,760
You have to try

412
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,520
but not always wait.

413
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,160
Are you trying to get me?

414
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,560
Don't worry.

415
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,590
When my wish comes true,

416
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,760
I will definitely tell you.

417
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,830
Do I still have to guess your wish?

418
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,070
Of course

419
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,000
it's for Zixin.

420
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,710
So stubborn.

421
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,230
Everyone.

422
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,070
Just write and hand it in.

423
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,470
Whatever you want to do,

424
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,280
you have to do it yourself.

425
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
It's useless

426
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,830
to write it on paper.

427
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,590
Just write

428
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,000
and let them rest in peace.

429
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,920
Come on.

430
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,040
Don't hesitate.

431
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,830
Even Einstein

432
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,070
had a dream about the violin.

433
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,430
As a student of Law Department,

434
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,070
of course you could

435
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,190
have a dream of music.

436
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,400
Show your attitude

437
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,070
as a tigress.

438
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,760
Qian Wei,

439
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,070
will my wish come true?

440
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,880
I can't feel it.

441
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,400
But listen.

442
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,560
If you don't try it now,

443
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,280
no matter how much money you make
in ten years,

444
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,950
you'll regret it.

445
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,470
Zixin, what did you write?

446
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
I want to start from scratch

447
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,830
and have my own business.

448
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,560
Save it.

449
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,680
You don't have to.

450
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Isn't your dad
the king of stock's value?

451
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
Starting from scratch is his business.

452
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,760
You just have to

453
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,800
inherit his estate.

454
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,830
Listen.

455
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,800
Don't talk nonsense.

456
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,350
I have a hunch that

457
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,040
Zixin in 2022

458
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,110
will be so successful

459
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,310
and busy that

460
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,430
she doesn't even have time to

461
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,000
come back to open the wish bottle.

462
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,350
All thanks to your lucky words.

463
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,680
You are so biased.

464
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,070
You didn't say anything about my future.

465
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,760
Collect them for me.

466
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,560
I will pick up a phone.

467
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,190
Mom.

468
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,920
What's up?

469
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,000
To the hospital?

470
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,680
Why?

471
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,190
It's all your dad's fault.

472
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,110
He wanted to find

473
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,640
the feeling of youth.

474
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,920
So he rides me on his bike
without holding on to the handlebars.

475
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,310
Soon

476
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,520
we hit a tree.

477
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,350
I can't move now.

478
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,680
I have to go to the hospital
for an X-ray.

479
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,280
You sprained the ankle?

480
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,000
What about dad?

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,350
Is he fine?

482
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,560
He's fine.

483
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,800
But his nose hit the tree.

484
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
So he has a nosebleed.

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,920
Don't frighten her.

486
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,640
It's okay.

487
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Qian.

488
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,430
Why are you still having a nosebleed?

489
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,520
Here. Paper for you.

490
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,880
Why again?

491
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,830
Has he had any

492
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,190
headaches or fever lately?

493
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,520
Fever?

494
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,280
Qian, come here.

495
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Let me try.

496
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,640
Kind of.

497
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,680
It's fine.

498
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,400
I feel good.

499
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,680
Maybe it's a seasonal cold.

500
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,520
Well, mom. Listen to me.

501
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,000
When you go to
the orthopedic department to register,

502
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,710
help him register for blood routine

503
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,310
and bone puncture.

504
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,070
I will go back with Qian Chuan

505
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,400
right now.

506
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,230
Wait for me.

507
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,000
Take things back

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,800
for me.

509
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,110
Okay.

510
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,680
I am leaving.

511
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,000
Okay.

512
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,040
What happened to her?

513
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
It seems her parents called to say

514
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,520
they were in the hospital.

515
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,310
(Gate 3, East Campus, Guanghua University)
Don't worry, Qian Wei.

516
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,920
(Gate 3, East Campus, Guanghua University)
You just had a dream.

517
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,040
It won't come true.

518
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,310
You don't understand.

519
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,040
What should happen will happen.

520
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,520
No way.

521
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,800
It's just an accident.

522
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,760
Why don't they stop?

523
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,590
Let me help you.

524
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,190
Why are they leaving?

525
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,350
There is no taxi at all.

526
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,920
No…

527
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,470
Qian Wei.

528
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,830
Where are you going

529
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,920
in such a hurry?

530
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,710
Thank you, Li Chongwen.

531
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,950
It's alright, just go.

532
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,160
Let me handle it.

533
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,400
Okay.

534
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,640
Just go.

537
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,760
Hello.

538
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,640
Why are you running?

539
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,110
I won't do this again.

540
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,760
How come?

541
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,800
You were healthy

542
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,430
half a year ago.

543
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,110
How can you possibly have leukemia?

544
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,230
How come?

545
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,040
It shouldn't be that serious.

546
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,710
Exactly.

547
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,400
Stop crying.

548
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,110
Others may think

549
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,400
you are the one who is sick.

550
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
We must calm down at this moment.

551
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,520
Understand?

552
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,400
I can't make it.

553
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,950
Our dad never

554
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,470
smokes or drinks,

555
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,040
and he goes for a walk
every day after dinner.

556
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,350
It is said that walking after meals

557
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,430
is good for longevity.

558
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,920
There are so many bad people.

559
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,800
Why it's our dad's turn?

560
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,190
Stop talking about this

572
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
at this moment.

573
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
Only early symptoms.

574
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,920
(Diagnosis: Early Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)
Early?

575
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,950
Only early?

576
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,350
It's leukemia any way.

577
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,190
It's all your fault.

578
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,070
Why did you dream

579
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,230
to scare our dad?

580
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,920
I was asked to assemble for training.

581
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,880
Not for now.

582
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,350
I'm going to ask for leave now.

583
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,430
All right.

584
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,880
Stop being like this.

585
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,110
Just go for training.

586
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,310
Dad.

587
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,830
Do you believe me?

588
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,470
Well…

589
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,830
Enough.

590
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,640
It's not a big deal.

591
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,830
Listen.

592
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,070
I never told you that

593
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,430
I had another dream.

594
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,710
I dreamed of your recovery

595
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,590
and witnessed me

596
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,430
becoming a real lawyer.

597
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,590
We accompanied Qian Chuan

598
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,880
to the national team.

599
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,000
Then you and mom

600
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
went on a tour.

601
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,560
Great!

602
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,160
Don't worry. I got it.

603
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,520
We can certainly

604
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,830
get through this.

605
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,560
Stop crying.

606
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,040
Be a man.

607
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,760
Your first priority now

608
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,110
is to be with mom.

609
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,830
Leg injuries also need attention.

610
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,430
Don't make her leave

611
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,520
any aftereffects.

612
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,310
Understand?

613
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,400
Well.

614
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,230
My mom should be on duty today.

615
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,830
She told me that

616
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,640
there might be beds
in the inpatient department.

617
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,110
I will deal with it.

618
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,950
Okay.

619
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,430
Qian Chuan,

620
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,640
how's everything going?

621
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,590
The streetlights down there are broken.

622
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,350
Walk slowly.

623
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,070
How about this, Qian Chuan?

624
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,160
After I get packed,

625
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,470
I'll go back to accompany him.

626
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,680
When he's taking the infusion,

627
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,520
remember

628
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,760
to confiscate the snacks

629
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,520
in his pockets.

630
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,830
He mustn't eat such dry snacks.

631
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,590
Got it?

632
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,190
And remember

633
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,710
to buy a respirator for him.

634
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,880
He's vulnerable now.

635
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,280
He has to wear one in the open air.

636
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,680
And turtle soup, right?

637
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,230
I'll go...

638
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,280
I'll go get

639
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,000
the electric cooker and so forth.

640
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,880
Don't worry, all right?

641
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,760
Wei,

642
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,470
I'll keep it in mind.

643
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,470
I used to think

644
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,350
that you were only
half a minute older than me.

645
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,520
But today, I'm convinced.

646
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,920
You're indeed my elder sister.

647
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,230
We nearly lost our father.

648
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,350
I'm so scared.

649
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,800
Wei,

650
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,160
did you tell the truth?

651
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,040
Did you really dream

652
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,400
that Father will get better?

653
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,920
Rest assured. He'll get better.

654
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,350
Are you all right?

655
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,350
Qian Wei.

656
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,430
Qian Wei, are you all right?

657
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,640
Everything will be all right.

658
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,950
I asked Qian Chuan this afternoon.

659
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,350
I know you're feeling sad.

660
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
But you have us.

661
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,070
Stop crying.

662
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,310
Stop. Stop.

663
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,760
We know you must be too busy

664
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,640
to take care of the school thing.

665
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,680
We... We've packed

666
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,310
your clothes, books, and laptop.

667
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,950
And the torch.

668
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,430
When you go to
or come back from the hospital,

669
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,070
it must be dark at night.

670
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,070
Use the torch then.

671
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,000
If you need anything,

672
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,070
text us.

673
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,560
We'll bring it to you,

674
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,280
all right?

675
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,230
Don't worry, Qian Wei.

676
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,000
From this day on,

677
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,070
I'll take the roll call for you

678
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,470
in all kinds of classes.

679
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:25,920
For you,

680
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,950
I'll study hard

681
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,160
and take notes carefully.

682
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,110
You won't

683
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,760
fall behind in study.

684
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
I also packed some ginseng

685
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,710
from Changbai Mountain.

686
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,310
Let your father eat it

687
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,520
for some nutrition.

688
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,830
A leukemia patient can't eat ginseng.

689
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,950
Or he'll have blood-heat.

690
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,520
Don't... don't let him eat it, then.

691
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,230
It doesn't matter.

692
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,680
I'll eat it.

693
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,070
I'll eat it up.

694
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,590
Qian Wei, don't worry.

695
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,800
My parents know some experts

696
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,070
in hemopathy.

697
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,230
If your father needs them,

698
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,800
I'll contact them immediately.

699
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,400
Okay?

700
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,160
Thank you.

701
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,280
Stop crying.

702
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,350
Everything will be all right.

703
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,700
(Calling from the Matron)

704
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,830
Didn't I ask you not to eat it

705
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,920
when you came for hospitalization?

706
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,400
Why did you still try to eat it?

707
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,710
I'll confiscate the knife.

708
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,280
What happened, Father?

709
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,310
There are you, Qian Wei.

710
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,000
Your father's platelet index is poor.

711
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,070
Even a little cut or scratch

712
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,230
will cause massive blood loss.

713
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,070
But look at him.

714
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,110
As soon as your brother left,

715
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,710
he peeled an apple

716
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,640
on the sly.

717
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,110
I caught him in the act.

718
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,350
I'm no longer bleeding. I'm fine.

719
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,760
Stop complaining to her.

720
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,470
What's wrong with you?

721
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,590
How many times have I told you

722
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,000
not to eat apples for the moment?

723
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,830
What if your intestine
is cut accidentally?

724
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,350
I... I don't mean to eat it.

725
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,800
Every afternoon,

726
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,560
I peel an apple

727
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,640
for your mother.

728
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,950
Don't you know

729
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,160
you're sick?

730
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Even if I'm sick, life still goes on.

731
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,310
I should be still a good husband.

732
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,430
Think about Stephen Hawking.

733
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,400
When he was so badly sick,

734
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,920
he still did scientific inventions.

735
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,950
I'm okay.

736
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,560
Never mind, Uncle Qian.

737
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,640
I've peeled apples for you.

738
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,190
Look.

739
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,310
Good job.

740
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,830
Come on. Whose side are you on?

741
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,760
Don't make an animal for her.

742
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,160
Make her an ice cream

743
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,400
so that she'll cool down.

744
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,760
She's quite bad-tempered.

745
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,830
When you're together,

746
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,710
concede to her.

747
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,640
Or she'll really beat you.

748
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,800
I've been conceding to her.

749
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,430
She just hasn't realized it.

750
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,040
What... what are you talking about?

751
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,350
All right, Mr. Qian.

752
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,950
Just this once.

753
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,280
Don't do it again. Got it?

754
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,640
Lu Xun,

755
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,880
after you peel the apples,

756
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,590
hand in the knife

757
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,350
to me.

758
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,920
Come over, Qian Wei.

759
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,000
Don't be too worried.

760
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,400
Your father thinks positively.

761
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,310
This is good for him.

762
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,590
You know, during the treatment,

763
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,230
not only
the medical service is important,

764
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,400
but the mentality is important too.

765
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,920
When your father thinks positively,

766
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,400
his body will exude

767
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,350
enzymes and hormones

768
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,040
that are good for his health.

769
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,430
It'll be very helpful

770
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,430
to improve his immune system

771
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,920
and organs.

772
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,680
Come on.

773
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,350
He's rather dramatic.

774
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,400
I can't stop worrying about him.

775
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,640
You always worry.

776
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,560
But Lu Xun can help.

777
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,680
Isn't it good

778
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,710
when he takes care of your father?

779
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,160
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

780
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,350
He... He and I are not...

781
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,430
Do we need some basic skills

782
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,920
to peel apples like this?

783
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,950
No matter how I try

784
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,880
to change the destiny,

785
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,310
I can't let it go this way.

786
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,380
(Outpatient)

787
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,760
Hurry.

788
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm not going.

789
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,190
Get up.

790
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,520
I'm not going!

791
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,920
If you still force me,

792
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,430
I'll call the matron.

793
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,920
If you make me bleed,

794
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,830
I'll suffer.

795
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,160
Call the matron, then.

796
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,110
But you have to take the puncture.

797
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,110
Struggling with me

798
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,920
won't do you any good.

799
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,760
When the matron comes

800
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
and gives you a sedative,

801
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,830
you still have to go.

802
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,230
When I had the bone puncture last time,

803
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,430
I felt terrible.

804
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,160
I hear after taking

805
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
the lumbar puncture,

806
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,430
I have to lie flat for six hours
without moving.

807
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,640
The hospital gown

808
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,680
feels bad.

809
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,640
It's rough. It hurts my skin.

810
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,350
How about asking your mother

811
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,560
to bring me

812
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,950
my silk pajamas?

813
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,400
Silk pajamas?

814
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,760
Why don't you ask for pour-over coffee?

815
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,520
Don't be dramatic.

816
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,000
Just get up.

817
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
No, I won't.

818
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,560
Lu Xun.

819
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,110
Lu Xun.

820
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,590
Restrain her, will you?

821
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,470
I... I can't, Uncle Qian.

822
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,230
It's so rude of you.

823
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,680
I can't restrain her
when she's being rude.

824
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,590
I don't dare to.

825
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,950
I'm going to win, Uncle Qian.

826
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,230
Double kill.

827
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,560
Why don't you just kill me?

828
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,070
It feels so good.

829
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,950
What are these?

830
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,070
They're for you, Uncle Qian.

831
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,470
(Adult diapers)

832
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,760
Adult diapers?

833
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,830
You have to lie in bed

834
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,920
for more than six hours

835
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,640
with the infusion.

836
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,470
What if you want to pee?

837
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,040
I...

838
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,640
I don't use diapers.

839
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,920
I thought they were for you.

840
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,190
I wondered why you needed them

841
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,880
(Adult diapers)
when you were so young.

842
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,520
You won't use them?

843
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,000
Then will you pee in bed?

844
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,190
You will use them, Uncle Qian.

845
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,520
I can hold back the urine.

846
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,310
I must defend my dignity.

847
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,590
If my wife knows it,

848
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,400
I'll be ashamed.

849
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,230
According to Qian Wei,

850
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,070
this is what you pay
for your silk pajamas.

851
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm sorry, Uncle Qian,

852
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,880
but you have to wear a diaper.

853
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,710
I can hold back the urine.

854
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,560
You can't.

855
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,950
I once held for 12 hours.

856
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,350
Sorry, but you can't do it this time.

857
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,000
I have to help you wear it.

858
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:42,140
(TCM Rehabilitation Hospital)

859
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,920
Come on.

860
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,040
What are you doing?

861
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,710
Qian Yanping!

862
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,000
Come down!

863
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
What are you doing?

864
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,190
Keep your voice down.

865
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,310
Don't dazzle me.

866
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,430
Come down quickly.

867
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,160
What are you doing?

868
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,430
Today is the wedding anniversary

869
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,590
of your mother and me.

870
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,520
She can't walk for the moment.

871
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
What a perfect chance!

872
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,880
I must do something.

873
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,760
It's our 20th wedding anniversary.
What a rare chance!

874
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,950
Just come down immediately.

875
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,640
Do you want to come down personally

876
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,110
or do you want him to get you down?

877
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,680
Give me a hand.

878
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,520
So, you learned
to climb the wall from him?

879
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,640
Hurry.

880
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,350
Come down.

881
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,520
I won't.

882
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,760
Be careful, Uncle Qian.

883
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,160
Come down.

884
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,640
Stop climbing.

885
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,760
Give me a hand.

886
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,640
No. No way.

887
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,280
Come down.

888
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,110
What are you doing?

889
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,520
Come down, or I'll call the security.

890
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,400
Push... Push me up.

891
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,230
I won't.

892
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,070
Just come down.

893
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,920
Come down.

894
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,470
Be careful.

895
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,430
Let me go home

896
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,070
and meet your mother.

897
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,920
You can't. No way.

898
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,000
I'll be back after dinner.

899
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,040
No way. Come down.

900
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,920
I won't.

901
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,230
Help me to get him down.

902
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,640
He won't.

903
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,230
Get him down.

904
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,640
You...

905
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,760
Time to test your loyalty. Hurry.

906
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,680
Get him down.

907
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,680
Take her away.

908
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,070
Get him down immediately!

909
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,880
Push me up.

910
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,070
What...

911
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,950
Get him down!

912
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,830
Push me up.

913
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,800
Get him down!

914
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,560
Done.

915
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You can have a video chat now.

916
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,640
I can?

917
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,280
Here he is.

918
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,310
Hello, Uncle Qian.

919
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,110
Honey.

920
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,950
Look at them.

921
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,110
Good evening.

922
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,110
Good. Good.

923
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,560
Very clear.

924
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,880
Come on.

925
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,760
Why did you bother Lu Xun

926
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
when it was so late?

927
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
It's just a wedding anniversary.

928
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,230
It's okay if we don't celebrate it.

929
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Never mind.

930
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,070
I'm glad

931
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,040
when you feel happy.

932
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,830
It's getting cold recently.

933
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,000
Every year when it gets cold,

934
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,800
you have a stomach ache

935
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,760
and I make yam porridge for you.

936
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,560
But now, I'm away.

937
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm afraid you can't have a good diet.

938
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,680
Look.

939
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,110
Lu Xun and our daughter
are taking great trouble

940
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,710
to take care of you.

941
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,110
Don't keep them worried,

942
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,110
or they'll lose weight.

943
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,230
My father only

944
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,350
cares about his wife.

945
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,470
He doesn't care about me at all.

946
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,400
Come on.

947
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,470
You never said you wanted some porridge.

948
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,920
She's just asking for trouble.

949
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,230
How are you doing at home?

950
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,230
Take to him, Aunt.

951
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,640
I'll check some texts.

952
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,950
How are you doing at home?

953
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,310
(You accompany me
to the hospital every day,)

954
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,000
(and tonight,
you even brought the laptop)

955
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,040
(for my mother.)

956
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,920
(Thank you.)

957
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,160
You take care of yourself.

958
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,920
(You're welcome.)

959
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,280
Just rest assured.

960
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,800
(I did this so we could)

961
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,400
(discuss the work schedule in the club.)

962
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,950
Enjoy your life.

963
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,080
(I need to pick up my mom
from the night shift,)

964
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,230
(so, I was on my way there anyway.)

965
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,360
You... You sing me a song.

966
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,950
The kids are here.

967
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,420
(Yam porridge)

968
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,520
I just got up a little late,

969
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,320
and why is the line so long already?

970
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,320
How long do I have to wait?

971
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,320
Hello?

972
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,470
(I know you like to get physical,)

973
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,910
(but don't hit yourself.)

974
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,320
(Try to look straight ahead)

975
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,760
Here, here.

976
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,670
Why are you here?

977
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,710
I saw

978
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,040
your Renren post last night,

979
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,800
OK?

980
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,190
You said there would be a queue

981
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,430
for the ultrasound, right?

982
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,150
So, I set my alarm clock for 4:00

983
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,520
and got up to queue for you.

984
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,520
The doctor starts work at 8:00.

985
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,470
In this way, your father

986
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,630
won't have to wait.

987
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,280
Come on.

988
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,710
Young lady.

989
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,630
There's a queue here.

990
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,870
How can you jump the queue?

991
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,560
Sorry, madam.

992
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,320
This is my girlfriend.

993
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,320
No, I'm his aunt.

994
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,910
We are relatives.

995
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,080
Yeah.

996
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,280
Come here.

997
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,870
Stand here.

998
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,630
Just wait here.

999
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,520
I'll wait for you in the back.

1000
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,040
Sorry, madam.

1001
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,800
Sorry.

1002
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,190
Gloves!

1003
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,710
Or your hands will itch
after cutting the yam.

1004
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,910
No time for gloves.

1005
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,630
Boil for half an hour and then

1006
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,910
put rock sugar and wolfberries.

1007
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,190
In all my years at work,

1008
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,040
I haven't had

1009
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,320
my son's homemade breakfast.

1010
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,040
Why don't we all eat

1011
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,910
in the ward later?

1012
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,910
Don't, Mom.

1013
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,390
Please,

1014
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,080
don't scare her, okay?

1015
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,840
When you asked me

1016
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,040
to register for a bed,

1017
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,670
you promised

1018
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,870
to let me see the girl.

1019
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,800
The matron talks about her a lot.

1020
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,710
Why can't you let

1021
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,230
your own mother meet her?

1022
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:20,940
Wait.

1023
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,600
I've checked it for you already.

1024
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,560
You should get married
after graduation in 2015,

1025
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,630
and then have a baby
in the year of the Sheep.

1026
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,670
It's a good match with your animal.

1027
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,560
The Sheep is gentle and attentive.

1028
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,390
And the baby can

1029
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,710
study medicine with me.

1030
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,360
OK, OK.

1031
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,840
You can meet her.

1032
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,430
Can you not

1033
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,080
tell me that now?

1034
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,840
I'm cutting something here,

1035
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,950
what if I cut

1036
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,230
my finger off?

1037
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,230
You didn't even brush
your teeth in the morning

1038
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,910
and you came here to talk to me.

1039
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,230
Go clean up first.

1040
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,120
Go clean up.

1041
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,870
You brat!

1042
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,630
You're just like your father!

1043
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,150
Why can't you be like me?

1044
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,080
Unbelievable.

1045
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:46,870
Are you…?

1046
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,120
Watch your mouth, young man.

1047
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,470
You're not a morning person,

1048
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,430
and that hasn't changed at all.

1049
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,670
Scold me.

1050
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,760
This…

1051
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,230
I think she'll find me

1052
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,320
quite warm.

1053
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,150
Thank you.

1054
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,560
You're welcome.

1055
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,430
You're my aunt now,

1056
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,390
I suppose I should

1057
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,320
queue for you.

1058
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,360
How's your dad doing?

1059
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,470
His condition is basically
under control.

1060
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,870
We're waiting for the chemo to finish

1061
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,040
and then he can have

1062
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,670
a bone marrow transplant.

1063
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,120
Good.

1064
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,150
If you need

1065
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,320
any help later,

1066
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,080
just let me know.

1067
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,430
It's okay,

1068
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,630
I can handle it myself.

1069
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,520
Actually, I'm not
saying this or doing this

1070
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
because you're Qian Wei,

1071
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,040
or because I want something from you,

1072
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,080
but because

1073
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,080
I'm a man

1074
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,280
who lost his father,

1075
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,760
and I don't want this

1076
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,000
to happen to you too.

1077
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,670
This is

1078
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,120
a video of Professor Zhong Xiuyong's

1079
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,280
civil law lecture.

1080
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,150
I see you have been posting

1081
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,560
his views and memes

1082
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
on Renren.

1083
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,280
I was representing the student union

1084
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,910
at the reception,

1085
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,520
so I made a copy.

1086
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,360
Yeah, right.

1087
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,080
I forgot that Professor Zhong

1088
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,600
was coming to our school
to give a lecture.

1089
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,600
But the School doesn't

1090
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,840
allow video recordings, right?

1091
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,190
Isn't this a bad idea?

1092
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,280
This is actually the good news

1093
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,040
I want to tell you.

1094
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,280
You're going to be

1095
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,630
a member of the board soon.

1096
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,560
The teachers just finished their review

1097
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,950
and the public review
will be next month,

1098
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,280
so you're not an outsider.

1099
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,910
Take it.

1100
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,360
Really?

1101
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,120
What?

1102
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,280
You think I'm lying to you?

1103
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,280
Lu Xun.

1104
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,630
This porridge is really good.

1105
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,560
I've always craved it,

1106
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,670
but my dad only made it for my mom.

1107
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,950
When you have a wife…

1108
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,470
Yes, let her cook it for you.

1109
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,600
You cook it for your wife.

1110
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,760
Wei.

1111
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,320
You love yam porridge, right?

1112
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,360
I saved a bowl for you.

1113
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,760
Why are you here?

1114
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,150
Where did you get the porridge?

1115
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,320
Extra food from the hospital cafeteria.

1116
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,950
The matron got it for you.

1117
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,120
Lu Xun was asked to bring it here.

1118
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Right, Lu Xun?

1119
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,150
What are you eating?

1120
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Some porridge.

1121
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,320
My favorite.

1122
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,950
Who gave it to you?

1123
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,190
The matron said it's extra.

1124
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,190
If you're not hungry,

1125
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,870
leave it here

1126
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,710
and eat it later.

1127
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,910
Wei, have the porridge.

1128
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,320
It's still hot. Don't waste it.

1129
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,600
(Lu Xun made this porridge.)

1130
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,390
(It's him all along)

1131
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,730
♪You're the one for the rest of my life♪

1132
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,050
♪Even stars can't be as shiny as you♪

1133
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,170

1134
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,290

♪You're the one for the rest of my life♪
