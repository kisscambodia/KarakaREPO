1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,720
It's mine!

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,750
This is mine!

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,000
He tore my doll.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,400
He should pay me.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,920
We spent one coin each

6
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,960
to catch

7
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,390
this doll.

8
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,520
Why give it to you?

9
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,030
You see.

10
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,640
You catch the doll together,

11
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,390
which means you must be good friends.

12
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,150
You can't break up

13
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,120
just because of a doll.

14
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,200
Is friendship more important

15
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,150
or the doll more important?

16
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,520
- The doll!
- The doll!

17
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,760
You can't reason

18
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,070
with the children.

19
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,920
I just asked that

20
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,440
there are dolls catching machine
in the nearby mall.

21
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,150
We can catch two dolls

22
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,150
for them.

23
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,790
Let's go.

24
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm not good at it. You're good at it.

25
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,310
Hurry up.

26
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,360
I really want you to win once

27
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,110
and show me.

28
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
Avoiding can't solve any problems

29
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,040
but only make us lose more.

30
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,000
All right.

31
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,150
You take care of them for me.

32
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,790
I'll give a doll to you

33
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,880
right away!

34
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,420
(Promulgating the law gives us an explanation
and learning the law gives us strength)

35
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,520
Sit still.

36
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,150
How did this happen?

37
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,120
Who tore that?

38
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,830
Just solve the problem!

39
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,080
Why bother to take her catching a doll?

40
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,460
=Episode 9 Law Eliminates Disputes
Indulges in Kindness and Avoids Evilness=

00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,140
(Chong&Wei Law Firm Qian Wei)

42

=Legally Romance=

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,880
Come on. Have a try.

44
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't catch one

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
even if I try a hundred times.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
But Li Chongwen was good at

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,080
catching dolls last time.

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,000
Sure enough,

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,550
he also wants to

50
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,960
show off his skills this time.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,440
I won't speak out what I know.

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,240
Let him perform

53
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,000
if he wants to.

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,830
I can't do that.

55
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,960
Come on.

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
I have bad luck.

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
It's okay. Have a try.

58
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,440
No. You go ahead.

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,000
OK. I'll do it.

60
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,390
Let me tell you.

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
In fact,

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
this machine has a probability.

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,270
As long as you find the chance,

64
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,550
you can catch it.

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,320
I couldn't afford to play these games

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,270
when I was a child.

67
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
I could only watch them on the side.

68
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,000
After watching long,
I understand how it works.

69
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,190
Come on. I'll catch one for you.

70
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,270
All right.

71
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,670
Wow. You're great.

72
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,360
But the dolls inside

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,600
are really ugly.

74
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,960
Except for that little tiger,

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
it looks better.

76
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,800
By the way,

77
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm curious about something.

78
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,550
You're just a freshman.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,390
How can you understand
so many laws and regulations?

80
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,600
From housing disputes

81
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,910
to private lending,

82
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,190
you know more than

83
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,830
those senior students.

84
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,360
If you have a boss

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,600
who forces you to

86
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,670
read all kinds of laws and contracts,

87
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,240
you can also do it.

88
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,360
Boss?

89
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,360
Who?

90
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,360
Who is your boss?

91
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,110
They're still waiting.

92
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,030
Catch it as soon as possible.

93
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,880
Watch me catch this.

94
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
Here is the peacock.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
If you like playing with this frog,

96
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,110
just take it.

97
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,470
A brother should be humble.

98
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,320
Do you know?

99
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,320
Now do you know

100
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,670
what is the inviolability

101
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,390
of citizens'

102
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,880
legal private property?

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,800
Got it.

104
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
Now that you understand it,

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,360
what should you do?

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,110
Make up.

107
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,800
Make up.

108
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,390
Make up?

109
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,800
How to make up?

110
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,350
Let me see.

111
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,600
That's good.

112
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,000
We're back.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,550
Did you quarrel?

114
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,000
No.

115
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,270
What is this?

116
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,790
You made it up with each other?

117
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,200
Very sensible.

118
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,920
Come.

119
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,270
This is your reward.

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,950
Thank you.

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,350
- Thank you.
- No quarrels in the future.

122
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,550
Let's go.

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,040
You are a great and handsome guy.

124
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,670
How many skills I don't know

125
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,600
do you have?

126
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,790
What do you mean?

127
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,390
Well, I mean

128
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,830
when did you learn paper folding?

129
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,600
What is this?

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Did you see that?

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,440
Children are the same as adults.

132
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,510
What they say

133
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,230
is not necessarily the same
as what they think.

134
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,230
Right?

135
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,160
They care about each other's feelings.

136
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,040
They just need an opportunity
to make it easy.

137
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,640
What are you doing?

138
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,670
None of this is for you.

139
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,200
This is a special one for you.

140
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,950
What is this?

141
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,830
Guess it, Qian Wei.

142
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,040
Don't you know everything?

143
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,230
Such an obvious pig.

144
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,200
Can't you see that?

145
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,070
You're the pig!

146
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,350
Hey.

147
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,270
Have you considered

148
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,510
what I just said to you?

149
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,000
What?

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,270
Children are the same as adults.

151
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,760
What they say is not the same
as what they think.

152
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,110
You didn't even listen.

153
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,320
I won't give it to you.

154
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,160
Do you have this here?

155
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,270
Have you finished sending these?

156
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes.

157
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,110
Classmates.

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,950
You worked hard this morning.

159
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,670
Look what surprise

160
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,720
I brought you.

161
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,270
One for each.

162
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,600
Thank you, senior.

163
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,440
Thank you, senior.

164
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,110
- Here you are.
- Thank you, senior.

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,040
Thank you, senior.

166
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,920
You've had a long day.

167
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,790
Thank you, senior.

168
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,830
Yours.

169
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,640
Thank you, senior.

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Here you are, classmate.

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,110
Thank you, senior.

172
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,230
Pocket Monster.

173
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,880
Thank you, senior.

174
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,950
How cute!

175
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,660
Yours is cute, too.

176
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,880
You liked this one

177
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
in the morning,

178
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,270
right?

179
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,110
Almost every catch can get it.

180
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,440
The hit rate is already very high.

181
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Do you have to be so persistent

182
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
in catching tiger cat?

183
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,200
It is what I want most.

184
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,950
Do you understand?

185
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,880
It looks

186
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,350
like a little tiger

187
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,950
and people dare not approach.

188
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,160
In fact,

189
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,510
it's a delicate kitten inside.

190
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
I didn't realize it could be changed.

191
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,270
Isn't this the same as you?

192
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,720
Senior, are you too biased?

193
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,070
You gave ugly dolls to us like

194
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,000
frogs and mice.

195
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,790
Why did you give Qian Wei

196
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,830
a lovely cat?

197
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,270
- Yeah. What's this?
- Yeah.

198
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,790
It's all because of luck.

199
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,440
I can't catch

200
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,640
all the same ones, right?

201
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,440
By the way,

202
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,830
this is for you.

203
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,160
Here you are.

204
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,040
This tastes good.

205
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,670
Senior, how do you know that

206
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,760
I like this taste.

207
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,480
It's delicious!

208
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,230
This is simply…

209
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,440
You know me too well!

210
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,390
How did you know that?

211
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,640
Qian Wei didn't eat just now.

212
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,950
She accompanied me to catch the dolls.

213
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,670
That's why I buy her a cup of milk tea.

214
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,670
If I knew you liked it,

215
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,640
I'd bring you one, too.

216
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,350
No problem.

217
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,320
That's enough.

218
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,600
After all, she can't eat

219
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,350
something too sweet.

220
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,320
I can drink it for her.

221
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,760
This milk tea is particularly delicious.

222
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,280
I suggest you taste it, too.

223
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,550
I strongly recommend it.

224
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,440
Look at senior.

225
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,080
Here comes another

226
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,230
strange pair.

227
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,960
Sure.

228
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,150
Fate is wonderful.

229
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,710
Well.

230
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Lunch break is almost over.

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,840
Let's go.

232
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,880
- The resident should be here later.
- Let's go.

233
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,910
OK.

234
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,130
Put the garbage away.

235
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,960
Good-tasting.

236
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,590
Right?

237
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,520
I'll buy you one next time, too.

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,590
I'll buy you one more, too.

239
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,520
I'll give you a strawberry flavor.

240
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,150
How about it?

241
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,670
It's sweeter.

242
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,880
This is what I like.

243
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,840
You like the taste, too?

244
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,000
Lady.

245
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,550
Lady.

246
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
You have to help me!

247
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,520
You help me!

248
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,110
Grandma, don't worry.

249
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,710
You sit down and talk to me slowly.

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,030
You see.

251
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,230
The money I put in here

252
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,590
is all gone!

253
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,350
I saved my pension

254
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,110
for several years.

255
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,110
Grandma, don't worry.

256
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,640
Why don't we call the police for you?

257
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,280
Has anyone else

258
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,400
been in your house recently?

259
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,620
(Mobile phone money
saved for grandchild)

260
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,670
Yes.

261
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,710
Li next door.

262
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,200
He helped me

263
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,710
fix the water pipe at home yesterday.

264
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,670
He stayed in my house for a long time.

265
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,960
It's him.

266
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,590
Grandma?

267
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,110
What are you doing here

268
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,230
instead of staying at home?

269
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,030
- Let's go. I'll take you home.
- Shen.

270
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,840
Shen.

271
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,080
I lost so much money.

272
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,150
I have to call the police.

273
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,030
I can't go back.

274
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,470
- Let's go. I'll take you home.
- I can't go back.

275
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,710
I can't go back.

276
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,790
Aunt.

277
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,960
Here's 30,000 yuan

278
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,590
from your grandson's bag.

279
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,000
Since the amount
of theft is relatively large,

280
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,110
we'll take him back to the Bureau.

281
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,110
Impossible!

282
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,670
Policemen.

283
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,910
Is there

284
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,110
something wrong?

285
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,550
My grandson is very well-behaved.

286
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,280
He can't do such a thing.

287
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm sorry.

288
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,960
I know it will make you sad,

289
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,640
but we must do it.

290
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,760
I remember it.

291
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,320
This 30,000 yuan

292
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,150
is the pocket money I gave him.

293
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,030
Policemen.

294
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,520
I'm old and confused.

295
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,030
You see.

296
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,280
If you want to catch someone, catch me.

297
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,400
Come and catch me.

298
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,110
Aunt.

299
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,280
Grandma, don't worry.

300
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,200
They just take Shen

301
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,030
to take a note.

302
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,910
He'll be back soon.

303
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,350
Right. Right. Right.

304
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,150
Take a note.

305
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,230
No way.

306
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,880
No one

307
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,030
dares to

308
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,200
take my grandson away today!

309
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,350
He lost his father

310
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,670
and mother since childhood.

311
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,520
He hasn't had a good day

312
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,030
with me, an old bone.

313
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,520
I didn't teach him well.

314
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
I made him be like this.

315
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,280
- Grandma, don't…
- Aunt.

316
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,400
Grandma.

317
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,880
Help her up.

318
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,080
I made him be like this.

319
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,880
Get up. Get up.

320
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,960
Aunt. Aunt.

321
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,520
Get up.

322
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,760
Aunt, please get up.

323
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,080
He'll be back in a minute.

324
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,460
(School fee saved for grandchild)
(Mobile phone money saved for grandchild)

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,640
What's up?

326
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,790
You find a way

327
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,910
to put his grandmother away.

328
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,670
I'll fix it.

329
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
You'll know in a minute.

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,710
Hurry up.

331
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,710
Let's go. I'll take you home.

332
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,230
I'll take you home.

333
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,670
I'll take you home.

334
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,590
You are really…

335
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,000
Your grandmother is so old.

336
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,350
It's not good for her to pull like that.

337
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,840
If you have something to say,
say it nicely.

338
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,200
What do I want to say?

339
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
Just let her go home with me.

340
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,150
Grandma.

341
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,880
How about this?

342
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,350
You can come to me later

343
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,080
and sort things out

344
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,550
from beginning to end.

345
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,760
I'll help you solve it,

346
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,150
okay?

347
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,200
OK. I'll go.

348
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Classmate.

349
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,910
Your grandmother is

350
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,080
asking for our help here.

351
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,470
We can't ignore anything.

352
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,640
You sit here.

353
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,590
Grandma, you sit here.

354
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,200
Where's the money?

355
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,840
What else are you doing
to promulgate the law?

356
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,230
You can't even catch a thief.

357
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,880
What are you doing here?

358
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,440
What?

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,230
You just lost your money
for two seconds.

360
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,280
You are in such a hurry.

361
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,000
Have you ever thought about

362
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,910
how worried is your grandmother?

363
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,230
Well done.

364
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,910
Promulgating law, right?

365
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,030
I think you are

366
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,910
theft and liars.

367
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,230
I'll call the police in a minute

368
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,230
and catch you all!

369
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,790
OK, you call the police now.

370
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,550
When the police comes,

371
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,760
who do you think the police will catch?

372
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,110
That money is mine!

373
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Yours?

374
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,320
Let me tell you.

375
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,350
The amount of your money

376
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,400
has exceeded 30,000.

377
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
According to the provisions

378
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,110
of the criminal law on theft,

379
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
even if your grandmother
doesn't pursue you,

380
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,520
but the police verify it,

381
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
you can still be sentenced.

382
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,150
I know you don't want to

383
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,200
make your grandmother sad.

384
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,350
See.

385
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,110
It's not easy for

386
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,790
your grandmother saving this money.

387
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,640
Do you bear?

388
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,740
(Mobile phone money
saved for grandchild)

389
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,940
(Bicycle money saved for grandchild)

390
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,790
We have another option

391
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,150
besides handing you over to the police.

392
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,350
You go with me now

393
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,550
writing a guarantee.

394
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,520
Write down

395
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,150
your own crime

396
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,000
and promise

397
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,110
(Bicycle money saved for grandchild)
that you will never commit it again in the future,

398
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,910
(Cotton-padded jacket money saved for grandchild)
and I'll wipe out

399
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,840
(Cotton-padded jacket money saved for grandchild)
today's affair.

400
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,840
Otherwise,

401
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,110
let's go to
the public security bureau now.

402
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,550
OK.

403
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,670
Sister.

404
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,640
How much money can you make

405
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,000
from this job?

406
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
This is a public welfare activity.

407
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,280
In other words,

408
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,760
it does no good for you

409
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,080
to catch me, right?

410
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,230
How about this?

411
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,640
I'll give you two thousand yuan.

412
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,030
You just pretend not to see anything.

413
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,080
Let's break up peacefully.

414
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,150
Still playing tricks
with me here, right?

415
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,670
I'll send you to the police today!

416
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,670
No. No. No.

417
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,710
I'll write it. I'll write it.

418
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,150
I'll write it.

419
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,030
Don't play any tricks.

420
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,320
Write the guarantee quickly,

421
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,960
give the money back to your grandma

422
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,280
and apologize to her.

423
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,320
It's not easy for your grandma
to raise you.

424
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,230
I'll keep this guarantee.

425
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,880
If you dare to do it again
in the future,

426
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,280
I'll send you in myself.

427
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,000
You hear me?

428
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,510
(Letter of Guarantee Dear sister:
I'm sorry, because of my momentary greed,)

429
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,820
(I stole grandma's money.
Now I know this behavior is immoral.)

430
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,760
(Shen Tao)

431
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,520
Can I have the money back?

432
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,320
Give it back.

433
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,470
It feels distressed

434
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,150
like I lost

435
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,200
two thousand yuan.

436
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,590
Grandma, we found the money.

437
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,590
Let's go home.

438
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,230
Okay. Okay.

439
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,640
Here you are.

440
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,470
That's nice. That's nice.

441
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,350
Let's go home. Let's go home.

442
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,640
If so,

443
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,350
my daughter's affair

444
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,350
can be solved.

445
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,280
That would be great.

446
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,230
I'll leave first.

447
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,910
- OK.
- OK.

448
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,790
Take a break first.

449
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,150
Here you are.

450
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,030
What is that look?

451
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,440
Eat it or not?

452
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,150
If you don't eat, give it to me.

453
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,790
What do you want?

454
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,910
Strange.

455
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,200
Originally, I thought

456
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,470
you were just solid in theory,

457
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,230
but I didn't expect you
to have a good way

458
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,080
to mediate.

459
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,470
What?

460
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,200
Envy me for my rich source of cases?

461
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,200
Yes.

462
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
If all the lawyers

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,030
were like you,

464
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,910
they would receive a lot of cases.

465
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,320
(We are taking actions)
But the lawyers' fees

466
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,440
(in promulgating and learning the law)
will drop sharply.

467
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,470
Don't you like money best?

468
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,000
How did you learn it

469
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,110
in legal history class?

470
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,000
The law eliminates disputes.

471
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,790
Civil disputes, right?

472
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,200
That's not the art of law.

473
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,760
That is also the art of mediation.

474
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,790
For mediation,

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,840
you can't bring people

476
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
extra trouble

477
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,350
for the sake of

478
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,710
more lawyers' fees.

479
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Sometimes,

480
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,200
litigation is really not

481
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,960
the only choice,

482
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
not even the best choice.

483
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,840
The truth is true.

484
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,080
But it's strange

485
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,910
that such words

486
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,080
come out of your mouth.

487
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,950
Very strange.

488
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,000
Why do you study the law?

489
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,710
By drawing lots.

490
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,350
When I was at school,

491
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,430
my parents quarreled

492
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,830
because I had to apply for a major.

493
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,070
My mother

494
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,160
wanted me

495
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,070
to be a doctor like her.

496
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:22,800
My father

497
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,640
wanted me

498
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,710
to be a judge like him.

499
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,950
(We are taking actions)
There were quarrels all the time.

500
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,950
(in promulgating and learning the law)
They couldn't make up their minds.

501
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,920
We could only draw lots.

502
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,430
Then I chose to major in Law.

503
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,430
Therefore,

504
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,470
I don't think

505
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,830
being a judge is just me talking.

506
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,760
In fact, it has been decided long ago.

507
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,830
So Lu Xun

508
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,950
inherits his father's career as a judge.

509
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,520
Then what changed him

510
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,190
and

511
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,190
made him a lawyer?

512
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,160
What about you?

513
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,280
Do you have anything

514
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,190
you want to do?

515
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,680
No.

516
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,310
When I went to school,

517
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,470
I just wanted to do everything

518
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,800
seriously.

519
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,070
But I didn't know

520
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,310
how dreams feel

521
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,070
to me.

522
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,880
So actually, I envy you.

523
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,830
You have a passion

524
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,880
and a

525
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,560
sense of justice.

526
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,830
I think you will be

527
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,000
a good lawyer.

528
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,340
(Zhanying Law Firm)

529
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,280
(Zhanying Law Firm)
(Judicial examination)

530
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,760
(Zhanying Law Firm)
(is the basic threshold for entry.)

531
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,000
(We don't need)

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,430
(people who can't even
step over the threshold.)

533
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,760
Check in at eight tomorrow morning

534
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,800
with the signed contract.

535
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,830
(Labor Contract)
Your position is my assistant.

536
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,640
I read your resume.

537
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,830
Although Chong&Wei Law Firm

538
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,880
has closed down,

539
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,950
several cases

540
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,310
were beautifully done by them.

541
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,760
It must have something

542
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,830
to do with you.

543
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,760
Capable person

544
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,000
shouldn't be tripped over
by the threshold.

545
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,710
I believe

546
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,400
you will be a good lawyer

547
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,230
in the future.

548
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,830
Really?

549
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,430
See you tomorrow.

550
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,160
Thank you, Lawyer Lu.

551
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
I will work hard.

552
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,160
Unexpectedly,

553
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,920
Lu Xun was the first person
to believe in my ability

554
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,310
even at that time and now.

555
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,350
You have a good taste.

556
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,000
Now the great lawyer in the future

557
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,800
has to work hard.

558
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,350
Come on.

559
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,640
All right.

560
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,310
Then I have to work hard, too.

561
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,000
I asked that

562
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,470
the students would come out in batches.

563
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,880
That girl would be in the last batch.

564
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
When she comes out later,

565
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,520
if there's someone nearby,

566
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,880
you two just go up and hold them.

567
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,280
If there's no one, just do it.

568
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,710
Big brother.

569
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,710
We just want a piece of paper.

570
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,590
Is it worthwhile?

571
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,830
What's on your mind?

572
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,160
If I can't get that piece of paper back,

573
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,190
your brother would be caught
by the police.

574
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,640
Do you want someone to cover you?

575
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,430
Big brother.

576
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,950
Let's show her our strength.

577
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,950
So you're a hooligan.

578
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,470
We should have called the police

579
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,280
and send you in.

580
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,880
You're with them, aren't you?

581
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,520
How dare you come here?

582
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,590
You're bored of living.

583
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,400
Bored of living?

584
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,640
As social scum

585
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
as you,

586
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,680
you won't regret anything.

587
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,950
I really have to show your grandma

588
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,310
what the virtue

589
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,950
of her baby grandson is.

590
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,710
Like to be nosy, don't you?

591
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,110
I will…

592
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,040
I will take your arm off

593
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,110
and make it as clothes hanger.

594
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,800
Do you know what it is?

595
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
This is proof of your ignorance.

596
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,560
In a legal sense,

597
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,830
this is evidence of my self-defense,

598
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,710
What?

599
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,800
Well, I mean…

600
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,400
Now it's my turn!

601
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,190
Big brother.

602
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,230
What are you waiting for?

603
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,190
I didn't expect

604
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,310
such a polite and modest gentleman

605
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,280
in school

606
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,680
to have such a side.

607
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,920
What are you doing here?

608
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,680
What are you doing?

609
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,590
Come down and help!

610
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,190
He has helper.

611
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,950
Fight with me.

612
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,070
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

613
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,560
I'm not interested in fighting violence
with violence.

614
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,280
I am just passing by.

615
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,310
Solve your own private affairs

616
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,310
yourselves.

617
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,880
Beat him!

618
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
Hit the below one.

619
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:03,950
Left.

620
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,280
Right.

621
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,520
Be careful of your back.

622
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,310
It hurts!

623
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,470
Senior.

624
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,160
You can do that.

625
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,880
Hold on a little longer.

626
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,880
You can keep your mouth shut!

627
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,590
Look out.

628
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,800
You beat harder! Pull away.

629
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,350
Here comes the police.

630
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,160
Who called the police?

631
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,190
Stop! Don't move.

632
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,760
I did.

633
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,950
And I'm a witness.

634
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,280
Get down.

635
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,000
Get down.

636
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,040
So weak to fight.

637
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,560
You can keep your mouth shut.

638
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,160
You are strong

639
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,710
GO.

640
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,780
(Public Security)

641
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,280
Thank you, policemen.

642
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,830
Finished recording?

643
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,800
They

644
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,560
are identified crime of picking quarrels
and provoking troubles

645
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
I also…

646
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,920
What are you doing?

647
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,760
I also reported

648
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,470
Shen's larceny.

649
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,190
It may take a while.

650
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,350
I bought you some medicine.

651
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,640
I don't know which one is proper.

652
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,470
Choose it by yourself.

653
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,760
Did you

654
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,920
in case

655
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
Shen may take revenge on Qian Wei?

656
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,000
I knew it.

657
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Well,

658
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,430
the milk tea wasn't wasted.

659
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,310
Thanks.

660
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,760
You're taking advantage of

661
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,520
legitimate loopholes.

662
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,310
Qian Wei won't appreciate

663
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,430
this kind of protection.

664
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,160
It's enough as you appreciate.

665
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,830
Senior.

666
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:23,710
OK, OK.

667
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,560
I know what you want to say.

668
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,470
Meeting violence by violence

669
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,160
is not

670
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,950
the best way,

671
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,000
but it's enough for me.

672
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,560
Qian Wei is innocent and kind.

673
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,280
In her

674
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,160
point of view,

675
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,230
justice can defeat everything.

676
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,000
But the villains won't stop doing evil

677
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,430
due to your kindness.

678
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,640
Only punishment can stop them.

679
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,310
This is the point of law.

680
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,920
Yes, yes, yes.

681
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,590
I get it.

682
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,000
I know that sometimes

683
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,520
we need the special measures

684
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,950
to protect people.

685
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,190
But according to Kant,

686
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,760
The moral rules of human society

687
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,830
need to be examined.

688
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,160
If everyone

689
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,830
insists on violence,

690
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,280
The most violent

691
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,400
individual will become

692
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,640
justice itself.

693
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,830
We study law

694
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,950
to become the constructor

695
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,070
instead of destroyer of law,

696
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,520
right?

697
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
But sometimes,

698
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,110
construction is

699
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,560
based on destruction.

700
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,280
Who said that

701
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,710
only destruction brings construction?

702
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,590
We can also construct

703
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,920
on an empty space.

704
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,520
Give me a piece of white paper…

705
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,400
Enough. Let's go.

706
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:16,880
Let's go.

707
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,710
OK.

708
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,190
Bye-bye.

709
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,350
Where's Lu Xun?

710
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,350
He hasn't finished the documents.

711
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,280
He's gone after

712
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,680
Chongwen left.

713
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,310
You two…

714
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,350
What's wrong with your arm?

715
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,000
Well,

716
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,280
There's a case of neighborhood dispute.

717
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,800
We are inquired to

718
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,880
make a field visit.

719
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,000
Senior was in a hurry

720
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,950
and fell from the motorcycle.

721
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,040
Yes.

722
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,230
I fell accidentally.

723
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,800
It's OK.

724
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,230
Chongwen.

725
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,680
Come here.

726
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,000
I have something to tell you.

727
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,230
There's a deep cooperation

728
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,040
between

729
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
AES and our university.

730
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,830
So, the first demonstration students

731
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,070
of Qingyun Project

732
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,230
are especially important.

733
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,070
I've applied for you.

734
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,110
Qingyun Project is held by

735
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,430
AES.

736
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,520
Chongwen,

737
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,680
among all the students,

738
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,640
I appreciate you the most.

739
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,800
So, I want you to work as an intern

740
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,110
in legal assistance foundation

741
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,470
set by Qingyun.

742
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,070
Well…

743
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,160
On the one hand,
the project is proceeding fast,

744
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,400
I need an assistant.

745
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,110
On the other hand,

746
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,680
the most importantly, I want you to

747
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,830
get more working experiences.

748
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,950
What's more,

749
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,590
the scholarship will be

750
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,430
more favorable.

751
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,430
Well, Professor Wang,

752
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,160
I haven't been graduated.

753
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,920
For the project
with large amount of working capital

754
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
like the foundation,

755
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,110
I'm not experienced in it.

756
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,830
What are you worried about?

757
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,230
Everyone starts from scratch.

758
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,430
I'm confident in you.

759
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,310
Listen,

760
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,680
AES is willing to help the young lawyers

761
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,950
to establish careers.

762
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,430
If you stand out

763
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,560
and let them notice you,

764
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,280
your life will be different,

765
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,070
you know?

766
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,950
I'm the person with experiences.

767
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,110
Listen,

768
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,880
There're only a few chances

769
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,350
in a person's life to succeed.

770
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,640
Think about it.

771
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Seize it.

772
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,640
Don't be regret.

773
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,680
OK.

774
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,800
I'll take the chance.

775
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,350
Think about it.

776
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
AES.

777
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,310
What is AES?

778
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,430
It's a quite famous

779
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,880
leading company

780
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,110
with rich capital and seniority.

781
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,880
Such a good company

782
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,280
cooperate with our university.

783
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,470
Is it making charity?

784
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,070
Maybe they're thinking about

785
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,230
the long-term development

786
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,160
and wants to build a good fame.

787
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,110
Is there a written contract

788
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,640
or agreement

789
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,880
about the project?

790
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,470
Professor Wang didn't mention that.

791
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,070
I'll ask him later.

792
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,760
You should always be careful.

793
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,310
You have to analyze
whether it's sugar or poison

794
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,430
inside the cakes people give you.

795
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,400
Are you worrying about me?

796
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,640
No, no.

797
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,160
Qian Wei.

798
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,760
Why is there a paragraph

799
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,560
missing in your record?

800
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,190
Take a look.

801
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,950
And the

802
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,520
Article 129…

803
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,520
What are you doing?

804
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,230
Why do you peep at my stuff?

805
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,230
I've finished cleaning.

806
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Do you need help?

807
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,110
Yes.

808
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,000
Come here.

809
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,640
Everybody comes here.

810
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,430
Come on.

811
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,000
Look who's here.

812
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,760
Your teacher's wife.

813
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,520
My wife.

814
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Mrs. Yuan Qiao.

815
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,680
She is also the teacher

816
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,710
of students' affairs office.

817
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,070
She knows you've worked hard

818
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,760
and brought you some cakes.

819
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,470
Come. Chongwen, come to help.

820
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,110
Come on.

821
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,040
Coming.

822
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,430
Thank you.

823
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,310
Thank you, Mrs.

824
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,000
Come on, try it.

825
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,710
Thank you, Mrs.

826
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,470
Thank you, Professor Wang.

827
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,280
I want this.

828
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,230
You've working hard.

829
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,350
Take your time.

830
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,000
- I've made a lot.
- Thank you.

831
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,710
It's for everyone.

832
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,400
Thank you, Mrs.

833
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,160
Thank you, Professor Wang.

834
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,800
Thank you, Professor.

835
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,190
Thank you.

836
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,230
It looks delicious.

837
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,070
You're worked hard today.

838
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,640
Come back to rest

839
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,680
after eating the cakes.

840
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,760
You have to continue the work tomorrow.

841
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,600
OK.

842
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,190
Thank you, Professor Wang.

843
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,710
Bye-bye, Mrs.

844
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,800
It's for everyone.

845
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Come, Chongwen.

846
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,760
Come on.

847
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,190
Thank you, Professor Wang.

848
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,310
Thank you, Professor Wang.

849
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,560
Come on.

850
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,800
Thank you, Professor Wang.

851
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,040
Sorry, Mrs..

852
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,880
Try it. Try it.

853
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,230
Take your time.

854
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,520
Come.

855
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,680
It's OK.

856
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,280
I know you've worked hard today.

857
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,040
It's late now.

858
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,920
After eating it.

859
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,950
Come back to take a rest.

860
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,640
OK.

861
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,040
So delicious.

862
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,680
It's none of your business.

863
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,280
You don't know

864
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,470
how complicated it is.

865
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,710
As for Professor Wang Ruogu's
divorce case,

866
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,760
do you know all the time

867
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
that Mrs. Yuan has been suffering
domestic violence?

868
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,430
We've won the case.

869
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,000
They're divorced.

870
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
And I've helped my litigant

871
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,560
win the custody of their child.

872
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,110
We don't have to concern

873
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,230
about the other businesses.

874
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,350
If I didn't

875
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,470
visit Mrs. Yuan,

876
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,830
and found out
that she's been suffering domestic violence

877
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,110
and that her schizophrenia was caused

878
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,680
by the domestic violence,

879
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,920
when would you tell me?

880
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,160
When we providing

881
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,470
legal suggestions,

882
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,710
we concentrated on

883
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,710
her psychological state all the time.

884
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,230
But this is caused

885
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,920
by our litigant.

886
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,470
Could you please calm down?

887
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,160
We lawyers are passive.

888
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,710
We can't

889
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,920
choose the litigant by ourselves.

890
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,760
Yes, but I've said that

891
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,800
I wanted to help the weak.

892
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,830
Helping the litigant

893
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,560
to bully the opposite

894
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
is against my original intention.

895
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,110
I can't let my life

896
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,230
be stained.

897
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,400
Could you please listen to me?

898
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,280
Indeed.

899
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,280
I know this is immoral.

900
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,280
But thanks to Professor Wang,

901
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,800
I own my life today.

902
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,160
Without him

903
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,070
who asked me

904
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,520
to join in Qingyun Project,

905
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,950
could I graduate successfully?

906
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,590
And this law firm was built

907
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,350
with his support.

908
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,920
Besides, there's no record

909
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,800
nor injury identification

910
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,470
about Mrs. Yuan's domestic violence.

911
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,710
Without evidence,

912
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,470
we can't win the case.

913
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,800
Do you remember that?

914
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,710
Also here,

915
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,350
when the law firm was just open,

916
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,280
You said you wanted to

917
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,640
be a good lawyer,

918
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,920
to help the weak,

919
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,710
and eradicate the injustice.

920
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,560
How much do you remember now?

921
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,830
It's hard to meet the opposite interests

922
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,280
and conform to opposite sides.

923
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,040
A good strategy

924
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,880
can help your litigant

925
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
but also hurt the opposite.

926
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,400
There's no way
to make the best of both worlds.

927
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,280
Our lawyers' work

928
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,400
is to protect the litigants' interest

929
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,070
as much as we can.

930
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,470
This is our profession.

931
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:51,920
Do you understand?

932
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,760
Yes.

933
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,880
You ensured your profession.

934
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,400
How about your morality?

935
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,560
You're only

936
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,710
finding excuses

937
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,920
for yourself.

938
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
It's right that

939
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,400
we have to help the side

940
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,350
we choose.

941
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,710
But the problem is that

942
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,310
you made the choice at the beginning.

943
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,380
(Business Records)

944
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,180
(Labor Contract)

945
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,220
(Labor Contract)

946
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,340
(Party A (employer): AES Group)
(Party B (employee): Li Chongwen)

947
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,560
Are you going to leave the lawyer firm

948
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,590
to be the Legal Personnel of AES?

949
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,190
I was about to

950
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,520
take a chance

951
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,280
to tell you.

952
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,470
Also introduced by

953
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,280
Professor Wang?

954
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,800
How ridiculous I am to

955
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,000
talk about morality with you.

956
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,000
You've changed your dream.

957
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,430
I haven't.

958
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,830
You're my dream all the time.

959
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,310
You're enthusiastic

960
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,680
and innocent.

961
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,110
If you continue to be like this,

962
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,800
you'll be hurt

963
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,070
by the reality so badly.

964
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,950
All the efforts I made

965
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,920
are because of you.

966
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,310
Do you understand?

967
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,830
Even if I'm hurt so badly,

968
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,230
I have a clear conscience.

969
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,350
How about you?

970
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,820
(Qian Wei)

971
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,020
(Chong&Wei Law Firm, Qian Wei)

972
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,340
(Labor Contract)

973
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,350
Let's go.

974
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,280
Thank you, Professor Wang.

975
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,920
Let's go.

976
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,040
Professor Wang is so nice.

977
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,950
I wish my boyfriend in the future

978
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,350
can be so considerable.

979
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Excuse me, Professor Wang.

980
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,870
Could you please

981
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,080
check the record for me?

982
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,840
I'll wait for you outside the gate.

983
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,950
OK.

984
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,710
Professor Wang.

985
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,840
The roads are complicated,

986
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,560
and are unfamiliar to Mrs.

987
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,120
Let me see her off.

988
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,670
OK. OK.

989
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,280
Hurry up.

990
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,120
Mind your business first.

991
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,470
OK.

992
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,360
Go, go.

993
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,600
Thank you, Professor Wang.

994
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,760
Let me take them, Mrs.

995
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,840
It's OK, I can handle them.

996
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,280
Mrs., your hands are hurt.

997
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,670
I was knocked

998
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,760
when I made cakes by accident.

999
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,950
Eat the fruit.

1000
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,800
Eat it.

1001
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,280
Eat, it's fresh.

1002
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,520
Eat it.

1003
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,390
Could you just stop it?

1004
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,670
Ziqi is little,

1005
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,040
and so lovely.

1006
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,950
Why did you do that?

1007
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,870
You made everyone

1008
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,760
so painful, you know?

1009
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,470
Don't you know how much I love you?

1010
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,950
Let's divorce.

1011
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,390
Divorce?

1012
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,190
Why divorce?

1013
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,080
I've worked so hard for our family.

1014
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,040
You don't have a job.

1015
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,390
Why do you want to divorce?

1016
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,630
Why?

1017
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,600
Mrs.

1018
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,080
You are hurt badly.

1019
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,390
Let's go to examine it.

1020
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,150
Never mind.

1021
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,230
Don't' make a fuss.

1022
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,760
(There're only a few chances)

1023
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,080
(in a person's life to succeed.)

1024
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,760
Think about it.

1025
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,710
Seize it.

1026
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,760
Don't be regretful.

1027
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,760
The lawyers settle the disputes,

1028
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,040
encourage kindness
and distance the crimes.

1029
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,120
If you're

1030
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,150
puzzled one day,

1031
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,670
think about this sentence.

1032
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,190
Don't take so-called morality

1033
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,760
and procedural justice as excuses

1034
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,080
for yourself to hurt others.

1035
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,150
Mrs. Yuan,

1036
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,800
I know we're the outsider,

1037
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,390
and are not proper to something.

1038
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,190
But for your goodness,

1039
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,630
I want to remind you.

1040
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,630
If you're hurt again next time,

1041
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,470
call the police

1042
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,670
and examine the injuries.

1043
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,470
Keep the evidence.

1044
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,470
Violence is violence.

1045
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,910
Don't trust

1046
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,950
the lie of love.

1047
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,360
If you don't

1048
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
take actions now,

1049
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,000
when you can't stand it,

1050
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,950
you are left with nothing.

1051
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,230
Mrs. Yuan.

1052
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,950
You know our phone number.

1053
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,670
If one day

1054
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,230
something unexpected happened,

1055
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,870
or you want to

1056
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,470
make some changes,

1057
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,760
Please contact us.

1058
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
We'll help you.

1059
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,040
Thank you.

1060
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,670
If these words were heard

1061
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,390
by Professor Wang,

1062
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,120
you'll lose the scholarship

1063
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,910
of Qingyun Project.

1064
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,080
Just now,

1065
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,040
it came across me

1066
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,150
a sentence you said,

1067
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,000
lawyers encourage kindness
and distance the crimes.

1068
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,360
We're like the weather conditions

1069
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,280
to inform those

1070
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,150
who don't know the danger is approaching

1071
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,840
to take umbrellas.

1072
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,840
I was hesitant just now.

1073
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,320
It's their domestic affair.

1074
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,320
I don't know whether I should interfere.

1075
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,560
But when I saw

1076
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,360
your worrying facial expression

1077
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,230
which is like

1078
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,670
the prediction of

1079
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,870
dark clouds in my mind.

1080
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,150
Qian Wei,

1081
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,080
remember that,

1082
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,390
I won't be the person

1083
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,560
you said.

1084
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,670
Good.

1085
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,080
My foresee didn't come true.

1086
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,870
I hope you'll never be

1087
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,800
that kind of person.

1088
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,600
Super Mary

1089
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,520
is holding mushrooms

1090
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,630
fighting with monsters

1091
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,840
and grows stronger.

1092
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,280
but it gradually forgets

1093
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,560
that the goal of the journey

1094
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,360
is to rescue the princess.

1095
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,320
Well,

1096
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,280
are you the princess?

1097
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,630
I'm princess' dad.

1098
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,150
OK.

1099
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,600
Princess' dad.

1100
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,840
What did Mrs. Yuan say to you?

1101
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,190
Do you know that the person
suffering from domestic violence

1102
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,910
wears long sleeves even in summer?

1103
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,560
I saw the injuries in

1104
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,600
Mrs. Yuan's hands.

1105
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,560
My dad

1106
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,710
knows many

1107
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,560
good lawyers.

1108
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,150
They can help.

1109
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,520
According to the present situation,

1110
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
if the litigant doesn't claim,

1111
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,470
we can't interfere.

1112
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,630
But I reminded her

1113
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,320
to protect the evidence.

1114
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,560
If one day,

1115
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,190
they have to confront,

1116
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,430
she can provide the strong evidence

1117
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,390
to protect herself.

1118
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,040
But I'm planning

1119
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,840
to write a paper

1120
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,950
on it.

1121
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,910
Let's bet on

1122
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,320
who will publish a paper

1123
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,230
on Legal Study.

1124
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
So naive.

1125
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,800
I have a question for you.

1126
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,670
You said you wanted to

1127
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,190
be a judge.

1128
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,840
How would you judge

1129
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,710
in this case?

1130
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,950
All the evidence prove

1131
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,600
that the party is with tendency

1132
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,150
of domestic violence.

1133
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,150
But he has prepared

1134
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,870
all the

1135
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,870
evidence

1136
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,630
against the victim.

1137
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,840
How would you judge?

1138
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,520
I can only conform to

1139
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,800
the judicial procedure.

1140
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,430
Both parties have the right to

1141
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,230
defend themselves.

1142
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,800
Of course, I'm sorry

1143
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,950
that I can only judge

1144
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,760
according to the facts and evidence

1145
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,000
they provided

1146
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,950
and their debate.

1147
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,840
But you know,

1149
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,470
many people can't

and rules are overthrown,

1158
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,470
law will be

1159
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,430
