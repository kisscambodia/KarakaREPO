6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,680
I don't allow anyone

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,390
to leave the karaoke room sober.

8

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,190
Cheers.

10
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,520
Come on.

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,000
Friends,

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,470
my wife is expecting our second child.

13
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,600
I'll go home to keep her accompany.

14
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,230
You have fun.

15
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,680
I'll leave first.

(Happy family)

17
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,600
You see your wife and child every day.

18
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,390
But it's not easy for us

19
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,520
to meet as old classmates.

20
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,360
To be honest,

21
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,840
I've missed you these years.

22
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,270
Me, too.

23

(Romance continuing)

24
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,310
Please come now.

25
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,520
Don't be so slow.

26
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,750
Who else still hasn't set off?

Qian Wei,

28
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,750
what's wrong with you?

29
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,880
I haven't seen you the whole afternoon.

30
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
And you, Lu Xun.

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,110
It's our class reunion

32
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,040
How can you still let her work overtime?

33
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,840
I'll compensate for your loss.

34
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,240
Can you let her leave?

35
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,240
Be quick. Come on.

Hello.

39
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,630
One more dozen of beers.

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,800
Wei,

41
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,630
this is a sugar water shop.

42
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,830
Our main product is dessert.

43
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,080
But you?

44
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
You take it as a bar.

45
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,160
Don't influence your junior schoolmates.

46
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,310
My brothers and sisters,

47
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,760
please cherish

48
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,000
your college life.

49
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,800
You know that?

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,310
Don't end up like me.

51
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,590
Seven years after graduation,

52
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,870
I'm now a paralegal.

53
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,630
I once was a script editor.

54
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,680
I also worked in a foreign enterprise.

55
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,720
I even had jobs as a cook

56
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,830
and a driver.

57
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,830
I worked in many trades.

58
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,760
But I've never been in the court.

59
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,760
Things are even better now.

60
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,590
Seven years have passed.

61
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,830
My hair keeps falling out.

62
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,440
My boyfriend ran away with another girl.

63
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,910
And I don't even have a job now.

64
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
Life is so hard.

65
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,040
College is the best.

66
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,830
Do you hear me?

67
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,440
Goodbye.

68

See?

71
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
Now I can't influence them.

If sadfishing could earn me money,

73
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,160
I wouldn't have been rich.

You still come here for sugar water.

82

It's not easy for this shop

83
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,880
to continue to open.

Well,

85
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,720
every day you pop up in front of me.

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,800
Have you equipped me

87
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,030
with a positioning system?

88
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,030
Or you are Thanos?

89
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,270
Back in college,

90
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,240
every time

91
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,030
you lost to me in the exam,

92
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,160
you would come here to have water.

93
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,320
How did you know that?

94
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,630
At that time, you already thought thatâ€¦

95
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,630
I thought

96
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,390
that it must be predestined

97
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,880
that you couldn't beat me even once.

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,600
So I'm predestined

99
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,720
to be your boss.

100
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Thank you.

101
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
For eleven years,

102
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,830
you've never missed any chance

103
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,390
to laugh at me.

104
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,880
You are so "well-intentioned".

105
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,190
I do have a good intention.

106
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,600
So I don't want you to leave.

107
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,360
I remember you said

108
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,000
that you wanted to defeat me

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,270
and became the best lawyer.

110
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,070
As long as you are still

111
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,390
working in this profession,

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,640
you haven't lost the game.

113
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,880
I really hope

114
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,550
that you can win even once.

115
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,950
I also don't want to give up.

116
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,270
But I'm the person

117
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,480
who signed on the confirmation

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
of evidential material.

119
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,760
I lost their documents.

120
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,110
What else can I do to apologize

121
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,110
except for resignation?

122
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,830
I'm a bachelor

123
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,720

in seven years.

124
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,070
And I'm also a paralegal

125
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
who got the client's evidence lost.

126
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,790
No law firm will hire me now.

127
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,760
I will.

128
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,720
I'll find evidence to prove

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,000
that Lawyer Wei destroyed the exhibit

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,670
and figure out the relationship

131
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,920
between him and AES.

132
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
I've lost at first instance.

133
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,670
I'll win it back in the final judgment.

134
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,070
To escape

135
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,070
won't solve any problem

136
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,070
but will only make us lose more.

137
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm not escaping.

138
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,720
Then why can't you

139
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,440
pass the judicial exam?

140
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,950

About the exam,

146
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,230
I've tried very hard.

147
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,760
But I just can't pass it.

148
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
A talent like you

149
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,880
who's always the best

150
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
doesn't know how it feels like.

151
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,880
Actually,

152
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,790
there are many things I can't do.

153
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
But passion is not a choice.

154
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,320
It means you have no other choice.

155
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,640
Of course, I can be a good guy

156
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,390
and tell you

157
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,390
that you can't get it over

158
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,390
so you'd better stop trying.

159
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,070
It's simple for me to that.

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,670
It's so painful

161
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,830
to face up to it.

162
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,390
So you can turn back and leave.

163
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,390
But if you do that,

164
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,880
it will be a waste of you talent

165
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,230
and your capability.

166
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,270
Therefore,

167
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,550
I'd rather play a villain

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,110

169
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,790

well,

180
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,320
can you let me escape it

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,110
Oh, my things.

194
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,760
My phone.

195
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,880
My bag.

196
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,660
(Class Tree
Law Department 2011)

197
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,440
Sir,

198
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
all students of grade 2011 have come

199
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,830
except for Mo Zixin,

200
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,440
She's in another city.

201
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,230
Why is that?

202
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,000
Have you informed her?

203
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

204
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,350
This bad girl.

205
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,790
Lu Xun.

206
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,830
Distribute the shovels

207
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,160
and let them dig the wish bottles out.

208
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,270
Come on.

209
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,720
All boys.

210
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,920
Let's dig the bottles out.

211
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,480
Move.

212
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,480
Well, over ten years ago,

213
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,350
Mr. Zhen was still a middle-aged man

214
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,160
with thick hair.

215
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,480
Look at him now.

216
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,880
Only several hairs

217
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,480
hang on his head sparsely.

218
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,390
Keep your voice down.

219
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,070
Aren't you afraid

220
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,160
that Mr. Zhen will be mad at you?

221
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,830
Not at all.

222
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,670
To be frank,

223
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,110
the so-called class reunion

224
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,600
is just an occasion

225
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,160
to judge the people

226
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,350
who are not successful.

227
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,830
Do you understand?

228
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,070
Qian Wei.

229
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,160
Your hair

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,550
is pretty thick.

231
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,200
My hairstyle

232
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,230
is full of signs of years.

233
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,320
But isn't that because

234
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,150
I'm so worried about

235
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,350
all of you?

236
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:35,790
Right.

237
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,230
A mischievous student

238
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,470
can cost a hair of mine.

239
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,230
A disobedient one

240
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,960
can also cost a hair of mine.

241
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,670
But after meeting you, Qian Wei,

242
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,200
my hair never stops falling out.

243
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,150
I'm sorry

244
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,000
You've graduated for seven years.

245
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,550
Have you passed the judicial exam?

246
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,030
Back at school,

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,520
you were so indulged in love.

248
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,280
I heard that Li Chongwen

249
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,230
is now the legal director

250
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,230
of AES Group.

251
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,760
What about you two?

252
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,960
When will you get married?

253
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,030
Lu Xun,

254
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,110
you've become

255
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,840
a senior partner now.

256
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
That's a good thing.

257
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,150
But,

258
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,030
you should find time

259
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,230
to get yourself a girlfriend.

260
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,760
Back then, the relationship

261
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,440
between you and Mo Zixin isâ€¦

262
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,080
Sir.

263
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,030
I'm sorry, sir.

264
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,350
My hands are slippery.

265
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,000
So I didn't hold it well.

266
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,320
It's not your hands.

267
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,790
It's you that are slippery.

268
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,790
You did it on purpose.

269
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,710
Sir.

270
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,440
On purpose!

271
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,760
Have a rest.

272
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,470
Okay.

273
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,710
Just dig. Be quick.

274
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,000
Mr. Zhen just mentioned your love affair

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
and you got uncomfortable.

276
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,230
Move.

277
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,840
- I remember during freshman year,
- Come on, guys.

278
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,000
- you helped your brother Qian Chuan
- Be quick.

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,150
- to steal Lu Xun's girlfriend.
- Okay.

280
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you buy the ticket as a couple,

281
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,030
a decade later,

282
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,230
we will send half of the ticket

283
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,110
to both of you respectively

284
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
(Advanced Booking of Concert Tickets)
and the couples who can piece

285
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,080
the two half tickets together

286
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,200
will get a refund.

287
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,150
A decade?

288
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,280
I think within less than half a year,

289
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,640
half of these couples will break up.

290
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,440
Well,

291
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,520
this kind of activity

292
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,000
is a one-way bet for the organizers.

293
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,880
Only idiots will buy.

294
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
But so many people are waiting in line.

295
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,350
That one

296
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,030
He's a real idiot.

297
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,660
(Concert of Ten-year Appointment)

298
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,840
(Zixin just threw the ticket,)

299
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,280
(and the next minute)

300
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,710
(you let Qian Chuan express his love.)

301
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,590
(You are so skilled)

302
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,960
(in stealing others' girlfriend.)

303
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,350
Lu Xun

304
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,910
has stayed single for ten years.

305
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,280
The worst thing he has done

306
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,760
is picking on you at work.

307
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,590
It's very kind of him.

308
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,030
It's not like that.

309
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,320
Did he lose his girlfriend for my sake?

310
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,350
What I did then

311
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,080
was just a little push.

312
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,520
It's fated for us to be a couple

313
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,400
with someone.

314
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,200
And it's your fate to work under Lu Xun.

315
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,000
It's up to you today.

316
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,640
This is your bottle.

317
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,790
Here.

318
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,550
These two are yours.

319
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,200
Thank you.

320
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,670
Check whether this one is yours.

321
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,880
Let me have a look.

322
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,760
This is really mine.

323
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,440
Qian Wei,

324
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,150
you were in such a hurry just now

325
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,200
to dig the wish bottles out.

326
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,550
Why not open it?

327
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,230
Have you fulfilled your dream?

328
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,110
Without exception,

329
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,840
all wishes are still wishes.

330
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,150
But it's okay.

331
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,670
I'll put them on the door
after I go home.

332
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,440
They can help ward off evils.

333
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,110
None of them has come true?

334
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,320
I remember

335
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,550
that you used a whole page.

336
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,230
Even if God
wants to make life hard for you,

337
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,080
he should at lease

338
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,030
grant you one wish.

339
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,760
What a coincidence!

340
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,110
God hasn't missed any one of them.

341
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,280
Let me put aside big wishes

342
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,880
like "good health for parents"

343
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,840
and "success in both career and love."

344
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,590
Just this one.

345
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
"Keep a lovely dog."

346
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,400
For the time being,

347
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,230
I can barely afford to support myself.

348
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,470
It's all right.

349
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,080
Look at mine.

350
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,840
My dream

351
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,910
was to transfer to music department

352
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,710
and perform in Mercedes-Benz Arena.

353
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,200
Are you serious?

354
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,790
What.

355
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,520
What's wrong?

356
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,200
Can't I have a music dream

357
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,590
though I'm tone deaf?

358
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,670
If it's easy to realize,

359
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,710
why did I put it into the bottle?

360
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,400
Am I right?

361
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,320
Music?

362
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,670
To be honest,

363
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,840
that's a little crazy.

364
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,150
What about yours?

365
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,150
What are you doing?

366
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,230
Don't be shy.

367
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,640
Partner Lu,

368
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,840
what's your wish that hasn't come true?

369
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,150
You've already realized your dream.

370
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,080
I didn't realize it.

371
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,280
How's that possible?

372
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,790
What I wanted was

373
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,150
a wonderful love.

374
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,440
However,

375
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,440
that girl doesn't love me.

376
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,840
Qian Wei, as the forever No.2,

377
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,760
though you never defeat the No.1,

378
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,400
you've kept him single for ten years.

379
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,790
You win in some way.

380
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,790
Stop talking,

381
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Nevertheless,

382
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,520
there are plenty of fish in the sea.

383
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:40,910
Right?

384
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,550
Well,

385
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,840
as a successful and hot man,

386
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,030
Lu Xun can get any girl he wants.

387
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
If this one doesn't work, get a new one.

388
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
That's nonsense.

389
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,440
I read a book by Maugham.

390
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,080
There is a Book Review of the book.

391
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,710
It says

392
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,670
that there's a hole

393
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,590
in everyone's heart

394
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
and it needs to be filled

395
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,440
with something

396
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,280
in the same shape.

397
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,150
Maybe this thing is not perfect.

398
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,440
Maybe it's even twisted.

399
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,470
But if it's not the right person

400
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,280
to get into

401
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,590
your heart,

402
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,470
this hole will never be filled up.

403
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,640
It wasn't filled up in the past.

404
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,590
You'll have the right girl
in the future.

405
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,230
Right?

406
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,670
It can be filled up now.

407
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,100
(Mo Zixin)

408
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,760
This is Zixin's.

409
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,550
You keep it for her.

410
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,520
Why should I keep it?

411
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,030
Qian Wei.

412
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,550
You are the class monitor.

413
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,440
Qian Chuan,

414
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,590
what are you doing here?

415
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,550
Where's Zixin?

416
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,790
She's on a business trip

417
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,880
so she didn't come.

418
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,350
I'm not asking you.

419
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,790
Who do you think you are

420
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,230
to tell me

421
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,710
where she is?

422
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,030
Don't be so rude.

423
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,000
Shut up.

424
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,550
Youâ€¦

425
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,280
Don't be rude.

426
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,880
What's it?

427
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,640
Zixin's wish bottle.

428
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,550
What are you doing?

429
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,910
Zixin's wish bottle

430
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,280
should be given to her by Lu Xun.

431
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,520
Why?

432
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,110
I'm the class monitor.

433
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,030
All right.

434
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,790
Take it if you like.

435
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,470
No, no.

436
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,910
Trust me.

437
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,640
You will feel so sad

438
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,400
if you give it to him.

439
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,910
Just keep it well.

440
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,280
Well, what's the big deal, monitor?

441
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,550
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

442
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,550
Besides,

443
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,710
it's not in the law firm.

444
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,840
Why do you still take his side?

445
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,520
Give it to me.

446
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:04,790
Well,

447
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,320
I'm not taking his side.

No.

449
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,280
Don't take the bottle.

450
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,520
You don't need it.

451
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,080
Help, guys.

452
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,880
Take him away.

453
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
- I don't who's this boy.
- You want to get physical?

454
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,710
Give it to me.

455
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,710
Did you just hit me?

456
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,030

Well,

468
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,150
to be honest,

469
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,670
apparently my wishes

470
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,670
are reasonable and legitimate.

471
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,790
What's so hard to realize them?

472
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,590
Okay.

473
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,880
It's okay that they can't be realized.

474
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,200
But why does every wish go against me?

475
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,640
It's not right.

476
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,910
Now I don't even have a job.

477
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,840

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,230
How's Uncle Mo?

573
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
Is his business doing well?

574
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,070
Pretty good.

575
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
Hey, stop filming.

576
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,160
Stop, stop it.

577
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,040
(At that time,

578
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,760
(someone took photos)

579
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,950
(of Mo Zixin)

580
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,430
(Shocking! Wet show of beauty on campus!)
(and posted them on the Internet.)

581
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,520
(Shocking! Wet show of beauty on campus!)
(After that,)

582
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,950
(Mo Zixin was often gossiped)

583
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,640
(by some ill-intentioned students.)

584
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,110
(That's her.)

585
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,640
How's Uncle Mo?

586
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
Is his business

587
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,950
doing well?

588
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:52,920
Yes.

589
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,280
Pretty good.

590
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
Lu Xun,

591
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,430
are you okay?

592
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,350
Hello?

593
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,830
Is there something wrong

594
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,400
with your brain?

595
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,710
Um.

596
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,230
It's a misunderstanding.

597
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,800
It's really a misunderstanding.

598
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
I just thought

599
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,470
thatâ€¦

600
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,310
You know, this faucetâ€¦

601
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,950
Then why did you push me to the ground?

602
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,070
Are you a lunatic?

603
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,560
You made signs to me

604
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,710
in the examination room.

605
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,160
Of course I would report you.

606
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,680
Did you have to retaliate
against me like this?

607
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,950
Well,

608
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,430
he's not my boss now

609
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,070
Why should I put up with him?

610
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,880
This is the year 2011.

611
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
He's still a younger brother.

612
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,560
Hey, you!

613
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,070
Don't be so narcissistic.

614
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,950
It's just a college-opening exam.

615
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,280
Did I need to cheat?

616
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,230
Besides,

617
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,710
I'm telling you.

618
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,000
It is a sure thing

619
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that for this college-opening exam,

620
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,520
I,

621
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,230
will take the first place.

622
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:49,800
Do you hear me?

623
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,350
Who is this person?

624
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,710
Why is she so arrogant?

625
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,400
Right.

626
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,000
How dare she say that

627
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,920
in front of Lu Xun?

628
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
Well, my classmate.

629
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,590
What.

630
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,640
You don't believe it?

631
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,640
For the exam,

632
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,190
the criminal law you cited
in the last subjective question

633
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,190
has been amended.

634
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,710
The 8th amendment to Criminal Law

635
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,430
has come into effect

636
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,640
on May 1, 2011.

637
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,190
That means

638
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,000
you are wrong about that question.

639
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,070
Two points lost.

640
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,310
And, don't call me classmate.

641
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,350
I'm your elder sister.

642
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,830
I can also make a prediction.

643
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,640
From now on,

644
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,590
you will lose to me

645
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,470
in every examination,

646
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,160
every competition,

647
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,560
and every community activity.

648
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,520
This time, it's your turn

649
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,040
to be the forever No.2.

650
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Say whatever you like.

651
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,830
Don't put your hands on me.

652
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,590
I don't care.

653
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,880
Then I'll also make a prediction.

654
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,110
You'll be scolded very soon.

655
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,190
Have a guess.

656
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,070
Is my prediction correct?

657
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,230
Not everyone is a prophet.

658
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,590
Qian Wei.

659
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
The disturber of examination discipline.

660
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,040
You want to escape?

661
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,920
Come to my office.

662
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,680
Wei.

663
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,430
(From Dad)

664
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,680
(From Dad)
(Why did you hit the teacher)

665
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
(the first day in college?)

666
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,230
(Mr. Zhen called)

667
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,830
(and asked whether you were)

668
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,800
mentally deranged.)

669
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,310
(Apologize to the teacher now.)

670
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,230
(Don't get punished by the school.)

671
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,160
2011

672
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,110
Right.

673
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,160
Dad is still alive.

674
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,280
Well, sir.

675
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,040
There's something urgent at home.

676
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Can I go home first?

677
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,190
I'll come back to you very soon.

678
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
Is it that urgent?

679
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,110
Fine.

680
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,400
Then you don't need to come.

681
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,590
You'll receive
a disciplinary warning next week.

682
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,880
Isn't a nine o'clock curfew too early?

683
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,880
In the future,

684
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,040
this is just the beginning

685
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
of nightlife.

686
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,430
This door still remains unrepaired.

687
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:44,950
Tonight,

688
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,230
I will take Qian Yanping

689
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,950
to go to hospital.

690
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,710
I'll get him cured first.

691
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,000
Then I'll turn the tables.

692
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,470
It's so late.

693
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,470
Why are you going out?

694
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,280
You!

695
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,590
What are you doing?

696
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,680
Are you all right?

697
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,000
Well,

698
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,190
I'm not

699
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,230
trying to get out.

700
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,310
It's just thatâ€¦

701
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,590
Iâ€¦ I want toâ€¦

702
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,800
Are you hungry?

703
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,920
It's okay.

704
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
I also plan to go out for some food.

705
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,760
Let's go together.

706
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,590
How about this?

707
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,560
You come down first.

708
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,520
I'll go up

709
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,430
and then pull you up.

710
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,590
Come on.

711
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,590
Well, it doesn't

712
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,710
feel right.

713
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,310
Actually, Iâ€¦

714
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,070
Don't worry.

715
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,640
It's not like I must get out.

716
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,430
Don't be afraid.

717
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,280
I am also a student.

718
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm from Grade 2010, law department.

719
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,680
My name is Li Chongwen.

720
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,400
My name is Qian Wei.

721
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,560
- Why are you doing this?
- Please wait.

722
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
Why do you haunt me?

723
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,470
Let go of me.

724
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,000
Go away.

725
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,040
You are annoying.

726
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,470
Youâ€¦

727
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,400
Do you know me?

728
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,470
I don't

729
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,190
I don't want to know you

730
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,070
in the past, now and in the future.

731
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,880
Stay away from me.

732
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,920
You were trying

733
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,350
to climb the wall just now.

734
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,280
I just want to give you a hand.

735
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
I won't take advantage of you.

736
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,800
Stop it.

737
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,880
Stay away from me!

738
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,950
Give me a hand? I don't need it.

739
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,950
If you enjoy helping others so much,

740
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,000
you can be Aquaman.

741
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,560
Then you'd better study

742
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
in the ocean department.

743
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,280
Law department is not right for you.

744
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,590
Aquaâ€¦ Aquaman?

745
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,880
I can't swim.

746
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,070
What? Who's Aquaman?

747
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,880
You don't need to know.

748
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,470
Go away.

749
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,350
Stay away from me.

750
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,950
What are you doing again?

751
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,470
Qian Wei.

752
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,110
You,

753
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,880
cheated in the exam,

754
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,070
hit your senior

755
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,350
and climbed the wall to get out.

756
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,560
What do you want?

757
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,400
You broke more school rules in a day

758
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,110
than others break in a year.

759
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,070
Do you have to get yourself

760
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,070
a disciplinary measure?

761
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,760
Don't give me that look.

762
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,470
Resentment?

763
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,190
Are you all right, Senior Li?

764
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,520
It's okay.

765
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,430
In the future, you will have

766
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,400
a tit-for-tat fight.

767
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
The scene of you two getting along

768
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,280
makes me feel uncomfortable.

769
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,470
We were studying how to climb the walls.

770
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,680
Somehow,

771
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,710
she suddenly got upset.

772
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,520
You got it wrong.

773
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,190
He didn't get it wrong.

774
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,310
I was hitting you.

775
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,190
And afterwards,

776
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,520
if you get close to me again,

777
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,070
I willâ€¦

778
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,000
Go to eat something.

779
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,680
Your stomach keeps rumbling.

780
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,880
I'll hit you every time I see you.

781
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Don't laugh. I mean it.

782
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,710
You're threatening him,

783
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,800
my classmate.

784
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,880
In serious cases, you'll get detained.

785
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,520
Do you want to live here

786
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,880
or go to the police station

787
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,160
for tonight?

788
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,110
Who are you?

789
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,230
It's none of your business.

790
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,160
The teacher made me be acting monitor.

791
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,710
So many things happened
on the first day.

792
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,160
Where's the face

793
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,230
of Law Department 2011?

794
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,070
It's all because of you.

795
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,400
Acting monitor. Wow, you are so great!

796
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,070
Do you think you are my boss?

797
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,400
As for Law Department 2011,

798
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,310
I have plenty of time

799
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,880
to gain glory for it.

800
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,760
Don't you worry about it!

801
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,430
Goodbye.

802
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,000
Come back.

803
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,070
What!

804
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,560
Look at yourself.

805
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,920
You are just fooling around.

806
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,590
You'd spend tonight

807
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,430
safe and sound first.

808
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,040
Take it.

809
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,350
Why should I take it for you?

810
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,000
Come on.

811
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,040
Be a good girl. Take it.

812
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:25,710
I won't take it for you.

813
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,470
Take it.

814
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,880
Go!

815
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,400
Well,

816
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,040
I need to get out.

817
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,880
It's urgent.

818
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,560
Stop talking.

819
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,430
I have an emergency.

820
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,350
Can Iâ€¦

821
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,000
Let me get out.

822
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,680
I'm come back soon.

823
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,640
No way.

824
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
Don't tug at my clothes.

825
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,400
I'm talking to you.

826
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,430
Are you a kangaroo?

827
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,920
Don't jump around.

828
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,680
Well, take your thing.

829
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,160
I'll go myself.

830
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,310
Take the bag yourself.

831
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,950
Well.

832
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,430
Qian Wei, wait. Stop!

833
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,830
Help! Don't chase me.

834
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,800
Qian Wei.

835
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,760
Qian Wei.

836
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,000
It's our first time to be roommates.

837
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,350
You don't need to be so nice.

838
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,880
Qian Wei,

839
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,560
you also don't need to be so impulsive.

840
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,830
Done.

841
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,230
I,

842
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,920
am very satisfied

843
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,680
with this hairstyle.

844
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,350
It does look good.

845
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,230
You two

846
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,110
are like Iron Man,

847
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,760
aren't you?

848
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
You equipped our dormitory

849
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,680
with water dispenser

850
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,830
and refrigerator.

851
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,560
To be honest,

852
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm not as rich as you are,

853
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,830
but I have some experience.

854
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,710
For girls studying law like us,

855
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,640
baldness is a common problem.

856
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,520
If we directly

857
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,190
tie our hair up,

858
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,560
it's easier for us to get bald.

859
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,640
Therefore, this bangs

860
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,190
and these hair-growing products

861
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,950
are my best wishes

862
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,430
to your Lisa,

863
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,470
Linda and Amanda.

864
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,760
Lisa, Linda, Amanda?

865
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,710
Who are they?

866
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,800
Sweet,

867
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,110
each hair

868
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,880
of each bald girl

869
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,230
deserves a name.

870
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,280
You'll understand ten years later.

871
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,590
Come on.

872
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,430
Stop your bullshit.

873
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,400
Ten years?

874
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,470
I don't buy it.

875
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,590
You don't believe me, right?

876
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,590
It's time to show you

877
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,920
my status and superpower.

878
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,280
In your fridge

879
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,920
is all beers.

880
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,470
How do you know it?

881
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,280
At that time,

882
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,110
I was conquered

883
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,190
by Big Sister Liu

884
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,160
with this fridge of beers.

885
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,230
I have two more suggestions.

886
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,590
Don't hide the fridge

887
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,400
under the table.

888
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Otherwise,

889
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,430
Aunt Ma will confiscate it

890
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,160
as an illegal appliance
the day after tomorrow

891
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,430
I know.

892
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,430
You'll say you can buy it again.

893
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,430
Am I right?

894
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,160
What a waste of these beers!

895
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,470
Isn't it?

896
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,590
You can't squander money like that.

897
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,280
One more thing,

898
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
an underwear stealer

899
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,310
will frequent here recently.

900
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,040
So you must put your underwear

901
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,950
and precious things

902
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,520
in a safe place.

903
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,070
Do you understand?

904
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,230
Okay.

905
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,430
You make me jumpy.

906
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,920
Since they'll be gone

907
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,520
the day after tomorrow,

908
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,560
let's drink them all today.

909
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,310
Um, drink now?

910
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,000
Drink.

911
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,800
Zixin, can you drink beers?

912
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,430
Of course.

913
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,640
A friends with status?

914
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,760
That's rare.

915
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,040
I,

916
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
decide to befriend with you.

917
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,470
To our pretty hair!

918
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,800
To our youth!

919
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,040
To turn the tables!

920
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,350
To get rich!

921
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
What do you mean by turning the tables?

922
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,830
It means that we can have

923
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,880
whatever we want and a cool life.

924
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,950
Turn the tables?

925
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,280
Right.

926
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,350
To turn the tables!

927
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,280
To turn the tables!

928
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,190
Come on. Cheers!

00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,880
I miss you so much.

955
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,470
This child

956
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,590
(Opening Ceremony)
Wei, come down.

957
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,880
(Opening Ceremony)
No, I want to hug him.

958
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,160
Your father

959
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,680
can't hold your weight.

960
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,430
Let me carry her for a while.

961
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,040
How nice it is!

962
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,160
Stop showing off.

963
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,040
It's okay, girl.

964
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,190
It's so nice to have a daughter.

965
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,070
You miss Dad, right?

966
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,350
Stay on my back.

967
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,950
No worries.

968
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,800
I can carry you for long.

969
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,470
I'm a little trembling.

970
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,470
But it's not my legs.

971
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,470
It's because of the music.

972
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,430
Come down.

973
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
All right. It's okay.

974
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,520
You are better than Qian Chuan.

975
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,920
That boy.

976
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,310
He didn't even show up to welcome me.

977
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,640
Are you OK?

978
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,060
(2011 Opening Ceremony
of Guanghua University)

979
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,470
Slow down.

980
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,230
Be careful.

981
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,000
Thank you

982
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,600
Li Peng.

983
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,280
Be careful.

984
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,080
Watch the steps.

985
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,000
Watch out.

986
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,150
Ten minutes left.

987
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,190
Is everyone here?

988
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,150
They'll come.

989
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,620
(2011 Opening Ceremony
of Guanghua University)

990
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,630
Where is Qian Wei again?

991
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:32,910
By the way,

992
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
I bought a gift

993
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,560
for entering college.

994
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,600
The tour guide

995
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,760
recommended this to me

996
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,520
when I was traveling in Tibet.

997
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,840
And it cost me a lot.

998
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,000
The guide said

999
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,080
that you can reverse the situation

1000
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,560
when you're at a low point

1001
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,150
in your life

1002
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
by twisting this little wheel.

1003
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,760
How did you know that?

1004
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,230
That's what he said.

1005
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,560
You were ripped off again.

1006
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,430
And don't keep saying things

1007
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,870
like avoiding the low point of life.

1008
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,630
Do you know Murphy's Law?

1009
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,950
You don't want something to happen,

1010
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,520
but it will still happen.

1011
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,000
Besides,

1012
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,670
I think

1013
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,150
my life is very good now.

1014
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,000
There's nothing I want to change.

1015
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,630
No, don't.

1016
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't throw it.

1017
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,360
Who's Murphy?

1018
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,040
I don't know him.

1019
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,230
Why should I trust him?

1020
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,390
Look,

1021
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,670
you will know

1022
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,190
how important this little thing is

1023
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,710
when the time comes.

1024
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,910
You can ask me for it

1025
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,670
when you need it.

1026
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,630
But for my fat thumb

1027
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,230
which can't wear it,

1028
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,630
I wouldn't have given it to you.

1029
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,470
I'll keep it for now.

1030
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,910
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Qian,

1031
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,150
there are just five minutes

1032
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,000
before the ceremony starts.

1033
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,230
How about
taking your seats inside first?

1034
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

1035
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,800
No, no, no.

1036
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
We'll go to hospital first.

1037
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,910
Go to hospital?

1038
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,080
It's you.

1039
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,840
Not me.

1040
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,000
What about me?

1041
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,390
Last night, I dreamed

1042
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,710
that you had acute leukemia.

1043
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,080
So now I must take you

1044
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,470
to hospital for a checkup.

1045
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,360
What do you mean?

1046
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,360
What's the matter with you?

1047
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,470
What disease do I have?

1048
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,630
You don't believe me, right?

1049
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,230
Let me tell you,

1050
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,390
I also dreamed

1051
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,080
that you hid your private money

1052
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
in your long johns.

1053
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,190
And Mom's birthday present this year

1054
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,150
is hidden inâ€¦

1055
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,280
No, stop.

1056
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,360
I'll take her to hospital.

1057
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,840
This kid is ill.

1058
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,360
Wait.

1059
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,040
Mr. Qian.

1060
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,870
Only five minutes left.

1061
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,710
It's okay to have dreams.

1062
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,840
But could you dream after the ceremony?

1063
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,150
No.

1064
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,430
The ceremony is just a formality.

1065
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,950
It's not important.

1066
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,840
My thing is urgent.

1067
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,040
I've promised the head teacher

1068
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,430
to hold the ceremony well.

1069
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,520
I must keep my promise.

1070
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,840
My mother is a doctor.

1071
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,840
If

1072
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
you need it,

1073
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll let herâ€¦

1074
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,630
It's you who promised the head teacher.

1075
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,390
I have nothing to do with it.

1076
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:30,870
Go.

1077
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,390
Let's go.

1078
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,120
No, no.

1079
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,230
We should go now.

1080
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,760
You must go to hospital now.

1081
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,360
Hey, you!

1082
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,420
(Welcome 2011 freshmen!)

1083
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,020
(Outpatient Department)

1084
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,670
See? There's no big problem.

1085
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,360
Don't be afraid.

1086
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,120
But this indicator is a little high.

1087
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,080
Have some grapes.

1088
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,390
The Greek grape growers
grow Greek grapes.

1089
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,000
Good.

1090
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,230
So sour.

1091
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,800
It's not.

1092
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,710
Your Uncle Wang from next door

1093
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,190
said that his daughter

1094
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,120
brought him a box of

1095
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,670
cherries.

1096
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,430
American cherries.

1097
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,150
Cherries

1098
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,150
from America.

1099
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,470
And?

1100
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,000
He said that it was very sweet.

1101
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,150
I said I wanted to try one.

1102
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,080
He refused to give me any.

1103
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,390
What a stingy man!

1104
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,280
But his daughter is so great!

1105
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,670
If you want some, just say it.

1106
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,190
No need to speak in riddles.

1107
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,360
No, I'm not.

1108
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,280
I'll take the grapes away.

1109
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,470
Hello.

1110
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,120
(Cherry)
Is this 386 yuan per kg?

1111
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,710
Yes.

1112
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,190
That's "cheap".

1113
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,320
Dad doesn't want to eat this.

1114
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,000
Dad doesn't want to eat this.

1115
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,360
He can have tomatoes.

1116
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,080
Isn't it just 200 yuan?

1117
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,190
Why was I being such a cheapskate then?

1118
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,040
Before his death,

1119
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,520
Dad had never eaten cherries.

1120
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,280
Are you okay?

1121
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm not.

1122
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,670
Can you lend me 500 yuan?

1123
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,390
What? Five hundred?

1124
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,280
I don't have 500 yuan.

1125
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,190
I don't have that much money.

1126
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,800
Your mom

1127
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,760
will come back

1128
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,000
in a while.

1129
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,760
You can ask her.

1130
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,560
I can't.

1131
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,390
If I ask her for money,

1132
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,190
she will ask

1133
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,080
what's the use for it.

1134
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,190
You borrow from me

1135
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,560
and I will also ask you about its use.

1136
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
It's clearly better to borrow from you.

1137
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,600
Can you lend me some?

1138
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,320
Come on.

1139
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,390
I really don't have that much money.

1140
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,120
Stop it.

1141
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,190
We just met a few days ago.

1142
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,600
Do I know you well?

1143
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,190
It's okay.

1144
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,000
We were strangers yesterday.

1145
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,760
We are acquaintances today.

1146
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,000
If you lend me the money,

1147
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,150
we'll become good friends.

1148
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,120
No way.

1149
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,430
I don't want a friend

1150
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,470
like you.

1151
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,390
I really don't have money.

1152
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,670
Come on.

1153
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,150
Don't be like this.

1154
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,150
I really need the money.

1155
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,840
- I'll use it for a good purpose.
- No.

1156
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Look,

1157
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,470
don't put your hands on me.

1158
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,390
This is my money.

1159
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,470
Besides,

1160
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,710
it's okay that your parents

1161
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,230
see you touching me.

1162
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,280
But if my mom sees it,

1163
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,670
what will she think of me?

1164
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,950
Do you really refuse to lend it to me?

1165
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Okay.

1166
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,360
If you don't lend me the money,

1167
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm really not sure

1168
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,000
what your mother

1169
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,600
will think of you.

1170
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,760
I don't understand

1171
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,390
what you just said.

1172
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,760
I don't have that much money.

1173
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,390
All I haveâ€¦

1174
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,040
Mr. Lu Xun, lend me some money.

1175
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,800
Please.

1176
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,280
Thank you.

1177
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,280
My living allowance.

1178
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,950
500, just 500.

1179
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,470
If we really live to that age,

1180
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,390
how happy we'll be!

1181
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,910
Right.

1182
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,600
How's it going?

1183
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,320
Wei,

1184
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,670
guess what the doctor said?

1185
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,950
Anything wrong?

1186
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,280
Nothing wrong.

1187
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,840
That's nice.

1188
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,910
Early checkup is useful.

1189
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,390
Dad, this is for you.

1190
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,320
Cherries imported from America.

1191
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,390
Oh, dear.

1192
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,710
Eat as much as you want.

1193
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,760
Others have it.

1194
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,360
You can also have it.

1195
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,710
Good.

1196
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,520
So expensive?

1197
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,470
(American Cherry)

1198
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,000
Wei,

1199
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,360
several boxes of this can cost

1200
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,760
your monthly living allowances.

1201
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,080
Well, money doesn't matter.

1202
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,560
What matters is that you are happy.

1203
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:33,800
Right?

1204
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,190
Yes, right.

1205
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,120
Dad,

1206
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,800
one more thing.

1207
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,910
Could you quit the job

1208
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,320
in that parts processing factory?

1209
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,150
That workplace is so filthy.

1210
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,150
And it's such a closed environment.

1211
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,190
There must be

1212
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,950
excessive chemicals inside.

1213
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,520
It can lead to blood disease easily.

1214
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,950
You've already reached

1215
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,910
the age of retirement.

1216
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,760
Just retire early.

1217
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,280
How can I retire?

1218
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,150
The company needs me.

1219
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,630
Will the factory close down
if you retire?

1220
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,150
Wei is right.

1221
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,470
No one is as busy as you

1222
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,360
at this age.

1223
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,630
I want you to retire.

1224
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,840
All right.

1225
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,760
You're the boss.

1226
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,600
I'll take your mother to dinner.

1227
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,600
Let's celebrate.

1228
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,560
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Qian.

1229
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,600
Goodbye.

1230
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,600
We can have

1231
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,390
Bread Soaked in Fish Head Soup.

1232
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,190
Lu Xun.

1233
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,320
Thank you for today.

1234
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,670
You let my father do a full examination

1235
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,230
and lent me the money.

1236
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,040
I'll buy you dinner

1237
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,190
Do you like hot-spicy pot,

1238
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,600
spicy hot pot, or what?

1239
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,080
Both okay.

1240
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,760
It's up to you.

1241
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,040
I,

1242
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,150
don't want food.

1243
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,710
I want the money.

1244
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,360
And,

1245
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
what's the cherry that you bought?

1246
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,840
Five hundred yuan

1247
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,360
for just two boxes.

1248
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,000
It's not ordinary cheery.

1249
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,520
It's imported from America.

1250
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,320
What's more,

1251
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,150
don't be so narrow-mined.

1252
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,870
It's just some money.

1253
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,120
I'll return it to you.

1254
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,630
I really want to get on well with you

1255
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,670
for the next four years.

1256
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,280
During the four years,

1257
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,670
how much money will you owe me?

1258
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,670
I already regret

1259
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,470
wasting so much time

1260
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,600
with you.

1261
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,470
And can you stop interrupting me

1262
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,150
when I'm not finished yet?

1263
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,950
If you

1264
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,390
want to be a troublesome girl,

1265
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,560
no problem

1266
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,280
But don't get others involved,

1267
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,430
especially me.

1268
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,320
Do you understand?

1269
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,560
Yes.

1270
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,520
No matter in 2022

1271
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,600
or in 2011,

1272
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,520
this person

1273
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,280
is just equally annoying.

1274
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,890
â™ªYou're the one for the rest of my lifeâ™ª

1275
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,210
â™ªEven stars can't be as shiny as youâ™ª

1276
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,340
â™ªIn such a worldâ™ª

1277
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,450
â™ªI love no one but youâ™ª

1278
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,200
â™ªYou're the one for the rest of my lifeâ™ª

1279
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,470
â™ªEven stars can't be as shiny as youâ™ª

1280
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,740
â™ªIn such a worldâ™ª

1281
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,890
â™ªI love no one but youâ™ª

1282
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,000
â™ªYou're the one for the rest of my lifeâ™ª

1283
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,080
â™ªEven stars can't be as shiny as youâ™ª

1284
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,210
â™ªIn such a worldâ™ª

1285
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,560
â™ªI love no one but youâ™ª

1286
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,930
â™ªI've got countless things to doâ™ª

1287
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,100
â™ªPossibilities never endâ™ª

1288
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,010
â™ªI force myself to do it allâ™ª

1289
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,190
â™ªI'm lucky to have you in my futureâ™ª

1290
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,160
â™ªWho will do everything with meâ™ª

1291
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,350
â™ªEven if I have to loseâ™ª

1292
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,500
â™ªNumberless thingsâ™ª

1293
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,230
â™ªEven if I have to lose everythingâ™ª

1294
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,580
â™ªI can't live without youâ™ª

1295
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,590
â™ªOne of seven billionâ™ª

1296
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,750
â™ªI also cherish your soul so muchâ™ª

1297
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,050
â™ªGirl I swear I love youâ™ª

1298
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,860
â™ªWithout reservation Be my only girlâ™ª

1299
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,990
â™ªYou're my only girlâ™ª

1300
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,500
â™ªThe most beautiful memoryâ™ª

1301
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,070
â™ªThe most special definitionâ™ª

1302
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:28,640
â™ªYeah babyâ™ª

1303
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,780
â™ªI'll fight the world for youâ™ª

1304
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,150
â™ªI want to grow old with youâ™ª

1305
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,950
â™ªAnd travel around the world togetherâ™ª

1306
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,310
â™ªWherever you areâ™ª

1307
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,060
â™ªIt's my whole worldâ™ª

1308
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,200
â™ªI'm your umbrellaâ™ª

1309
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,720
â™ªI'll shelter everything for youâ™ª

1310
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,140
â™ªI'll shelter everything for youâ™ª

1311
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,130
â™ªLet's travel
across the most beautiful borderâ™ª

1312
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,460
â™ªWithout saying goodbyeâ™ª

1313
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,990
â™ªWhat has excited usâ™ª

1314
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,460
â™ªOur love in the precious life yeahâ™ª

1315
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,930
â™ªLie down and enjoy the skyâ™ª

1316
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,200
â™ªI hold you in my armsâ™ª

1317
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,140
â™ªYou're the one for the rest of my lifeâ™ª

1318
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,260
â™ªEven stars can't be as shiny as youâ™ª

1319
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,540
â™ªIn such a worldâ™ª

1320
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,710
