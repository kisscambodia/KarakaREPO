6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,680
I don't allow anyone

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,390
to leave the karaoke room sober.

8

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,190
Cheers.

10
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,520
Come on.

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,000
Friends,

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,470
my wife is expecting our second child.

13
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,600
I'll go home to keep her accompany.

14
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,230
You have fun.

15
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,680
I'll leave first.

(Happy family)

17
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,600
You see your wife and child every day.

18
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,390
But it's not easy for us

19
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,520
to meet as old classmates.

20
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,360
To be honest,

21
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,840
I've missed you these years.

22
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,270
Me, too.

23

(Romance continuing)

24
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,310
Please come now.

25
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,520
Don't be so slow.

26
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,750
Who else still hasn't set off?

Qian Wei,

28
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,750
what's wrong with you?

29
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,880
I haven't seen you the whole afternoon.

30
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
And you, Lu Xun.

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,110
It's our class reunion

32
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,040
How can you still let her work overtime?

33
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,840
I'll compensate for your loss.

34
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,240
Can you let her leave?

35
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,240
Be quick. Come on.

Hello.

39
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,630
One more dozen of beers.

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,800
Wei,

41
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,630
this is a sugar water shop.

42
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,830
Our main product is dessert.

43
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,080
But you?

44
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
You take it as a bar.

45
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,160
Don't influence your junior schoolmates.

46
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,310
My brothers and sisters,

47
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,760
please cherish

48
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,000
your college life.

49
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,800
You know that?

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,310
Don't end up like me.

51
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,590
Seven years after graduation,

52
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,870
I'm now a paralegal.

53
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,630
I once was a script editor.

54
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,680
I also worked in a foreign enterprise.

55
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,720
I even had jobs as a cook

56
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,830
and a driver.

57
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,830
I worked in many trades.

58
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,760
But I've never been in the court.

59
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,760
Things are even better now.

60
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,590
Seven years have passed.

61
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,830
My hair keeps falling out.

62
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,440
My boyfriend ran away with another girl.

63
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,910
And I don't even have a job now.

64
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
Life is so hard.

65
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,040
College is the best.

66
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,830
Do you hear me?

67
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,440
Goodbye.

68

See?

71
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
Now I can't influence them.

If sadfishing could earn me money,

73
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,160
I wouldn't have been rich.

You still come here for sugar water.

82

It's not easy for this shop

83

Well,

85

every day you pop up in front of me.

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,800
Have you equipped me

87
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,030
with a positioning system?

88
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,030
Or you are Thanos?

89
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,270
Back in college,

90
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,240
every time

91
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,030
you lost to me in the exam,

92
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,160
you would come here to have water.

93
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,320
How did you know that?

94
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,630
At that time, you already thought that…

95
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,630
I thought

96
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,390
that it must be predestined

97
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,880
that you couldn't beat me even once.

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,600
So I'm predestined

99
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,720
to be your boss.

100
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Thank you.

101
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
For eleven years,

102
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,830
you've never missed any chance

103
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,390
to laugh at me.

104
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,880
You are so "well-intentioned".

105
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,190
I do have a good intention.

106
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,600
So I don't want you to leave.

107
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,360
I remember you said

108
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,000
that you wanted to defeat me

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,270
and became the best lawyer.

110
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,070
As long as you are still

111
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,390
working in this profession,

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,640
you haven't lost the game.

113
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,880
I really hope

114
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,550
that you can win even once.

115
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,950
I also don't want to give up.

116
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,270
But I'm the person

117
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,480
who signed on the confirmation

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
of evidential material.

119
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,760
I lost their documents.

120
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,110
What else can I do to apologize

121
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,110
except for resignation?

122
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,830
I'm a bachelor

123
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,720

in seven years.

124
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,070
And I'm also a paralegal

125
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
who got the client's evidence lost.

126
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,790
No law firm will hire me now.

127
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,760
I will.

128
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,720
I'll find evidence to prove

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,000
that Lawyer Wei destroyed the exhibit

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,670
and figure out the relationship

131
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,920
between him and AES.

132
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
I've lost at first instance.

133
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,670
I'll win it back in the final judgment.

134
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,070
To escape

135
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,070
won't solve any problem

136
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,070
but will only make us lose more.

137
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm not escaping.

138
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,720
Then why can't you

139
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,440
pass the judicial exam?

140
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,950

About the exam,

146
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,230
I've tried very hard.

147
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,760
But I just can't pass it.

148
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
A talent like you

who's always the best

150
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
doesn't know how it feels like.

151
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,880
Actually,

152
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,790
there are many things I can't do.

153
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
But passion is not a choice.

154
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,320
It means you have no other choice.

155
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,640
Of course, I can be a good guy

156
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,390
and tell you

157
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,390
that you can't get it over

158
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,390
so you'd better stop trying.

159
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,070
It's simple for me to that.

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,670
It's so painful

161
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,830
to face up to it.

162
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,390
So you can turn back and leave.

163
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,390
But if you do that,

164
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,880
it will be a waste of you talent

165
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,230
and your capability.

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,270
Therefore,

167
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,550
I'd rather play a villain

169
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,790

well,

180
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,320
can you let me escape it

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,110
Oh, my things.

194
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,760
My phone.

195
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,880
My bag.

196
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,660
(Class Tree
Law Department 2011)

197
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,440
Sir,

198
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
all students of grade 2011 have come

199
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,830
except for Mo Zixin,

200
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,440
She's in another city.

201
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,230
Why is that?

202
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,000
Have you informed her?

203
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

204
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,350
This bad girl.

205
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,790
Lu Xun.

206
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,830
Distribute the shovels

207
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,160
and let them dig the wish bottles out.

208
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,270
Come on.

209
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,720
All boys.

210
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,920
Let's dig the bottles out.

211
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,480
Move.

212
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,480
Well, over ten years ago,

213
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,350
Mr. Zhen was still a middle-aged man

214
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,160
with thick hair.

215
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,480
Look at him now.

216
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,880
Only several hairs

217
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,480
hang on his head sparsely.

218
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,390
Keep your voice down.

219
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,070
Aren't you afraid

220
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,160
that Mr. Zhen will be mad at you?

221
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,830
Not at all.

222
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,670
To be frank,

223
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,110
the so-called class reunion

224
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,600
is just an occasion

225
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,160
to judge the people

226
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,350
who are not successful.

227
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,830
Do you understand?

228
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,070
Qian Wei.

229
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,160
Your hair

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,550
is pretty thick.

231
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,200
My hairstyle

232
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,230
is full of signs of years.

233
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,320
But isn't that because

234
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,150
I'm so worried about

235
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,350
all of you?

236
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:35,790
Right.

237
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,230
A mischievous student

238
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,470
can cost a hair of mine.

239
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,230
A disobedient one

240
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,960
can also cost a hair of mine.

241
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,670
But after meeting you, Qian Wei,

242
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,200
my hair never stops falling out.

243
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,150
I'm sorry

244
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,000
You've graduated for seven years.

245
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,550
Have you passed the judicial exam?

246
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,030
Back at school,

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,520
you were so indulged in love.

248
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,280
I heard that Li Chongwen

249
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,230
is now the legal director

250
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,230
of AES Group.

251
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,760
What about you two?

252
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,960
When will you get married?

253
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,030
Lu Xun,

254
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,110
you've become

255
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,840
a senior partner now.

256
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
That's a good thing.

257
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,150
But,

258
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,030
you should find time

259
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,230
to get yourself a girlfriend.

260
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,760
Back then, the relationship

261
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,440
between you and Mo Zixin is…

262
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,080
Sir.

263
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,030
I'm sorry, sir.

264
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,350
My hands are slippery.

265
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,000
So I didn't hold it well.

266
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,320
It's not your hands.

267
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,790
It's you that are slippery.

268
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,790
You did it on purpose.

269
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,710
Sir.

270
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,440
On purpose!

271
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,760
Have a rest.

272
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,470
Okay.

273
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,710
Just dig. Be quick.

274
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,000
Mr. Zhen just mentioned your love affair

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
and you got uncomfortable.

276
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,230
Move.

277
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,840
- I remember during freshman year,
- Come on, guys.

278
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,000
- you helped your brother Qian Chuan
- Be quick.

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,150
- to steal Lu Xun's girlfriend.
- Okay.

280
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you buy the ticket as a couple,

281
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,030
a decade later,

282
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,230
we will send half of the ticket

283
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,110
to both of you respectively

284
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
(Advanced Booking of Concert Tickets)
and the couples who can piece

285
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,080
the two half tickets together

286
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,200
will get a refund.

287
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,150
A decade?

288
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,280
I think within less than half a year,

289
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,640
half of these couples will break up.

290
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,440
Well,

291
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,520
this kind of activity

292
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,000
is a one-way bet for the organizers.

293
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,880
Only idiots will buy.

294
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
But so many people are waiting in line.

295
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,350
That one

296
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,030
He's a real idiot.

297
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,660
(Concert of Ten-year Appointment)

298
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,840
(Zixin just threw the ticket,)

299
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,280
(and the next minute)

300
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,710
(you let Qian Chuan express his love.)

301
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,590
(You are so skilled)

302
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,960
(in stealing others' girlfriend.)

303
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,350
Lu Xun

304
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,910
has stayed single for ten years.

305
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,280
The worst thing he has done

306
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,760
is picking on you at work.

307
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,590
It's very kind of him.

308
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,030
It's not like that.

309
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,320
Did he lose his girlfriend for my sake?

310
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,350
What I did then

311
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,080
was just a little push.

312
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,520
It's fated for us to be a couple

313
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,400
with someone.

314
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,200
And it's your fate to work under Lu Xun.

315
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,000
It's up to you today.

316
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,640
This is your bottle.

317
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,790
Here.

318
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,550
These two are yours.

319
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,200
Thank you.

320
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,670
Check whether this one is yours.

321
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,880
Let me have a look.

322
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,760
This is really mine.

323
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,440
Qian Wei,

324
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,150
you were in such a hurry just now

325
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,200
to dig the wish bottles out.

326
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,550
Why not open it?

327
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,230
Have you fulfilled your dream?

328
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,110
Without exception,

329
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,840
all wishes are still wishes.

330
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,150
But it's okay.

331
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,670
I'll put them on the door
after I go home.

332
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,440
They can help ward off evils.

333
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,110
None of them has come true?

334
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,320
I remember

335
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,550
that you used a whole page.

336
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,230
Even if God
wants to make life hard for you,

337
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,080
he should at lease

338
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,030
grant you one wish.

339
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,760
What a coincidence!

340
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,110
God hasn't missed any one of them.

341
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,280
Let me put aside big wishes

342
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,880
like "good health for parents"

343
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,840
and "success in both career and love."

344
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,590
Just this one.

345
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
"Keep a lovely dog."

346
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,400
For the time being,

347
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,230
I can barely afford to support myself.

348
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,470
It's all right.

349
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,080
Look at mine.

350
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,840
My dream

351
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,910
was to transfer to music department

352
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,710
and perform in Mercedes-Benz Arena.

353
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,200
Are you serious?

354
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,790
What.

355
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,520
What's wrong?

356
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,200
Can't I have a music dream

357
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,590
though I'm tone deaf?

358
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,670
If it's easy to realize,

359
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,710
why did I put it into the bottle?

360
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,400
Am I right?

361
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,320
Music?

362
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,670
To be honest,

363
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,840
that's a little crazy.

364
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,150
What about yours?

365
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,150
What are you doing?

366
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,230
Don't be shy.

367
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,640
Partner Lu,

368
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,840
what's your wish that hasn't come true?

369
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,150
You've already realized your dream.

370
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,080
I didn't realize it.

371
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,280
How's that possible?

372
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,790
What I wanted was

373
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,150
a wonderful love.

374
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,440
However,

375
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,440
that girl doesn't love me.

376
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,840
Qian Wei, as the forever No.2,

377
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,760
though you never defeat the No.1,

378
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,400
you've kept him single for ten years.

379
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,790
You win in some way.

380
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,790
Stop talking,

381
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Nevertheless,

382
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,520
there are plenty of fish in the sea.

383
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:40,910
Right?

384
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,550
Well,

385
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,840
as a successful and hot man,

386
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,030
Lu Xun can get any girl he wants.

387
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
If this one doesn't work, get a new one.

388
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
That's nonsense.

389
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,440
I read a book by Maugham.

390
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,080
There is a Book Review of the book.

391
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,710
It says

392
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,670
that there's a hole

393
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,590
in everyone's heart

394
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
and it needs to be filled

395
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,440
with something

396
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,280
in the same shape.

397
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,150
Maybe this thing is not perfect.

398
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,440
Maybe it's even twisted.

399
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,470
But if it's not the right person

400
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,280
to get into

401
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,590
your heart,

402
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,470
this hole will never be filled up.

403
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,640
It wasn't filled up in the past.

404
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,590
You'll have the right girl
in the future.

405
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,230
Right?

406
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,670
It can be filled up now.

407
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,100
(Mo Zixin)

408
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,760
This is Zixin's.

409
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,550
You keep it for her.

410
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,520
Why should I keep it?

411
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,030
Qian Wei.

412
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,550
You are the class monitor.

413
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,440
Qian Chuan,

414
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,590
what are you doing here?

415
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,550
Where's Zixin?

416
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,790
She's on a business trip

417
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,880
so she didn't come.

418
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,350
I'm not asking you.

419
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,790
Who do you think you are

420
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,230
to tell me

421
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,710
where she is?

422
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,030
Don't be so rude.

423
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,000
Shut up.

424
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,550
You…

425
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,280
Don't be rude.

426
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,880
What's it?

427
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,640
Zixin's wish bottle.

428
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,550
What are you doing?

429
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,910
Zixin's wish bottle

430
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,280
should be given to her by Lu Xun.

431
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,520
Why?

432
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,110
I'm the class monitor.

433
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,030
All right.

434
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,790
Take it if you like.

435
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,470
No, no.

436
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,910
Trust me.

437
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,640
You will feel so sad

438
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,400
if you give it to him.

439
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,910
Just keep it well.

440
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,280
Well, what's the big deal, monitor?

441
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,550
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

442
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,550
Besides,

443
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,710
it's not in the law firm.

444
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,840
Why do you still take his side?

445
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,520
Give it to me.

446
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:04,790
Well,

447
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,320

No.

449

Don't take the bottle.

450
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,520
You don't need it.

451
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,080
Help, guys.

452
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,880
Take him away.

453
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
- I don't who's this boy.
- You want to get physical?

454
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,710
Give it to me.

455
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,710
Did you just hit me?

456
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,030

Well,

468
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,150
to be honest,

469
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,670
apparently my wishes

470
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,670
are reasonable and legitimate.

471
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,790
What's so hard to realize them?

472
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,590
Okay.

473
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,880
It's okay that they can't be realized.

474
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,200
But why does every wish go against me?

475
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,640
It's not right.

476
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,910
Now I don't even have a job.

477
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,840

00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,470

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,230
How's Uncle Mo?

573
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
Is his business doing well?

574
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,070
Pretty good.

575
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
Hey, stop filming.

576
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,160
Stop, stop it.

577
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,040
(At that time,

578
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,760
(someone took photos)

579
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,950
(of Mo Zixin)

580
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,430
(Shocking! Wet show of beauty on campus!)
(and posted them on the Internet.)

581
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,520
(Shocking! Wet show of beauty on campus!)
(After that,)

582
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,950
(Mo Zixin was often gossiped)

583
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,640
(by some ill-intentioned students.)

584
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,110
(That's her.)

585
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,640
How's Uncle Mo?

586
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
Is his business

587
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,950
doing well?

588
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:52,920
Yes.

589
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,280
Pretty good.

590
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
Lu Xun,

591
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,430
are you okay?

592
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,350
Hello?

593
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,830
Is there something wrong

594
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,400
with your brain?

595
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,710
Um.

596
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,230
It's a misunderstanding.

597
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,800
It's really a misunderstanding.

598
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
I just thought

599
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,470
that…

600
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,310
You know, this faucet…

601
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,950
Then why did you push me to the ground?

602
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,070
Are you a lunatic?

603
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,560
You made signs to me

604
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,710
in the examination room.

605
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,160
Of course I would report you.

606
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,680
Did you have to retaliate
against me like this?

607
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,950
Well,

608
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,430
he's not my boss now

609
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,070
Why should I put up with him?

610
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,880
This is the year 2011.

611
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
He's still a younger brother.

612
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,560
Hey, you!

613
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,070
Don't be so narcissistic.

614
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,950
It's just a college-opening exam.

615
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,280
Did I need to cheat?

616
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,230
Besides,

617
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,710
I'm telling you.

618
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,000
It is a sure thing

619
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that for this college-opening exam,

620
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,520
I,

621
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,230
will take the first place.

622
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:49,800
Do you hear me?

623
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,350
Who is this person?

624
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,710
Why is she so arrogant?

625
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,400
Right.

626
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,000
How dare she say that

627
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,920
in front of Lu Xun?

628
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
Well, my classmate.

629
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,590
What.

630
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,640
You don't believe it?

631
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,640
For the exam,

632
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,190
the criminal law you cited
in the last subjective question

633
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,190
has been amended.

634
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,710
The 8th amendment to Criminal Law

635
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,430
has come into effect

636
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,640
on May 1, 2011.

637
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,190
That means

638
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,000
you are wrong about that question.

639
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,070
Two points lost.

640
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,310
And, don't call me classmate.

641
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,350
I'm your elder sister.

642
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,830
I can also make a prediction.

643
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,640
From now on,

644
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,590
you will lose to me

645
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,470
in every examination,

646
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,160
every competition,

647
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,560
and every community activity.

648
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,520
This time, it's your turn

649
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,040
to be the forever No.2.

650
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Say whatever you like.

651
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,830
Don't put your hands on me.

652
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,590
I don't care.

653
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,880
Then I'll also make a prediction.

654
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,110
You'll be scolded very soon.

655
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,190
Have a guess.

656
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,070
Is my prediction correct?

657
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,230
Not everyone is a prophet.

658
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,590
Qian Wei.

659
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
The disturber of examination discipline.

660
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,040
You want to escape?

661
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,920
Come to my office.

662
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,680
Wei.

663
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,430
(From Dad)

664
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,680
(From Dad)
(Why did you hit the teacher)

665
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
(the first day in college?)

666
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,230
(Mr. Zhen called)

667
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,830
(and asked whether you were)

668
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,800
mentally deranged.)

669
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,310
(Apologize to the teacher now.)

670
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,230
(Don't get punished by the school.)

671
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,160
2011

672
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,110
Right.

673
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,160
Dad is still alive.

674
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,280
Well, sir.

675
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,040
There's something urgent at home.

676
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Can I go home first?

677
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,190
I'll come back to you very soon.

678
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
Is it that urgent?

679
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,110
Fine.

680
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,400
Then you don't need to come.

681
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,590
You'll receive
a disciplinary warning next week.

682
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,880
Isn't a nine o'clock curfew too early?

683
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,880
In the future,

684
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,040
this is just the beginning

685
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
of nightlife.

686
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,430
This door still remains unrepaired.

687
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:44,950
Tonight,

688
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,230
I will take Qian Yanping

689
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,950
to go to hospital.

690
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,710
I'll get him cured first.

691
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,000
Then I'll turn the tables.

692
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,470
It's so late.

693
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,470
Why are you going out?

694
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,280
You!

695
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,590
What are you doing?

696
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,680
Are you all right?

697
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,000
Well,

698
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,190
I'm not

699
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,230
trying to get out.

700
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,310
It's just that…

701
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,590
I… I want to…

702
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,800
Are you hungry?

703
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,920
It's okay.

704
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
I also plan to go out for some food.

705
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,760
Let's go together.

706
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,590
How about this?

707
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,560
You come down first.

708
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,520
I'll go up

709
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,430
and then pull you up.

710
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,590
Come on.

711
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,590
Well, it doesn't

712
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,710
feel right.

713
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,310
Actually, I…

714
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,070
Don't worry.

715
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,640
It's not like I must get out.

716
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,430
Don't be afraid.

717
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,280
I am also a student.

718
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm from Grade 2010, law department.

719
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,680
My name is Li Chongwen.

720
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,400
My name is Qian Wei.

721
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,560
- Why are you doing this?
- Please wait.

722
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
Why do you haunt me?

723
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,470
Let go of me.

724
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,000
Go away.

725
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,040
You are annoying.

726
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,470
You…

727
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,400
Do you know me?

728
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,470
I don't

729
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,190
I don't want to know you

730
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,070
in the past, now and in the future.

731
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,880
Stay away from me.

732
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,920
You were trying

733
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,350
to climb the wall just now.

734
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,280
I just want to give you a hand.

735
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
I won't take advantage of you.

736
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,800
Stop it.

737
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,880
Stay away from me!

738
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,950
Give me a hand? I don't need it.

739
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,950
If you enjoy helping others so much,

740
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,000
you can be Aquaman.

741
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,560
Then you'd better study

742
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
in the ocean department.

743
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,280
Law department is not right for you.

744
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,590
Aqua… Aquaman?

745
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,880
I can't swim.

746
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,070
What? Who's Aquaman?

747
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,880
You don't need to know.

748
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,470
Go away.

749
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,350
Stay away from me.

750
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,950
What are you doing again?

751
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,470
Qian Wei.

752
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,110
You,

753
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,880
cheated in the exam,

754
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,070
hit your senior

755
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,350
and climbed the wall to get out.

756
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,560
What do you want?

757
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,400
You broke more school rules in a day

758
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,110
than others break in a year.

759
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,070
Do you have to get yourself

760
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,070
a disciplinary measure?

761
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,760
Don't give me that look.

762
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,470
Resentment?

763
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,190
Are you all right, Senior Li?

764
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,520
It's okay.

765
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,430
In the future, you will have

766
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,400
a tit-for-tat fight.

767
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
The scene of you two getting along

768
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,280
makes me feel uncomfortable.

769
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,470
We were studying how to climb the walls.

770
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,680
Somehow,

771
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,710
she suddenly got upset.

772
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,520
You got it wrong.

773
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,190
He didn't get it wrong.

774
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,310
I was hitting you.

775
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,190
And afterwards,

776
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,520
if you get close to me again,

777
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,070
I will…

778
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,000
Go to eat something.

779
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,680
Your stomach keeps rumbling.

780
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,880
I'll hit you every time I see you.

781
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Don't laugh. I mean it.

782
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,710
You're threatening him,

783
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,800
my classmate.

784
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,880
In serious cases, you'll get detained.

785
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,520
Do you want to live here

786
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,880
or go to the police station

787
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,160
for tonight?

788
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,110
Who are you?

789
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,230
It's none of your business.

790
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,160
The teacher made me be acting monitor.

791
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,710
So many things happened
on the first day.

792
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,160
Where's the face

793
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,230
of Law Department 2011?

794
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,070
It's all because of you.

795
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,400
Acting monitor. Wow, you are so great!

796
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,070
Do you think you are my boss?

797
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,400
As for Law Department 2011,

798
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,310
I have plenty of time

799
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,880
to gain glory for it.

800
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,760
Don't you worry about it!

801
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,430
Goodbye.

802
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,000
Come back.

803
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,070
What!

804
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,560
Look at yourself.

805
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,920
You are just fooling around.

806
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,590
You'd spend tonight

807
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,430
safe and sound first.

808
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,040
Take it.

809
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,350
Why should I take it for you?

810
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,000
Come on.

811
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,040
Be a good girl. Take it.

812
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:25,710
I won't take it for you.

813
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,470
Take it.

814
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,880
Go!

815
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,400
Well,

816
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,040
I need to get out.

817
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,880
It's urgent.

818
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,560
Stop talking.

819
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,430
I have an emergency.

820
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,350
Can I…

821
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,000
Let me get out.

822
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,680
I'm come back soon.

823
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,640
No way.

824
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
Don't tug at my clothes.

825
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,400
I'm talking to you.

826
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,430
Are you a kangaroo?

827
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,920
Don't jump around.

828
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,680
Well, take your thing.

829
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,160
I'll go myself.

830
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,310
Take the bag yourself.

831
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,950
Well.

832
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,430
Qian Wei, wait. Stop!

833
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,830
Help! Don't chase me.

834
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,800
Qian Wei.

835
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,760
Qian Wei.

836
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,000
It's our first time to be roommates.

837
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,350
You don't need to be so nice.

838
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,880
Qian Wei,

839
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,560
you also don't need to be so impulsive.

840
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,830
Done.

841
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,230
I,

842
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,920
am very satisfied

843
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,680
with this hairstyle.

844
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,350
It does look good.

845
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,230
You two

846
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,110
are like Iron Man,

847
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,760
aren't you?

848
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
You equipped our dormitory

849
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,680
with water dispenser

850
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,830
and refrigerator.

851
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,560
To be honest,

852
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm not as rich as you are,

853
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,830
but I have some experience.

854
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,710
For girls studying law like us,

855
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,640
baldness is a common problem.

856
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,520
If we directly

857
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,190
tie our hair up,

858
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,560
it's easier for us to get bald.

859
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,640
Therefore, this bangs

860
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,190
and these hair-growing products

861
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,950
are my best wishes

862
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,430
to your Lisa,

863
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,470
Linda and Amanda.

864
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,760
Lisa, Linda, Amanda?

865
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,710
Who are they?

866
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,800
Sweet,

867
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,110
each hair

868
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,880
of each bald girl

869
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,230
deserves a name.

870
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,280
You'll understand ten years later.

871
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,590
Come on.

872
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,430
Stop your bullshit.

873
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,400
Ten years?

874
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,470
I don't buy it.

875
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,590
You don't believe me, right?

876
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,590
It's time to show you

877
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,920
my status and superpower.

878
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,280
In your fridge

879
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,920
is all beers.

880
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,470
How do you know it?

881
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,280
At that time,

882
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,110
I was conquered

883
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,190
by Big Sister Liu

884
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,160
with this fridge of beers.

885
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,230
I have two more suggestions.

886
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,590
Don't hide the fridge

887
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,400
under the table.

888
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Otherwise,

889
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,430
Aunt Ma will confiscate it

890
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,160
as an illegal appliance
the day after tomorrow

891
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,430
I know.

892
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,430
You'll say you can buy it again.

893
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,430
Am I right?

894
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,160
What a waste of these beers!

895
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,470
Isn't it?

896
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,590
You can't squander money like that.

897
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,280
One more thing,

898
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
an underwear stealer

899
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,310
will frequent here recently.

900
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,040
So you must put your underwear

901
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,950
and precious things

902
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,520
in a safe place.

903
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,070
Do you understand?

904
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,230
Okay.

905
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,430
You make me jumpy.

906
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,920
Since they'll be gone

907
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,520
the day after tomorrow,

908
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,560
let's drink them all today.

909
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,310
Um, drink now?

910
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,000
Drink.

911
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,800
Zixin, can you drink beers?

912
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,430
Of course.

913
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,640
A friends with status?

914
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,760
That's rare.

915
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,040
I,

916
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
decide to befriend with you.

917
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,470
To our pretty hair!

918
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,800
To our youth!

919
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,040
To turn the tables!

920
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,350
To get rich!

921
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
What do you mean by turning the tables?

922
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,830
It means that we can have

923
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,880
whatever we want and a cool life.

924
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,950
Turn the tables?

925
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,280
Right.

926
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,350
To turn the tables!

927
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,280
To turn the tables!

928
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,190
Come on. Cheers!

00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,880
I miss you so much.

955
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,470
This child

956
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,590
(Opening Ceremony)
Wei, come down.

957
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,880
(Opening Ceremony)
No, I want to hug him.

958
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,160
Your father

959
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,680
can't hold your weight.

960
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,430
Let me carry her for a while.

961
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,040
How nice it is!

962
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,160
Stop showing off.

963
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,040
It's okay, girl.

964
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,190
It's so nice to have a daughter.

965
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,070
You miss Dad, right?

966
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,350
Stay on my back.

967
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,950
No worries.

968
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,800
I can carry you for long.

969
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,470
I'm a little trembling.

970
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,470
But it's not my legs.

971
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,470
It's because of the music.

972
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,430
Come down.

973
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
All right. It's okay.

974
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,520
You are better than Qian Chuan.

975
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,920
That boy.

976
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,310
He didn't even show up to welcome me.

977
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,640
Are you OK?

978
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,060
(2011 Opening Ceremony
of Guanghua University)

979
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,470
Slow down.

980
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,230
Be careful.

981
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,000
Thank you

982
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,600
Li Peng.

983
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,280
Be careful.

984
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,080
Watch the steps.

985
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,000
Watch out.

986
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,150
Ten minutes left.

987
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,190
Is everyone here?

988
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,150
They'll come.

989
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,620
(2011 Opening Ceremony
of Guanghua University)

990
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,630
Where is Qian Wei again?

991
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:32,910
By the way,

992
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
I bought a gift

993
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,560
for entering college.

994
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,600
The tour guide

995
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,760
recommended this to me

996
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,520
when I was traveling in Tibet.

997
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,840
And it cost me a lot.

998
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,000
The guide said

999
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,080
that you can reverse the situation

1000
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,560
when you're at a low point

1001
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,150
in your life

1002
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
by twisting this little wheel.

1003
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,760
How did you know that?

1004
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,230
That's what he said.

1005
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,560
You were ripped off again.

1006
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,430
And don't keep saying things

1007
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,870
like avoiding the low point of life.

1008
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,630
Do you know Murphy's Law?

1009
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,950
You don't want something to happen,

1010
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,520
but it will still happen.

1011
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,000
Besides,

1012
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,670
I think

1013
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,150
my life is very good now.

1014
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,000
There's nothing I want to change.

1015
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,630
No, don't.

1016
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't throw it.

1017
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,360
Who's Murphy?

1018
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,040
I don't know him.

1019
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,230
Why should I trust him?

1020
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,390
Look,

1021
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,670
you will know

1022
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,190
how important this little thing is

1023
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,710
when the time comes.

1024
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,910
You can ask me for it

1025
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,670
when you need it.

1026
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,630
But for my fat thumb

1027
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,230
which can't wear it,

1028
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,630
I wouldn't have given it to you.

1029
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,470
I'll keep it for now.

1030
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,910
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Qian,

1031
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,150
there are just five minutes

1032
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,000
before the ceremony starts.

1033
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,230
How about
taking your seats inside first?

1034
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

1035
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,800
No, no, no.

1036
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
We'll go to hospital first.

1037
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,910
Go to hospital?

1038
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,080
It's you.

1039
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,840
Not me.

1040
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,000
What about me?

1041
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,390
Last night, I dreamed

1042
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,710
that you had acute leukemia.

1043
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,080
So now I must take you

1044
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,470
to hospital for a checkup.

1045
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,360
What do you mean?

1046
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,360
What's the matter with you?

1047
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,470
What disease do I have?

1048
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,630
You don't believe me, right?

1049
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,230
Let me tell you,

1050
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,390
I also dreamed

1051
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,080
that you hid your private money

1052
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
in your long johns.

1053
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,190
And Mom's birthday present this year

1054
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,150
is hidden in…

1055
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,280
No, stop.

1056
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,360
I'll take her to hospital.

1057
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,840
This kid is ill.

1058
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,360
Wait.

1059
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,040
Mr. Qian.

1060
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,870
Only five minutes left.

1061
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,710
It's okay to have dreams.

1062
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,840
But could you dream after the ceremony?

1063
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,150
No.

1064
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,430
The ceremony is just a formality.

1065
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,950
It's not important.

1066
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,840
My thing is urgent.

1067
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,040
I've promised the head teacher

1068
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,430
to hold the ceremony well.

1069
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,520
I must keep my promise.

1070
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,840
My mother is a doctor.

1071
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,840
If

1072
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
you need it,

1073
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll let her…

1074
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,630
It's you who promised the head teacher.

1075
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,390
I have nothing to do with it.

1076
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:30,870
Go.

1077
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,390
Let's go.

1078
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,120
No, no.

1079
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,230
We should go now.

1080
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,760
You must go to hospital now.

1081
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,360
Hey, you!

1082
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,420
(Welcome 2011 freshmen!)

1083
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,020
(Outpatient Department)

1084
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,670
See? There's no big problem.

1085
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,360
Don't be afraid.

1086
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,120
But this indicator is a little high.

1087
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,080
Have some grapes.

1088
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,390
The Greek grape growers
grow Greek grapes.

1089
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,000
Good.

1090
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,230
So sour.

1091
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,800
It's not.

1092
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,710
Your Uncle Wang from next door

1093
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,190
said that his daughter

1094
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,120
brought him a box of

1095
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,670
cherries.

1096
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,430
American cherries.

1097
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,150
Cherries

1098
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,150
from America.

1099
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,470
And?

1100
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,000
He said that it was very sweet.

1101
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,150
I said I wanted to try one.

1102
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,080
He refused to give me any.

1103
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,390
What a stingy man!

1104
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,280
But his daughter is so great!

1105
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,670
If you want some, just say it.

1106
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,190
No need to speak in riddles.

1107
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,360
No, I'm not.

1108
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,280
I'll take the grapes away.

1109
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,470
Hello.

1110
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,120
(Cherry)
Is this 386 yuan per kg?

1111
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,710
Yes.

1112
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,190
That's "cheap".

1113
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,320
Dad doesn't want to eat this.

1114
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,000
Dad doesn't want to eat this.

1115
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,360
He can have tomatoes.

1116
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,080
Isn't it just 200 yuan?

1117
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,190
Why was I being such a cheapskate then?

1118
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,040
Before his death,

1119
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,520
Dad had never eaten cherries.

1120
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,280
Are you okay?

1121
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm not.

1122
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,670
Can you lend me 500 yuan?

1123
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,390
What? Five hundred?

1124
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,280
I don't have 500 yuan.

1125
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,190
I don't have that much money.

1126
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,800
Your mom

1127
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,760
will come back

1128
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,000
in a while.

1129
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,760
You can ask her.

1130
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,560
I can't.

1131
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,390
If I ask her for money,

1132
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,190
she will ask

1133
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,080
what's the use for it.

1134
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,190
You borrow from me

1135
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,560
and I will also ask you about its use.

1136
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
It's clearly better to borrow from you.

1137
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,600
Can you lend me some?

1138
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,320
Come on.

1139
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,390
I really don't have that much money.

1140
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,120
Stop it.

1141
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,190
We just met a few days ago.

1142
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,600
Do I know you well?

1143
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,190
It's okay.

1144
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,000
We were strangers yesterday.

1145
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,760
We are acquaintances today.

1146
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,000
If you lend me the money,

1147
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,150
we'll become good friends.

1148
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,120
No way.

1149
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,430
I don't want a friend

1150
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,470
like you.

1151
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,390
I really don't have money.

1152
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,670
Come on.

1153
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,150
Don't be like this.

1154
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,150
I really need the money.

1155
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,840
- I'll use it for a good purpose.
- No.

1156
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Look,

1157
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,470
don't put your hands on me.

1158
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,390
This is my money.

1159
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,470
Besides,

1160
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,710
it's okay that your parents

1161
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,230
see you touching me.

1162
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,280
But if my mom sees it,

1163
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,670
what will she think of me?

1164
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,950
Do you really refuse to lend it to me?

1165
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Okay.

1166
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,360
If you don't lend me the money,

1167
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm really not sure

1168
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,000
what your mother

1169
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,600
will think of you.

1170
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,760
I don't understand

1171
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,390
what you just said.

1172
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,760
I don't have that much money.

1173
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,390
All I have…

1174
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,040
Mr. Lu Xun, lend me some money.

1175
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,800
Please.

1176
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,280
Thank you.

1177
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,280
My living allowance.

1178
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,950
500, just 500.

1179
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,470
If we really live to that age,

1180
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,390
how happy we'll be!

1181
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,910
Right.

1182
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,600
How's it going?

1183
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,320
Wei,

1184
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,670
guess what the doctor said?

1185
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,950
Anything wrong?

1186
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,280
Nothing wrong.

1187
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,840
That's nice.

1188
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,910
Early checkup is useful.

1189
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,390
Dad, this is for you.

1190
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,320
Cherries imported from America.

1191
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,390
Oh, dear.

1192
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,710
Eat as much as you want.

1193
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,760
Others have it.

1194
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,360
You can also have it.

1195
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,710
Good.

1196
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,520
So expensive?

1197
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,470
(American Cherry)

1198
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,000
Wei,

1199
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,360
several boxes of this can cost

1200
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,760
your monthly living allowances.

1201
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,080
Well, money doesn't matter.

1202
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,560
What matters is that you are happy.

1203
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:33,800
Right?

1204
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,190
Yes, right.

1205
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,120
Dad,

1206
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,800
one more thing.

1207
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,910
Could you quit the job

1208
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,320
in that parts processing factory?

1209
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,150
That workplace is so filthy.

1210
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,150
And it's such a closed environment.

1211
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,190
There must be

1212
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,950
excessive chemicals inside.

1213
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,520
It can lead to blood disease easily.

1214
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,950
You've already reached

1215
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,910
the age of retirement.

1216
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,760
Just retire early.

1217
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,280
How can I retire?

1218
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,150
The company needs me.

1219
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,630
Will the factory close down
if you retire?

1220
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,150
Wei is right.

1221
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,470
No one is as busy as you

1222
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,360
at this age.

1223
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,630
I want you to retire.

1224
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,840
All right.

1225
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,760
You're the boss.

1226
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,600
I'll take your mother to dinner.

1227
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,600
Let's celebrate.

1228
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,560
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Qian.

1229
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,600
Goodbye.

1230
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,600
We can have

1231
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,390
Bread Soaked in Fish Head Soup.

1232
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,190
Lu Xun.

1233
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,320
Thank you for today.

1234
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,670
You let my father do a full examination

1235
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,230
and lent me the money.

1236
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,040
I'll buy you dinner

1237
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,190
Do you like hot-spicy pot,

1238
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,600
spicy hot pot, or what?

1239
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,080
Both okay.

1240
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,760
It's up to you.

1241
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,040
I,

1242
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,150
don't want food.

1243
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,710
I want the money.

1244
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,360
And,

1245
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
what's the cherry that you bought?

1246
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,840
Five hundred yuan

1247
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,360
for just two boxes.

1248
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,000
It's not ordinary cheery.

1249
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,520
It's imported from America.

1250
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,320
What's more,

1251
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,150
don't be so narrow-mined.

1252
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,870
It's just some money.

1253
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,120
I'll return it to you.

1254
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,630
I really want to get on well with you

1255
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,670
for the next four years.

1256
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,280
During the four years,

1257
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,670
how much money will you owe me?

1258
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,670
I already regret

1259
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,470
wasting so much time

1260
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,600
with you.

1261
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,470
And can you stop interrupting me

1262
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,150
when I'm not finished yet?

1263
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,950
If you

1264
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,390
want to be a troublesome girl,

1265
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,560
no problem

1266
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,280
But don't get others involved,

1267
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,430
especially me.

1268
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,320
Do you understand?

1269
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,560
Yes.

1270
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,520
No matter in 2022

1271
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,600
or in 2011,

1272
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,520
this person

1273
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,280
is just equally annoying.
