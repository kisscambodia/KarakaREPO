(this evil and ruthless
rich spoilt brat,)

(is Ling Yao...)

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,320
(but currently, I)

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,200
(should have been pursuing my dream)

24
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,920

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,160
I'll remember to charge it

28
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,040
or I'll...

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,240
I'll jump off.

30
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,920
Go ahead.

31
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,200
I think that's unnecessary.

32
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,000
We're going to be late anyway.

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,160
My dream is dashed.

34
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,640
I might as well jump off with you.

35
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,480
I remember a shortcut.

36
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Let's go.

37
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,680
Hurry up.

38
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,720
Jump. What are you
waiting for? Go down.

39
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,040
Are you going to hand over
the photos you took secretly?

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
I've truly deleted those photos.

41
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,560
Do you have another
copy in the computer?

42
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,920
I'll give you another chance
before we call the cops.

43
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,840
He's so cute.

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,640
It's not the time for that.

45
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,280
Film it.

46
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,920
What are you doing?

47
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
Stop what you're doing.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,280
I'm seeking justice, okay?

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,720
Stay out of it.

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,680
Momo.

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,760
I think there's a misunderstanding.

52
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,680
Let's go.

53
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,440
I'll count to three.

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
If you don't hand it over,

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,040
I'll make you do it.

56
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,440
Three.

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,560
Don't be scared.

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,680
I'll surely help you.

59
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,960
Two.

60
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,880
One.

61
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,480
What are you waiting for?

62
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,200
Run.

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,040
Yao, here!

64
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,720
Yao.

65
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,600
It's all Ling Yao's fault

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
that we were late

67
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,160
and asked to write reports for it.

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
We can't let it slide.

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,040
(Shocking! A Bully in University)
Of course not.

70
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,880
(Let's see whether you
will bully anyone again.)

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,480
Yao.

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,880
A bully at university?

73
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,960
Nonsense.

74
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,760
No.

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,120
I'll reason with her.

76
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,080
How dare she smear Yao's name.

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
We were seeking justice, okay?

78
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,200
Forget it.

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,640
Let it slide.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
People are jealous when I'm popular.

81
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
(Mr. Ling, the chairman)

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,680
Ling Yao!

83
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,080
What are you doing?

84
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,480
Why aren't you speaking?

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,520
Hello?

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Is it about money again this time?

87
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,120
Do you know how the share price
has dropped because of you?

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
It's indeed about money.

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,120
So what if it is?

90
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,240
Have you ever earned money?

91
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
You're relying on the family.

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Since you care so much about Ling Group

93
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,840
and your money,

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,920
fine,

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,840
I won't get money from you anymore.

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,560
You...

97
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,360
Listen.

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Watch out.

99
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,800
I heard that a junior

100
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,880
criticised Ling Yao
in the school's forum.

101
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,680
Guess what?

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,160
The equipment he used
exploded in chemistry class.

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
When he's watching a movie,

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,000
he's buried with popcorn for no reason.

105
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,200
Also,

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,360
when he's playing ping-pong,

107
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,800
the pitching machine
was spoilt suddenly.

108
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,160
It's tragic.

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,520
These are just rumours.

110
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,480
Just watch out.

111
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,760
Come on.

112
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,320
Let's enter the class.

113
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Come on.

114
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,439
(Drawing Room)

115
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,399
It's Tang Momo.

116
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,480
Go back to our seats.

117
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,800
Han Xiao'ai.

118
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,920
(I'll infiltrate
the enemy's camp first.)

119
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,480
(I'll keep you posted.)

120
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,680
(I'm with you.)

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,000
(Ling Yao is not that kind of a person.)

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,080
(It must be a misunderstanding.)

123
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,320
(This is a conspiracy.)

124
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,520
(People are actually
defending Ling Yao.)

125
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,440
(Who did it?)

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
Tang Momo.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,520
How dare you frame Yao.

128
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,440
This is just the beginning.

129
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,000
- Give it to me.
- Here.

130
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,319
Watch out!

131
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,400
Come on!

132
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,400
(Ling Yao.)

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,960
(He is still playing basketball
as if nothing has happened.)

134
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
That guy is so cute.

135
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Tang Momo?

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,880
How dare you look for me.

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,480
Why wouldn't I?

138
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm not the guilty one.

139
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm not either.

140
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,160
Are you sure?

141
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,040
Would you dare to
say you didn't bully Gu Chi

142
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,760
and get someone to pour
instant noodles on me?

143
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,320
I...

144
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,520
You can't defend yourself, right?

145
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,880
Ling Yao.

146
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm telling you.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,240
Just target me all you want.

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm not a coward.

149
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,520
Watch out!

150
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,760
Ling Yao!

151
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,800
You're doomed!

152
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Momo.

153
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
I know how they'll prank you.

154
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,440
They said in the group chat that

155
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
they'd smack you with water balls.

156
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,680
They're too much.

157
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,920
They won't succeed.

158
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,880
What are you going to do?

159
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,680
(If you want proof of your innocence,)

160
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,480
(see you at the school's
courtyard at 2pm on Friday.)

161
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I'll strike back.

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
(Since they will smack
me with water balls,)

163
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,520
(I'll let them get a taste
of their own medicine.)

164
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
(I'll trick Ling Yao into going there)

165
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,400
(so that he'll be smacked
by water balls instead.)

166
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,199
(Let's act according to the plan.)

167
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,000
(Got it.)

168
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,920
Put more water in it.

169
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,240
Hurry up.

170
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,440
Make each bigger.

171
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,520
Tang Momo.

172
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
Hurry up.

173
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,080
Squat down here, you two.

174
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,200
Don't expose yourselves.

175
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,400
Squat down here, you two.

176
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
(Are you ready?)

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
(Everything is going as planned.)

178
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
(Ling Yao, you can never escape.)

179
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,240
Where's the proof?
