(Momo suffers)

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,600
At that time,

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,040
her face

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,960
was just 0.01cm from mine,

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,440
but about 7 minutes later,

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
she'd fall head over heels for me

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,120
and

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
give me a passionate kiss.

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,000
Can you do it?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,880
You're so heavy.

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,520
Yao.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,520
Your hand...

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,680
Is it okay for you to play the match?

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,360
No problem.

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,240
Yao.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,440
You're impressive

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,280
for saving the beauty yesterday.

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,160
When did you fall for her?

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,440
Don't tell me

28
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,400
you fell for her instead
of resenting her.

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,840
Would I fall for her?

30
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,440
You would.

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,360
You even...

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,160
did this to her.

33
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,520
I'll rest now.

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,320
So early?

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,120
No need. Thanks.

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,320
Yao.

37
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,520
There are rumours of you

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,960
and Tang Momo all over the school.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,160
Would you clarify it?

40
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,120
What's there to clarify?

41
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,160
There's no need for that.

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,240
Tang Momo is being too much

43
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
for pestering you.

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,520
We should've been more ruthless to her.

45
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,800
Didn't the school punish
you enough for that?

46
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,160
Miss.

47
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,960
If not for Yao,

48
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,600
you would've been
scolded by the teacher.

49
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,160
You're so pretty.

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,080
If you have nothing to do,

51
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,800
just study.

52
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,160
Who do they think they are?

53
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Come on.

54
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,280
Feifei.

55
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,840
Don't be mad.

56
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,960
You and Ling Yao are childhood friends.

57
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,240
Tang Momo is a nobody.

58
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,080
Tang Momo is just a clown.

59
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,040
That's right.

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,400
Just let it slide.

61
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,840
Of course not.

62
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,680
At this moment,

63
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,440
you must show your authority.

64
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,720
Don't let that bad and scheming girl

65
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,000
defeat you with her tactics.

66
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,040
Look at you two.

67
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,240
You're compatible.

68
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,320
However, the progress

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,880
is a little too soon.

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,480
Next time,

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
will you

72
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,760
do what the adults do?

73
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,080
Han Xiao'ai.

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,600
Delete it right now.

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
Or I'll beat you up.

76
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,640
Calm down.

77
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,640
Ling Yao

78
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,760
is rather good-looking.

79
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
A kiss is nothing.

80
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,600
I don't care about him.

81
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,520
Tang Momo.

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
You're shameless!

83
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,560
Yes.

84
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,520
You're shameless.

85
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,120
That's right.

86
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
He has never kissed Feifei before.

87
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,600
Shut up.

88
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
Stay away from Yao.

89
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
You're like

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
a fly buzzing around.

91
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,920
I don't care at all.

92
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,160
Return it to me.

93
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,960
Yao is mine.

94
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Don't you even think about it.

95
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,560
Don't even think of leaving

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
after what you've done.

97
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,680
Tang Momo. You...

98
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,920
Tang Momo, you...

99
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
What are you doing?

100
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Han Xiao'ai!

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,480
Momo.

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,880
There's a week to go

103
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,320
before registration ends.

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
Can you complete your design?

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,480
I have no choice but to finish it.

106
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,440
I must enter it this year.

107
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Yes.

108
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
Entering MUA

109
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,600
is akin to qualifying
for Crabapple Award.

110
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,000
You can't afford to miss it.

111
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,800
How can I help you?

112
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,480
Just

113
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
complete the 10,000-word report
assigned by the teacher.

114
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,040
It's you.

115
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,560
I thought someone was stalking me.

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,240
It's me.

117
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,760
Don't be afraid.

118
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,600
Why are you here at this hour?

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
It's because you're here.

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,480
Were you looking for me?

121
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,440
What is it?

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
There's something.

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
It's important.

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
What do you want?

125
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,160
I like you.

126
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,520
Look.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,680
Look.

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,480
Look.

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
I've been by your side.

130
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,440
You like me, too, right?

131
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,040
You came all the way to save me.

132
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,120
You even

133
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
-offended Ling Yao for me.
- No.

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,720
I don't.

135
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,800
You're playing hard to get.

136
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,320
Women are like that.

137
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,800
So is Xiaoya.

138
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,400
If Ling Yao wasn't being nosy,

139
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
she'd have been mine.

140
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,680
Don't be scared.

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,600
Very soon,

142
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,880
