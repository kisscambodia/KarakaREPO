(Meet by chance)

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,560
You're up.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
What is this?

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,320
"This is my Crabapple Award.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,960
Don't touch it."

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
This is your beloved Crabapple Award.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,480
Momo.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,000
Come on.

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,840

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
I have a speech for the award.

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,480
Momo.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,160
Listen to me.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,440
Listen to me.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,080
Thank you for presenting Crabapple Award

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,480
to me.

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,200
It's been my goal all along.

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,880
I want to thank my father.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,240
I want to thank my mother.

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,400
-I want to thank my hometown fellows
-Come down.

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,280
for educating me.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,600
Come down.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
Thank you.

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,120
Also,

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I want to thank my best friend.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,600
Han Xiao'ai.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Let's go.

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,360
-No. No.
-Let's go.

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
One more thing.

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
The last one.

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,320
On this day of national celebration,

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I want to present a song.

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,800
"Tonight Is Unforgettable".

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,640
Let's go. Okay?

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,520
Let me sing.

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,160
♪Tonight♪

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,760
You sing.

♪Is unforgettable♪

00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,560
♪Tonight is Unforgettable♪

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,760
-Don't snatch it.
-Come on. Let's go.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,000
This is my trophy.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
My trophy.

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,480
See you.

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,800
This is embarrassing.

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,320
Xiao'ai.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,360
Momo.

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,480
Is this necessary?

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,080
Don't call my name.

57
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,240
I suppose I won't
be recognised like this.

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm troubled

59
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
by the exam.

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,040
Tang Momo!

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,759
I'm coming.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,120
Are you kidding me?

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,080
What happened?

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,880
Why has she become

65
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,680
like this after one night?

66
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,760
Yao.

67
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Did you do something to her?

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,880
Why did she turn around
as soon as she saw you?

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Is it because of you?

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
Did you upset her?

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,960
Have you gotten an idea

72
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
for starting a business?

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,280
We're gossiping.

74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Don't get serious.

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
You want to gossip, right?

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,320
I heard that

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
a few days ago,

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,800
you went to be the model once again

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
for Han Xiao'ai's drawing class.

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,320
You and Han Xiao'ai...

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
Get serious.

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
What matters the most
for starting a business?

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,040
People,

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
money

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,240
and creativity.

86
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,720
But we have neither money nor people.

87
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,000
Not even creativity.

88
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,480
How to get started?

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,760
I can

90
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
get the money.

91
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,960
As the president
of the computer club in school,

92
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,360
I have some fans.

93
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,120
Therefore,

94
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,760
I can

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,040
find people.

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,880
What about creativity?

97
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Creativity.

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
It matters the most

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,880
for starting a business.

100
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,280
Quality of creativity

101
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,960
determines the success
of entrepreneurship.

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,640
Creativity and entrepreneurship

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,040
are closely connected and inseparable.

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,920
Let's go.

105
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,240
Then we should...

106
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
I haven't finished talking.

107
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Why are you leaving?

108
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
What are you drawing?

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,080
You smile cheerfully.

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,480
Han Xiao'ai.

111
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,120
Could you be drawing
pubescent comic again?

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,040
Let me see.

113
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,360
Give it to me.

114
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,880
No.

115
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,080
No.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,120
So Hua is...

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,880
No.

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
It's just a casual drawing.

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Tang Momo.

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,960
Let's go.

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,480
They are here.

122
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,200
Let's go.

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,120
Xiao'ai.

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,360
In regard to application creativity,

125
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
I've done market research.

126
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,120
I suggest

127
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,920
a mobile application on fashion.

128
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,880
Fashion blogger?

129
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,920
You may take it like that.

130
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
But we'll do

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
an application that can smartly

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,440
provide dressing solutions to users.

133
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Users may upload pictures
of their own clothes

134
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
and make their personal wardrobe.

135
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
Provide different
dressing suggestions to users

136
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,200
based on different
occasions and ambience.

137
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,560
To make profits,

138
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
we may collaborate with some
fashion brands.

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,760
You may go through it.

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,360
We can't stay in the school anymore.

141
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,760
We meet too often.

142
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
It's said
that if we meet by chance

143
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,120
thrice a day,

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
that's our fateful encounter.

145
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,520
Don't believe in superstition.

146
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,160
Why don't we

147
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,800
go and buy some materials?

148
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,880
All of the sudden?

149
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,480
We can't fall in love.

150
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,720
We should build our career.

151
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,600
Let's go.

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,840
What's the matter?

153
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
Ling Yao?

154
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,400
Thrice.

155
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,920
Further back.

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
More.

157
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,080
Okay.

158
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,720
There.

159
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,760
How do you get a permit

160
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,720
to take photos in this coffee shop?

161
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
Qian Duoduo of the class next door

162
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
is working here as a part-timer.

163
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,480
I asked for her help.

164
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
It's enough with these photos.

165
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,160
No.

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Change another pose.

167
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,640
Smile.

168
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,440
How should I pose it?

169
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,280
I don't know.

170
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,200
Cut the nonsense.

171
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,600
We have no money to hire a model.

172
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,560
This is our only way.

173
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Smile.

174
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,200
Put your hand down.

175
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,960
You should bend instead.

176
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,560
To the left.

177
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,040
This side?

178
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,480
Yes.

179
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,240
More.

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,920
More?

181
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,600
More.

182
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,960
Wait.

183
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,800
You...

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,080
Why are you here?

185
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,240
We meet by chance.

186
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560
Do me a favour.

187
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,000
Come with me.

188
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,080
So this is a fateful encounter.

189
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,880
Mr. Tan.

190
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Just like what I've said earlier,

191
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,760
our application

192
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,680
doesn't only invite fashion brands

193
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
but also

194
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
professional image stylist.

195
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,160
