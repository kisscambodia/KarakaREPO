This isn't the time for that.

The pattern looks nice.

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,640
It seems you have
a solid foundation.

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,760
The material selection is also perfect.

51
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,080

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,840
Why is green yarn used here?

55
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Why didn't you follow my design?

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,560
At this stage, all of you

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
just need to follow the rules.

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,680
Do not simply change my design.

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Yours is also not bad.

60
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
Pleated decoration at the waist

61
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,880
is quite unique.

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,320
However, this fabric

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,160
may not be the best option.

64
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,320
It lacks a supple quality.

65
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
It seems a little stiff.

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,880
I was in a hurry when
I was choosing the fabric.

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,840
Speaking of which,

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,560
I have to learn from Momo.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,600
I wonder if Momo's control of colour

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,640
is as accurate as that of fabric?

71
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,760
You...

72
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,440
What do you mean?

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,600
Among the colours of
these three pieces of fabric,

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
which one goes well with this?

75
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,760
Qiao Nuanfei, what
are you implying?

76
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,840
What's wrong?

77
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Can't you choose?

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,840
Are you unable to choose

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,840
or that you don't even know

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,760
what colours the three
pieces of fabric are?

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,640
Momo.

82
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,280
Yes.

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
I can't tell.

84
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,040
Momo.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Actually, I appreciate

86
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,200
some of your design concepts.

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,280
You said you wanted us

88
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
to explore a new world
of colours together.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
I believe you said these words

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,320
with sincerity.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,000
However,

92
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
you can't tell the colours apart.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
No matter how you explore,

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,920
there are some fatal difficulties

95
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
that we can't conquer.

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,800
Sir,

97
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,360
you saw the clothes.

98
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,800
Trust me.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,040
I can definitely handle the job.

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
Please give me a chance.

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,400
I will definitely work harder

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
to make up for this shortcoming.

103
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,680
It's not that I don't want
to give you a chance.

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
As you know,

105
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,760
my design

106
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,640
requires a good
understanding of colours.

107
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,440
With your situation,

108
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
you may not be suitable for my studio.

109
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
All right, sir.

110
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
Wait.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Do you remember? During the interview,

112
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,160
you said a friend told you

113
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,360
not to be bound by colours.

114
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
I also want to tell you

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,800
not to be constrained by colours.

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,640
Perhaps you will find

117
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,960
a whole new world of your own.

118
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
Although we can't work together,

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,920
I hope

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
we can still be friends.

121
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
Thank you, sir.

122
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,520

123
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,600

you as an opponent.

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,360
I didn't know that
you'd never beaten me.

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,080
I knew you'd be here.

126
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,400
Aren't you feeling cold?

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
Why can't I tell the
colours of Skittles?

128
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,520
Why can't I play Anipop?

129
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,280
It turns out I've lost from the start.

130
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,480
Actually, you should think this way.

131
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,960
As long as it is sweet,

132
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,720
the colours of Skittles

133
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,560
actually don't matter.

134
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
You can't play Anipop.
That is the problem of the game.

135
