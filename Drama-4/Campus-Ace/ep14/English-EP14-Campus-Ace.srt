00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,240
Hello, Qiao Nuanfei.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,960
Where are you?

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,480
Hello.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,360
Mr. Martin,

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,720
I'll be there soon.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,160
I'm in a traffic jam.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,960
Can you send someone to pick me up?

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,640
I may not be able to carry
all these things on my own.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,480
Miss.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,040
Do you think everyone else
has so much time as you do?

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,360
I can't find another intern right now

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,480
to pick you up.

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,000
If you can't even carry clothes,

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,480
how can you be a designer?

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,960
Let me tell you.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,480
If you don't arrive in 10 minutes,

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,720
you don't have to come tomorrow.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,400
Hurry.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
We'll go on stage in five minutes.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Hurry up, everyone.

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,760
Sir.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,480
I'll get off here.

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm transferring the money to you.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Do you need help?

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,280
If not,

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
I'll get going.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,600
I need help.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
Louder.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,560
I didn't hear you.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
I need help.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,640
Please help me.

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,840
Let's go.

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
Mr. Martin, ​​please take note.

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
Ask the models to
stand by in 10 minutes.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Mr. Martin, ​​please take note.

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,800
Ask the models to
stand by in 10 minutes.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
Qiao Nuanfei, you're finally here.

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,600
You two, hurry up and get changed.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,680
Pay attention, everyone.

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,800
It's your turn next.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,480
Come on.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Hurry up!

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,160

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,680
thank you.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,120
Actually, Mr. Martin
wants me to tell you

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
that you are very talented.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,440
Don't let your creativity
be limited by colours.

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
Maybe one day

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,360
we will meet again on stage.

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,960
