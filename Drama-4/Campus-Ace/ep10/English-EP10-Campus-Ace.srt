(Dedicate my all to art)

Momo.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,320
Emergency!

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,200
What now?

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,720
You must help me this time.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,840
The male model for
our afternoon painting class

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,160
stood me up again.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,920
Please help me.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,400
Me?

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,480
You know all the men I know.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,520
I can't help you.

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,280
No.

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,560
You don't have to do anything this time.

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,960
Just stand still beside me.

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,080
Momo.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,800
Please.

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,400
If I ask the security guard
to help me this time,

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,120
our classmates will kill me.

27
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,000
By then...

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,720
Fine!

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,280
How can I help you?

30
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,960
You are the best!

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
Don't miss this chance.

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,120
If you sign up to be our model,

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,600
you can get the contact information
of our campus belle.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,680
I should go.

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
No.

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,360
You promised me.

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,080
I don't want to do this, Han Xiao'ai.

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,840
So many people are here.

39
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Please help me.

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,840
Ren Jie.

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,640
Congratulations

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
on your successful entry into MUA.

43
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
Thanks.

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,960
Why are you free
to come to campus today?

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,080
I was busy today.

46
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,680
However,

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,400
I took a day off to accompany you.

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
Am I that important?

49
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,040
Of course.

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
In my heart,

51
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,520
you will always be my priority.

52
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,880
Isn't this Mr. Ren?

53
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,000
Why?

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,480
Are you here

55
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,560
to reminisce about your lost youth?

56
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm here for Momo.

57
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,520
Momo.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,280
Did he give you this flower?

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes.

60
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,320
I am allergic to pollen.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
That's better.

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,480
Forget it.

63
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I don't want to argue with you.

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,680
Does this campus belle's
WeChat account...

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
belong to Tang Momo?

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
I...

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,880
Tang Momo.

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,880
What a surprise.

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,320
I can't believe you openly gather
a crowd of people to add you.

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
Yes, Momo.

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,200
You have to be careful.

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Don't randomly give your
contact information to strangers.

73
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,520
I asked Momo

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,960
to help me find a model for
our painting class this afternoon.

75
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,520
You can find me if you need a model.

76
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,240
Do you know what you have to do?

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,036
Of course I know.

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,560
Dedicate my all to art.

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,920
I'll do whatever it takes.

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm afraid someone
will devote to the art

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,160
and make another campus headline.

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,400
By the way,

83
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,760
I forgot that someone is going abroad.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,760
Going abroad?

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,600
Yes.

86
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,080
Didn't your dad tell you

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,320
that he came to me some time ago
to consult on universities.

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
He said he would
send you to study abroad.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Are you going abroad?

90
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,560
I don't even know it myself.

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,920
Momo.

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,120
Let's go and eat.

93
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,360
Wait.

94
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,920
Explain it to me.

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
What do you mean by studying abroad?

96
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,880
Don't leave.

97
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,560
Wait.

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,240
What about my model?

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,680
Thank you, sir.

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,880
Thanks for being a big help.

101
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,040
You're welcome.

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm already experienced.

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
And I've caught a few students
breaking the rules recently,

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
so I've gotten a lot of muscle.

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,600
I see.

106
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Well,

107
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm sorry.

108
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,160
Our male model

109
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
couldn't make it today.

110
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,640
But we still have our lovely...

111
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,520
Don't get so excited.

112
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,680
My name is Liu Dehua.

113
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,200
You can call me Hua.

114
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,520
I will be your model for today.

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
I actually know a lot

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
about the modeling industry.

117
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,600
I took a lot of pictures
when I was a kid.

118
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
They are all...

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,880
Hello, everyone.

120
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,920
My name is Wang Tongqing.

121
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,080
I was born on 1st October 2002.

122
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
My height is 180cm.

123
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
My weight is 100kg.

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
100kg?

125
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,160
My hobbies are

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,520
singing, dancing,
and doing some programming.

127
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,440
I look forward to working with you.

128
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,480
-Okay!
-Welcome.

129
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,880
Thanks to these three
gentlemen for their help.

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,240
But as a model,

131
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,040
you need to

132
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,280
take off your clothes.

133
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
Take off our clothes?

134
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,520
Yes.

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,960
Yao.

136
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,080
If you feel embarrassed...

137
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,600
Hello.

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,280
Mum.

139
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,320
Hey! You...

140
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,959
What's up?

141
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,400
Yao.

142
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
If you feel embarrassed,

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,080
we still have
our lovely security guard,

144
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
don't we?

145
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,240
Wait a moment.

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,960
Enough.

147
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,840
I think that's enough
for us to start painting.

148
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Momo.

149
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,960
We...

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
I think this is enough, too.

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Yao.

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,680
Thank you so much today.

153

When will you come next time?

156

Yao.

157
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,720
Come again next time.

158
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
(Wait.)

159
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,320
(Why should I be angry?)

160
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,400
He's so charming.

161
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,240
Come again next time.

162
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,560
