(He's not as bad as I think)

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Help!

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,000
Who is it?

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,080
How dare you do it
right under my nose.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,080
I was being too kind.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,520
Don't move!

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,480
Are you all right?

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,440
Yes.

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,160
What's wrong?

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
Did you make the call?

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,040
Yes.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,160
This is

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,720
the psycho that appears
in the campus lately.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,880
Here's the proof of his crime.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,400
All right.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,320
We'll handle it.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
Get up!

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,880
Go!

00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,400
Why are you so nervous?

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,280
Why would you be here?

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,000
I was passing by.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,240
Well,

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,360
thank you.

33
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,600
I only found out today

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,480
that I misunderstood you.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,960
You're hurt.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
I'll carry you.

38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,880
I don't think it's appropriate.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,280
I'll carry you to the infirmary.

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,320
Come on.

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,879

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,840
I think the teacher went out.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Let me check on your wound.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
I can handle such a minor wound.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,720
Don't move.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,960
(I think I should apply this.)

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,640
This is iodine tincture.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,720
Don't simply use it.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,240
How would I know?

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
It's not stated so.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
Iodine tincture is red in colour.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,120
Are you colour-blind?

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
Of course I can see it.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,680
I just didn't notice.

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,720
(Is she really colour-blind?)

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,680
Allow me.

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,840
Thank you.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Hold on.

59
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,840
(Oh no,)

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
(what does he want?)

61
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,080
(Did he realise anything?)

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,800
What's this number?

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Nine.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440
What's this?

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
98.

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,000
(Luckily I memorised it.)

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,520
Come on.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Hold on.

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,320
(What else does he want?)

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,240
What's

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
the colour of this coat?

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,880
(Forget it. I'll just make a guess.)

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,080
Yellow.

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,880
You're wrong.

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,920
It's green.

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,760
Tang Momo,

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,880
you're actually...

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,880
Don't say it.

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I didn't know

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
a colour-blind person
can study design.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,240
I only have red-green colorblindness.

82
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm not totally colour-blind.

83
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,800
I can see colours, okay?

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,680
Are there different categories?

85
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Of course.

86
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,800
I don't know how you got into
the university with your intelligence.

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
You're sharp-tongued.

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,920
What if

89
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,520
I expose your secret

90
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,560
and you can't enter

91
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,560
MUA?

92
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,960
You...

93
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,200
Come on.

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,320
Young Master Ling.

95
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,760
You must be hungry today

96
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
for doing so much.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,640
I'll

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
let you have the bread.

99
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,720
I don't eat ordinary stuff.

100
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,840
You're hungry.

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,240
If not because of you,

102
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,160
I wouldn't be eating this.

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,840
What do you mean?

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,000
My father

105
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,400
stops giving me pocket money

106
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,120
because of your video.

107
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
Tang Momo.

108
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,920
You're responsible for
my meals from now on.

109
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,640
Me?

110
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,120
Why should I?

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
Do you want to enter MUA?

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you eating my bread?

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm in charge of you.

114
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
So what if I'm eating your bread?

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,720
It's already 11:30 p.m.

116
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,440
I can't go back to the dorm now.

117
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
Just get the administrator
to let you in.

118
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,320
You're ignorant.

119
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,040
If we go back now, our
course credit will be deducted.

120
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Then I won't be able to qualify for MUA.

121
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,640
Are you sure

122
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,200
you want to stay here alone?

123
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
What to do?

124
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,480
I'll just stay here.

125
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I heard that

126
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,880
back then,

127
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,200
at this place,

128
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,320
a female senior

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,200
took sleeping pills.

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
Since then,

131
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,200
whenever it's 12 a.m.,

132
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
you can hear crying for no reason.

133
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,840
It's really scary.

134
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm not scared at all.

135
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,840
Just go.

136
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
Then, I'll go.

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,280
Just go.

138
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,680
Hurry up.

139
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm going for real.

140
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,120
(What kind of a person is he?)

141
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
(He must be scaring me.)

142
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Tang Momo.

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,400
Tang Momo.

144
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,160
Tang Momo.

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,720
You claimed that you weren't scared.

146
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,280
Are you seriously not leaving?

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
It's already late.

148
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
It's troublesome to go back anyway.

149
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,320
I'll just

150
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
stay here tonight.

151
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,680
I know, right?

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,480
It's troublesome, right?

153
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
All right, go to bed.

154
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
(I don't think)

155
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,520
(he's as bad as I imagined.)

156
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,880
Tell me.

157
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
Where did you go last night?

158
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,240
Who were you with?

159
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,280
Xiao'ai.

160
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,320
I apply for five minutes of
uninterrupted self-defence time.

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,880
Fine.

162
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
You'd better come clean.

163
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,680
Yesterday, I went back to our dorm.

164
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
I was walking on the lane

165
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,480
and felt that someone was stalking me.

166
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,080
Suddenly,

167
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,640
Ling Yao appeared.

168
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Ling Yao smashed
the lollipop on that stalker's head.

169
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
It's getting late.

170
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
I couldn't go back to the dorm.

171
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,400
So I could only stay at the infirmary.

172
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,280
Ling Yao is indeed a good person.

173
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,520
We thought he's a bad guy.

174
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,480
No,

175
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,560
he's a bad guy.

176
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm really mad, seriously.

177
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
After he found out
that I was colour-blind,

178
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,320
he forced me,

179
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Tang Momo,

180
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,920
a poor person, to pay for his meals.

181
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm poor, okay?

182
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,440
He's simply too much.

183
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,080
So you slept together.

184
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Look at this.

185
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,320
This

186
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,640
is a list of his hobbies.

187
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
(Aloof. Eat organic food. Basketball lover.
Loves meat. Doesn't take spicy food.)

188
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
He can't take spicy food.

189
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
(He can't take spicy food?)

190
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,080
(It's easy then.)

191
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,280
Thanks, girl.
