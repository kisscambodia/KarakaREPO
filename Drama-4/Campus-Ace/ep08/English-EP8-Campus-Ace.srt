(Stylist for a day)

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,439
It's an interview notice from MUA.

11
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:33,559
Feifei.

12
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:34,719
You are awesome!

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,519
Congratulations!

14
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:36,199
Thanks.

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,599
After I pass the interview,

16
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,039
I'll treat you all to a meal.

17
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,239
It's a deal then.

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,119
Thank you in advance.

19
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,679
No problem.

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,640
(MUA Studio: Tang Momo, congratulations.
You've passed the interview.)

21
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:51,519
Xiao'ai.

22
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:53,799
I got a notification, too.

23
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:54,639
Really?

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,599
I knew you'd make it!

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,439
What is she expecting?

26
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,159
Does she think she'll get into MUA?

27
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:06,799
She should take a look
at herself in the mirror.

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,679
She looks like a pauper.

29
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:10,399
If it were me,

30
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:11,719
I would be too embarrassed
to go to the interview.

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,919
Exactly.

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,199
She doesn't even
have proper attire for it.

33
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,759
I'm afraid she'll disgrace our school.

34
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:18,919
Hey.

35
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,039
Calm down.

36
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:21,839
Let's go.

37
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,399
I'll treat you to lunch.

38
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,359
Forget it, Xiao'ai.

39
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,519
Qiao Nuanfei is going too far.

40
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:35,919
Momo.

41
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,119
You must get into MUA.

42
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,839
Wipe that smug smile off her face.

43
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,839
Of course.

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
Qiao Nuanfei is annoying,

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,359
but

46
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,759
she was right about something.

47
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,839
What is it?

48
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,799
These clothes of yours

49
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,719
are really bad.

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,839
They are too plain.

51
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,639
MUA is a studio known
for their colourful design.

52
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,559
I'm sure all the designers there

53
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,479
are dressed to the nines.

54
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,399
If you wear these clothes
to the interview,

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,799
you won't make a good impression

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,359
before you can say anything.

57
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,519
I think you have a point.

58
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,039
Why don't...

59
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,999
we go clothes shopping on Sunday?

60
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,439
Sure.

61
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,399
Han Xiao'ai.

62
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,559
I'm at the campus gate.

63
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,319
Where are you?

64
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:35,359
Tang Momo.

65
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,959
Why...

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,319
are you here?

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,359
I was waiting for you.

68
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,159
Traitor.

69
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:47,359
Rest assured.

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,919
I have good taste.

71
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,319
Whatever.

72
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:09,759
Ling Yao.

73
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,719
You pick too many.

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,919
They are nice.

75
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:13,879
Trust me.

76
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:14,719
Go ahead and try them out.

77
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,519
Go on.

78
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,199
Come on. Have a try.

79
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,719
What do you think?

80
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,919
Does this look good on me?

81
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,879
Perfect.

82
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,879
This will be it.

83
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,959
Pack the rest for me as well.

84
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,239
Okay, wait a moment.

85
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,559
Mr. Ling, thank you

86
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,639
for spending so much money on me.

87
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,559
Me?

88
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,319
I have no money.

89
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,839
Then why did you ask her to pack all up?

90
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,159
Do you know that this dress alone

91
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,199
costs RMB2,800?

92
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,039
Do you think I have enough money?

93
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,719
Ling Yao.

94
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,159
Can you stop being so childish?

95
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,879
Let's go.

96
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,319
Where are they?

97
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,959
Come on.

98
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,359
So where should we go now?

99
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,199
Let me show you

100
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,999
the fashion factory for poor girls.

101
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,839
Let's go.

102
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:18,319
Are you sure there is
something you can wear here?

103
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,399
You know nothing.

104
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,039
I bought all my clothes here.

105
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,639
That shop.

106
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,399
Let's go then.

107
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:46,799
Lady boss.

108
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:47,759
Pack this for me.

109
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,679
Okay, I'll get you a new one.

110
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,039
Are you sure about this colour?

111
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,039
Why did you pick this?

112
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,519
Do you trust my taste?

113
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:56,719
Fine.

114
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,119
Let's look around.

115
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,639
Ling Yao.

116
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,479
What colour is this?

117
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,039
Red.

118
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,799
Then this may not be suitable.

119
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,839
This is annoying.

120
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,919
I can't figure out

121
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,519
the colour anyway.

122
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,199
I will trust you.

123
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,639
Just pick the one you've chosen.

124
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,159
Why don't you pick one for me, too?

125
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,479
Consider this my reward for being...

126
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,439
your stylist for a day.

127
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,519
Me?

128
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,279
I have trouble identifying colours.

129
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,759
I'm sure I'll pick a weird one for you.

130
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,079
Don't overthink.

131
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,039
Just pick anything.

132
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,279
Anyway,

133
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,079
I look good in any colour.

134
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:45,879
Narcissist.

135
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,839
I'll take my pick then.

136
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,519
Go on. Don't worry.

137
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:01,879
What are you doing?

138
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,439
Are you sure we want
to go out dressed like this?

139
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,679
Are you afraid?

140
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,999
A bit.

141
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:06,719
This is your fault.

142
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:07,599
Why do you have to drag me into this?

143
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,599
Do you dare to walk around?

144
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,159
Let's go.

What do you think?
