(A day as an intern)

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,800
Although you haven't graduated yet,

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,280
since you come out to work,

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,360
you have to keep professionalism.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,160
Respond promptly to work messages

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,840
and solve problems independently.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,960
Don't keep asking me

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,680
when you will be able
to participate in the design.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,480
I don't like an incompetent person
with high ambitions.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,160
If you can't stand the pressure,

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,480
you can go back to your campus.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
Don't waste each other's time.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,560
Yes, miss.

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,320
I got it.

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,240
This is your workplace.

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,920
If you need anything,

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,040
you may ask directly
from the administration.

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,920
Also,

27
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,200
don't call me "miss".

28
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,480
Call me Amanda.

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Yes, Amanda.

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,120
Thank you.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,680
Amanda.

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,440
Are you briefing the interns?

33
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,040
I really envy you.

34
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,840
Unlike me who has to
work hard every day.

35
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,920
Ladies.

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,000
Later, let's have a meal together

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,200
to welcome you two.

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,920
You are unusually efficient.

39
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,000
People would think

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,200
that they're working for your studio.

41
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,760
Martin is asking for me.

42
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,640
I need to go.

43
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,320
See you.

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,560
Listen, both of you.

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,680
You'd better not
play tricks under my nose.

46
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,240
I hate incapable people
who only create troubles.

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,840
You're free, aren't you?

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:01,960
Here.

49
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,720
Here are two copies of design sketches.

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,320
I want you to complete the sample today.

51
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,920
If you can't make it,
you don't have to come tomorrow.

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
I will do my best.

53
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,440
Okay.

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,520
Can either of you

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
help me get the parcel?

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I've completed the sample.

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
I'll go.

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,080
Go ahead.

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,200
(Who moved my sketch?)

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,600
(Oh, no.)

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,240
I got the last piece of fabric.

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,600
Qiao Nuanfei.

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Give me back the fabric.

64
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,480
Tang Momo.

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,640
Are you a robber now?

66
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,400
You stole my sketch

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,240
and deliberately took
the fabric I was going to use.

68
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,920
How dare you say I'm a robber.

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,600
Qiao Nuanfei.

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,640
Aren't you afraid
I'll report to Mr. Martin

71
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,320
if you use such dirty tricks?

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm going to use

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
the same fabric as yours.

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,960
First come first served.

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Why do you blame me?

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,640
You came late

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,320
and accused me of stealing your sketch.

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,480
I think

79
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
you're used to throwing mud
at people, aren't you?

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,920
You!

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
Anyone there?

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
Anyone there?

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,420
(Amanda, I'm trapped in the warehouse.
Can you come and open the door for me?)

84
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
Keep an eye on the runway.

85
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
Make sure the lights and music

86
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,880
are exactly as I said.

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Nothing can go wrong.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,040
All right.

89
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,240
Why are you here alone?

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,640
Where is Tang Momo?

91
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,080
I have no idea.

92
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,680
She probably is slacking off somewhere.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,541
(Amanda, I'm trapped in the warehouse.
Can you come and open the door for me?)

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,960
Looks like she's locked
in the warehouse.
