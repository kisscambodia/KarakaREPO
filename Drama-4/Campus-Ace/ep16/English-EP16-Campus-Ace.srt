(An unexpected kiss)

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,160
Momo.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,920
How did it go?

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,320
Ren Jie is a brat.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
How could he?

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,480
I'll teach him a lesson.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,760
I turned them down.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,920
That's more like it.

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
Ren Group does not deserve

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,640
to cooperate with you.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,920
Let's go

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
for a spin.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,920
Hello.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,360
Right now?

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,240
Okay.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,440
Send me the address then.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,800
Who called?

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,160
Ren Jie

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,080
wants me to look for him now.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,240
He still has the guts to look for you.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
I'll teach him a lesson.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,160
Get into the car.

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Ren Jie.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,920
You're here.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,400
What do you want to tell me?

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,440
Why did you want me to come right away?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,720
Momo.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Regarding

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
what happened,

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm...

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
sorry.

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
It's all my fault.

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
I know that

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,760
what happened today
reminds you of Uncle Tang.

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,920
It makes you upset.

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,480
I was not trying to persuade you
to plagiarise others' work.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,920
I was just trying my best

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,160
for you to achieve

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
your dream.

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
I just want the best for you.

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,280
I hope you can fulfil your
dream of being a designer.

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,840
Actually, you don't have
to do all so much for me.

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
It isn't easy

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,600
to run a company.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,120
However,

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
I want to do it for you.

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,240
You

56
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,440
have always been like a brother to me.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Sorry.

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,360
Why are you apologising to him?

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Stop drinking.

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
You have the nerve to ask Momo out.

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
You promised her the brand cooperation.

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Aren't you ashamed of what you did?

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
At least I tried.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,920
What about you?

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,240
All you do is following her around,

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,040
disturbing her,

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
spending her money

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,080
and wasting her time.

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Aren't you ashamed?

70
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,200
What are you talking about?

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,760
All right, stop arguing.

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,520
I guess I'll have to tell you clearly

73
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
what I have done for her.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,600
Let's see what you have to say.

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,000
I...

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,000
treated her to dinner.

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,680
I also

78
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
dressed her up.

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,400
Momo.

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,120
Momo.

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,240
Momo!

82
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,480
Momo.

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,920
Go away!
