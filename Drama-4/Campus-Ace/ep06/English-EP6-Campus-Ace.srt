(From foes to friends)

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,560
Everyone, attention please.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,480
Explain to everyone.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm sorry, everyone.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,240
It was me

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,280
who destroyed your works.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,680
I was blinded

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,200
by my jealousy of Tang Momo.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,480
So I framed her.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
However,

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,280
the school and the teacher

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,800
have taught me a lesson.

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,200
I saw my mistake.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,760
I shouldn't have damaged your works.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,160
I'll do my best

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,800
to compensate you.

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,280
Please

26
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,400
forgive me.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,560
Would you

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,560
believe in her?

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,440
Listen to me.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Although Jingjing made a mistake,

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,480
I believe she didn't mean it.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,600
I've settled your applications to MUA.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,080
Jingjing is my friend.

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,120
I hope you'll forgive her

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,240
for my sake.

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,120
She won't do it again.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
I promise

38
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,120
that I won't do it again.

39
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,000
What do you think, everyone?

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,080
Yes,

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
to err is human.

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,080
All right.

43
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,440
Don't do it again.

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,600
Go back to your seat.

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,720
Let's start our lesson.

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
It's obviously done by Qiao Nuanfei.

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,680
Huang Jingjing is just a scapegoat.

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
Dear, forget it,

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,040
and accept it.

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,440
Why are you here?

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm here to accept your gratitude.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,880
Why should I be grateful to you?

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,360
Fine.

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Thank you for clearing my name.

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,960
Then I...

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,560
Cook for me.

57
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,000
I mean the soup mentioned by Ren Jie.

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,240
No.

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm not free.

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,480
You can cook something else,

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,000
as long as you're the one who cooks.

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Come on.

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,520
Where are we going?

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
Let's go to the market.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,120
Let's go.

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,800
Hey.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
What

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,880
are you doing?

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,760
Do you think I'm willing
to hold your hand?

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,920
It's red light.

71
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,440
I'm just colour-blind,

72
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
not blind.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,240
Can you tell the traffic light?

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,520
Of course.

75
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,280
I could do that long ago.

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,160
Aren't you colour-blind?

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,080
You seem to be fine.

78
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,600
Are you impressed?

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,880
Don't be smug.

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
I didn't know

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
you're good at selecting a venue.

82
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,440
The balcony is suitable for barbeque.

83
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Stupid woman.

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,480
Why doesn't she get that it's romantic?

85
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,840
What are you mumbling?

86
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,680
Nothing.

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,520
Come on.

88
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,160
I'll show you what I'm capable of today.

89
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,200
Oil.

90
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,240
I know.

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,520
Relax.

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Go away.

93
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,920
Wait over there.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Done.

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,480
How is it?

96
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,640
Do you want to add cumin?

97
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
It's tasty.

98
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,200
Hold it and eat.

99
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,480
Tang Momo.

100
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,560
You're something else.

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,600
Stop complimenting me.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,240
Are you tricking me?

103
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
No.

104
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,600
I just think that

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
you must be working really hard.

106
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,760
It's not a big deal.

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
In order to do what one wants,

108
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,720
isn't working hard the only option?

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,000
What one wants to do?

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,160
I envy you.

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,560
I don't think I have
anything I want to do.

112
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,160
Be patient.

113
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
You will.

114
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,200
Don't just grill it.

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,120
Have some.

116
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,520
It's tasty, right?

117
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,600
