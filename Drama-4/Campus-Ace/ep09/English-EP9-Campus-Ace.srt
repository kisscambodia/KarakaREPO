(The best attire for the interview)

10
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,519
She

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,079
will face crucial decisions in life.

12
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,239
On one side

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,839
is the dominant schoolboy, Ling Yao.

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:33,839
On the other side is

15
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:35,879
the gentle brother next door, Ren Jie.

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,599
Who should she choose?

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,959
Who will be

18
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,999
her true love?

19
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:43,439
Xiao'ai.

20
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:45,839
I'm on Ling Yao's side.

21
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,079
He picked this for you with care.

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,879
It is filled with

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,799
his love.

24
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,639
Ren Jie is so thoughtful as well.

25
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,799
He gave you
the latest ensemble from MUA.

26
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,759
If you wear this to the interview,

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,559
the examiner would impress.

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
Still, I support Ling Yao.

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,359
It's not just about the dress,

30
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,719
but his love for you.

31
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:30,639
My sweet couple

32
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,599
isn't going to end badly, is it?

33
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:33,639
No.

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,199
I just want to get
a feel for the design,

35
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,919
the cut and the fabric from MUA.

36
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:38,599
I'm thinking

37
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,319
maybe I would get asked about it
in the interview later.

38
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,159
Don't you think so?

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,919
What about Ling Yao's love?

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,639
Anyway, the interview
is in the afternoon.

41
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,759
It's not too late to change after class.

42
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,719
Is this outfit really nice?

43
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,839
Of course.

44
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:54,799
You are...

45
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,159
Outfit clash.

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,279
Copy cat.

47
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,199
Only the ugly will get embarrassed.

48
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,519
Hideous.

49
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,359
In this lesson, we will talk about
the design of silk scarves.

50
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,959
Today, these two students are
wearing identical clothes.

51
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,959
Let's have a showdown.

52
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,399
The silk scarves designed by
the students will be used differently

53
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,119
as an important
accessory to the outfit.

54
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,119
Even the same outfit

55
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,439
can look different depending on

56
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,919
the design of the scarf

57
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,439
and how it is tied.

58
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,199
Copy cat.

59
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,159
(Unexpected outfit clash)
She made a fool of herself

60
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,679
in front of the campus belle.

61
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,559
It's obviously the same outfit,

62
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,759
but Qiao Nuanfei's is of high class,

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,479
while yours is off-the-rack?

64
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,119
This is too much!

65
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,039
Her photo looks refined,

66
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,599
but yours is completely blurred.

67
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,526
She did this on purpose, obviously.

68
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,119
Isn't MUA's interview

69
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,399
in the afternoon?

70
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,719
Why don't you wear
the dress I chose for you?

71
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,279
I plan to go back later...

72
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:21,999
I think

73
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,079
it would be more favourable

74
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,839
to wear this outfit

75
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,159
when I go to the interview
at MUA this afternoon.

76
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,559
It's not bad.

77
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:31,439
Of course.

78
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,519
This is thanks to Ren Jie.

79
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,999
What?

80
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,279
Ren Jie?

81
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,279
He has a bad taste.

82
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,599
This outfit doesn't suit you at all.

83
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,159
You said it was not bad.

84
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,039
I mean your face,

85
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,079
not the outfit.

86
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,199
I think the one
I picked suits you better.

87
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,119
Maybe

88
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,799
you should go back
and get changed later.

89
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,799
This outfit doesn't look good on you

90
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,519
when you walk like this.

91
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,439
You should get changed.

92
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,119
Is that so?

93
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,079
(Yue He Canteen)
Wait for me!

94
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,719
Neither the colour nor the design

95
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,759
is right for you.

96
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,319
You get into a designer's
studio depending on skills,

97
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,919
not on how you dress up.

98
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,119
Moreover,

99
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,719
you're wearing the same
outfit as Qiao Nuanfei.

100
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,559
Do you mean I don't
dress as well as her?

101
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,279
No.

102
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,479
That's not it.

103
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,039
I'm just worried about you.

104
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,159
What if all the interviewees
wear the same outfit?

105
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,399
How awkward would that be?

106
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:35,999
Don't you agree?

107
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,959
You said it's about skills.

108
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,639
So outfit clash is not embarrassing.

109
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,799
That's not what I meant.

110
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,799
Your skills are beyond doubt.

111
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,359
Look, there's a snag.

112
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:49,399
Sorry.

113
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,159
Ling Yao.

114
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,279
I am sorry.

115
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,039
I am really sorry.

116
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,159
What are you doing?

117
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,839
I didn't mean to.

118
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,919
This is too much.

119
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,399
What are you doing?

120
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,639
No matter how jealous you are,
you can't sabotage her clothes.

121
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,919
Momo is going to wear
the dress you picked anyway.

122
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,959
I didn't mean to sabotage.

123
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,039
No more excuses.

124
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,839
We had a design class in the morning.

125
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,919
With all the cutting and sewing,

126
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,439
it's easy to scratch our clothes.

127
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,879
Momo didn't want to
ruin the dress you gave her.

128
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,199
So she didn't wear it.

129
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,319
She intended to change
into it before the interview,

130
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,079
right?

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,079
Let's go.

132
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,359
Idiot.

133
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,359
I have a good taste after all.

134
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,279
Momo.

135
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,159
Don't be nervous.

136
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,159
You can do it.

137
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,719
Go ahead.

(Conference Room)

139
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,639
Some things are not meant to be yours.

140
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,839
No matter how hard you try,
you can't get it.

141
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,519
You are an adult.

142
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,079

(MUA Fashion Design Studio)

144
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,279
I like your design.

145
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,799
However,

146
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,479
I think you are aware.

147
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,559
My designs are always
very bold in terms of colour.

148
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,319
Why do you want to join us?

149
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:38,879
Indeed.

150
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,639
I had

151
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:41,839
always followed

152
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,719
the conventional rules of colour.

153
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,959
It was like being trapped in a cage.

154
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,839
However,

155
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,439
I met someone.

156
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,279
He told me that

157
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,519
design is not all about colour.

158
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,479
A designer

159
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,559
shouldn't be bound by colour,

160
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,279
much less locked into regularity.

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,719
So

162
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:01,999
I want to join MUA

163
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,119
and learn from you.

164
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,439
I want to break through
the confinement in the use of colour

165
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,639
and explore a new world of colours.

166
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,079
Explore a new world of colours?

167
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,759
That's a very innovative reason.

168
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,199
