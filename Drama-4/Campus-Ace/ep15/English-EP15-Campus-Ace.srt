107
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,120
That way, we don't
need to set up a stall.

a version of Anipop you can play.

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,720
Are you thirsty

123
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
or hungry?

124
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,200
I'll buy you something.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm not thirsty

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,720
nor hungry.

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,960
Can you find something else to do?

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,040
Ren Group's customer bases

129
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,800
are mid-to-high end markets

130
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,040
of mature women in their thirties.

131
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,200
At this point, women

132
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,480
are at a stage where
their career and families

133
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,920
become fixed.

134
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,480
Based on

135
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,000
their desire for
breakthrough and change,

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
we propose

137
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,320
the theme of Beyond Self.

138
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,160
Ms. Tang.

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,360
Your theme

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
matches

141
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
our target positioning in the market.

142
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,640
Thank you.

143
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,720
However, your work is still lacking.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,960
It's not about promoting an alternative

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
or being different.

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,920
I'm

147
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,680
seeking a breakthrough from
the perspective of colour.

148
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,440
Fashion design still needs

149
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
to follow the trend.

150
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
Otherwise, the so-called
colour breakthrough

151
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,280
will mean nothing.

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
I have some

153
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,000
of the big brands' upcoming
fall and winter styles here.

154
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,880
I hope you can refer to them

155
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,240
instead of wasting your time.

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
Are you expecting me

157
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,440
to plagiarise their work?

158
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
You can interpret it

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
as standing on the shoulders of giants

160
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
to improve yourself.

161
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Sorry.

162
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,640
I don't think we can
continue working together.

163
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,800
(Conference Room)

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,120
Momo.

165
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Is the meeting over?

166
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,360
What's wrong?

167
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,600
Mr. Wang.

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,960
What happened?

169
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,160
I just told Ms. Tang

170
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
to refer to the experiences
of her predecessors.

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,760
You can get back to work.

172
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,160
Momo.

173
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,560
Actually,

174
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,720
I think you can learn
slightly from them.

175
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,280
Even you are persuading
me to plagiarise?

176
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,680
I...

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
Don't you know my father...

178
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
Wait for a moment.

179
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
I'll get going.

180
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,400
Hello, father.

181
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,120
What do you think you're doing?

182
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,480
Why is Rmall, the online store,
still losing money?

183
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,400
Sorry.

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I'm trying to optimise it.

185
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,880
Don't think about other things.

186
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,480
Our company's design project

187

cannot be simply assigned

188
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
to an inexperienced student.

189
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,760
If Mr. Wang didn't remind me,

190
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,640
what else would you do?

191
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,160
No.

192
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,960
Momo...
