(Mr. Ling's office)

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,520
Why are you here as well?

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,680
Is this your territory?

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,400
Don't bother.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,320
She is right.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,920
Don't bother.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,400
Why do you think

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Yao let us come over here

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,480
mysteriously at night?

(Crabapple Yacht Club)

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,360
From now on,

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,240
this is our home base to venture.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
Exactly.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,400
This is the starting point
of our dream in life.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,840
The first step towards
the peak of our life.

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
I took a long time

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,400
to seek this office.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
Office?

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,080
Does this mean

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,480
our entrepreneurial project

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,240
has been launched?

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,560
From now on,

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,200
you may come here
to make clothes anytime.

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,480
Your classroom has access restrictions.

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,440
Now,

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,080
this place is open to you 24 hours.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,280
I'm dying of jealousy.

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Lemon on a lemon tree.

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,160
You and I under a lemon tree.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
Enough.

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Stop fooling around.

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,640
Let's get in and see the office.

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,760
Let's go.

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,720
There is

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,000
a weird smell.

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,800
What's this?

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Why is it so dark?

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
Cover it.

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Is the starting point of our dream

48
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,520
buried by dust?

49
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,120
Yao.

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,520
What...

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
What's the situation?

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
We've been cheated.

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,280
It's owned by my relative.

54
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
They had bad business.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
The rent is cheap.

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,800
We don't have much
money to start a business.

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,440
We should spend wisely.

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,680
Actually,

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,920
it's quite...

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,880
It'll be clean

61
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,240
after a clean-up.

62
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:44,840
Sure.

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,720
It's spacious.

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,480
You picked this place.

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Agree?

66
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,880
You'll clean it.

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,760
Me?

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,920
Alone?

69
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,280
Momo and I

70
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
will do purchase together.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,760
I'm going, too.

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,920
Me, too.

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,800
Fatty.

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,320
Aren't we friends?

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,920
Help me.

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,360
Xiao'ai.

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
Help me.

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,760
Then we'll

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,720
set off.

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,240
This is it.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
Why do I have nothing to wear?

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,000
This one.

83
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,920
Forget it.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,840
Is it too late for me to buy one now?

85
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,160
Please.

86
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
You have more than enough.

87
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
It's not your first date anyway.

88
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,800
Why all the fuss?

89
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,200
This is good enough.

90
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
It's not a date.

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,560
This one.

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,120
Ms. Tang.

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,400
Do you like it?

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,080
What do you think?

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,840
This one.

96
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,680
Buy it.

97
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,520
Ling Yao.

98
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,960
This sofa is so comfortable.

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,920
Then a worker is massaging you.

100
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,760
What do you think?

101
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
Secretary Ling.

102
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,440
Ms. Tang.

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
How is my schedule for today?

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,800
You have a meeting
with Mr. Han

105
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
later this afternoon.

106
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,120
Then you need to check on

107
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,240
the situation in the company.

108
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,240
I approve

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,400
this document.

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,760
Yes, Ms. Tang.

111
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,880
We've almost done purchasing.

112
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,440
Let's go.

113
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,840
Please.

114
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,480
This bed.

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,840
It's so soft.

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,680
This is so comfortable.

117
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
How do you like it?

118
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,800
Clearly, you're newlyweds.

119
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,000
Our bed

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
has a special design

121
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,640
and it's solid.

122
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,240
So,

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
do you think...

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,520
Wait.

125
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
This place

126
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,440
turns out to be nice

127
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,800
after a clean-up.

128
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,440
But I feel that

129
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,280
it lacks of something.

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,200
Don't you know?

131
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,120
Come with me.

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,200
It's done.

133
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,640
I've always been curious.

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
Why do you want to call it Unique?

135
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,840
I believe

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
that everyone
is a unique individual.

137
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I also hope

138
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,720
that everyone

139
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,680
gets to find

140
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
their own unique clothes.

141
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,560
And

142
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,000
a unique person for them.

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,320
It's just like

144
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,880
you and me.

145
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,440
