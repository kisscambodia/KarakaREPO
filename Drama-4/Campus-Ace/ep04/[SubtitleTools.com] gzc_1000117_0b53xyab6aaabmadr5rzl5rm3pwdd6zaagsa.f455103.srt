(The power of MUA)

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,160
As promised, I'm treating you
to a meal, Mr. Ling.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,120
I ordered so much food.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,640
Yao.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,360
You don't

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,520
take spicy food, right?

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,360
You don't?

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
What should I do?

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,280
I can't live without spicy food.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,000
It seems we can't eat together everyday.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,440
Says who?

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,120
I've been having spicy food since young.

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,040
Go on.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't just eat meat.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,880
Chillies

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,880
are the essence

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,960
of this dish.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,480
Forget it if you can't eat it.

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
This is just the appetiser.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,480
Are you sure?

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,960
Eat more then.

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,320
Why don't the two of you
drink some water?

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,320
Han Xiao'ai.

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680
Are you insulting him?

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,560
Yao said he could take spicy food,

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,720
yet you're offering him water.

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
Are you looking down on him?

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,840
Do you want Yao to lose?

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,960
That's not my intention!

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,960
It is!

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
I think we have similar taste.

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,880
We

41
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,160
should eat together everyday.

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,760
Thanks for lunch.

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,480
You are not done yet.

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,800
Don't forget about your secret.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Why aren't you wiping this away?

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Go back to rest after eating.

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,040
Yao!

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,080
Yao.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Momo.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,600
Are you all right?

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,000
Take a sip of water.

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,520
It's so spicy.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
(Ling Yao)

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Tang Momo.

55
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm hungry.

56
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
I need breakfast.

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,840
Get lost.

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,200
By the way,

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,680
what's the place you want to enter?

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
MUA?

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,440
Waiting for me.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
(Salt)

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,040
I'll make it salty.

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,600
I'll make it salty.

65
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
It's so salty that you'll cry.

66
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,080
Have some, too.

67
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,560
Breakfast is essential.

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,920
Have some porridge.

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,080
No. Enjoy it.

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Go on.

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,240
You'll eat instead.

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Eat it.

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm really not taking it.

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Do you want me to feed you?

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
I'll do it myself.

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,000
Is it tasty?

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,560
Dig in.

78
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,680
(Get a parcel for me. Ling Yao.)

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,160
(MUA.)

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,120
There're so many parcels.

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
Just get them in a few batches.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,880
Are you stupid?

83
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,360
Fine!

84
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm stupid.

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Are you happy?

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
(Send a sunblock to
the basketball court.)

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,920
(MUA.)

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,520
It's so annoying!

89
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,519
(Send a sunblock to the basketball court. MUA.)
[*MUA: equals to "Mwah" in English]

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,480
Wow!

91
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,920
They're progressing so fast.

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,680
What did I miss?

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
I must witness

94
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
such beautiful love.

95
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
Ling Yao, watch the ball!

96
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,840
You're here.

97
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
Here's my latest work.

98
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,400
Come on, girl.

99
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,520
Are you starting your
romance manga again?

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,280
This is the latest progress
of Momo and Lingyao.

101
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,200
You have no idea.

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
When you're together,

103
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
it looks sweet.

104
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,160
Thank you very much.

105
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,560
He's coming.

106
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,480
Go on.

107
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,280
No.

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,240
Towel.

109
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Wipe my sweat.

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Forget it.

111
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,600
There's a stain on your eyes.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll wipe it for you.

113
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,240
Are you crazy?

114
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
It's not a stain.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I smeared my eyeliner thanks to you!

116
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Mr. Ling.

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
Isn't it enough that I've been

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
serving you day and night?

119
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,240
You want me to wipe your sweat.

120
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
Can't you do it yourself?

121
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm telling you.

122
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
MUA won't work.

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Stop mentioning MUA to me.

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,760
I won't give in to you!

125
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
