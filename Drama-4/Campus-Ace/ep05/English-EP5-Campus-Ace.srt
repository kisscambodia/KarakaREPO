(I'll be your armour)

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,600
What's going on?

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,440
I don't know.

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,640
Why aren't you going in?

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,240
This...

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,680
Tang Momo.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
Did you return to the classroom

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,320
after leaving the basketball court?

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,280
Yes,

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:41,920
but...

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,080
It's indeed you.

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,720
In order to enter MUA,

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,920
you actually destroyed
all our competing works.

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,080
I didn't.

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,680
I did return,

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,200
but I didn't touch your works.

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,520
How can you explain

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
the fact that your desk
is the tidiest?

27
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,080
I...

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,280
Teacher, I didn't.

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,400
Enough.

30
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,880
Stop fighting.

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
The school will investigate this.

32
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,680
It's time for class.

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,600
Let's go to another classroom.

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,160
However,

35
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,800
you have yet...

36
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,720
It's all right.

37
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,840
Rest assured.

38
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,040
I'll try to

39
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,320
find a way.

40
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,880
Let's listen to the teacher.

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,240
However,

42
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,120
teacher,

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
if Tang Momo joins us,

44
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm afraid

45
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,520
everyone will be against her.

46
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,960
Tang Momo,

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
don't go first.

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,120
Take care of this first.

49
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,040
You...

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,720
Yao, why are you walking so fast?

51
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,160
You didn't do it.

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,520
They're setting me up.

53
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,760
Someone must have
been plotting against me.

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,880
God knows what's awaiting me.

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,720
Aren't you letting it go?

56
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,640
I'll count to three.

57
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,800
If you don't let go, I'll...

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,640
Yao, you walk so fast...

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,240
Tang Momo!

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,560
It was dangerous.

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,880
Are you all right?

62
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,880
No.

63
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,640
I'm fine.

64
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,640
Why are you suddenly back, brother Ren Jie?

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,560
It's because I missed you.

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,640
I'm all grown up. Stop teasing me.

67
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,480
You're all grown up,
yet you're so clumsy.

68
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
If I wasn't here,

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,560
what would have happened to you?

70
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,000
She has me.

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,360
Ling Yao?

72
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,560
How did you get to know Tang Momo?

73
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,640
Do you know Momo, too?

74
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:46,960
Ling Yao.

75
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you know brother Ren Jie?

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,800
Brother?

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,400
Yao.

78
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,760
Momo.

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,840
Are you all right?

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,240
What's the heir of Ren Group

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,760
doing here?

82
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,560
Isn't the heir of Ling Group here, too?

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,200
What are you doing here?

84
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,960
Of course I'm here to help out.

85
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,520
What can you

86
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,480
possibly do?

87
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,920
It happens

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,920
that I'm more capable than you.

89
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
This is ruined.

90
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,240
I'll

91
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
get a new one for you.

92
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,800
I can get one for you, too.

93
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I can fix it for you.

94
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Can you fix this?

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,080
Of course.

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,280
I rely on my ability,

97
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,720
unlike someone

98
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,680
who solves a problem using money.

99
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,320
I'll fix it.

100
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,560
Can you really do it?

101
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,520
Relax.

102
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,440
It'll be done soon.

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,400
Are you hungry?

104
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Do you want to have a meal together?

105
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,680
No, thanks.

106
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll eat when I'm back.

107
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,240
All right.

108
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,000
Speaking of meals,

109
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
I miss your pork rib soup.

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
(You want to drink soup?)

111
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,360
(Dream on.)

112
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
Of course.

113
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,720
I have a secret recipe
for pork rib soup.

114
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
If you want to have it,

115
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,280
I'll make it for you.

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,160
All right.

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Why should you cook soup?

118
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,560
What's so good about soup?

119
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,560
Yao.

120
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,240
Why are you looking for me?

121
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,040
Why is it with you?

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
I'd been looking for it.

123
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,920
Thanks, Yao...

124
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,760
You wrecked the clsssroom
yesterday, right?

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,280
What are you talking about?

126
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,480
Don't listen to other people lying.

127
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,800
Stop denying it.

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,240
It's captured on
the surveillance camera.

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
Impossible.

130
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,480
I already took care of...

131
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
What did you do?

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,640
You're blowing your cover, right?

133
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
What did I say?

134
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,840
I lost my purse.

135
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,840
So I watched the surveillance footage.

136
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
That's how I know
the surveillance camera is spoilt.

137
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,840
It's not.

138
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,360
I've asked Fatty to restore
your deleted footage.

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,960
You can't get away with it.

140
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,080

and fallen for you for ten years.

145
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,880
Do you seriously not care

146
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,320
about my feelings at all?

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Are you seriously exposing me

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,280
over the insignificant Tang Momo?

149
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,280
