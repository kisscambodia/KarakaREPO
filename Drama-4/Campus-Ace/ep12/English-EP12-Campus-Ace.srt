(Don't treat her to a fancy meal)

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,520
By the way,

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,000
I saw your parents yesterday.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,320
I've made it clear to them
about what happened at the campus.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,640
Your father doesn't blame you anymore.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,400
Actually, I support you to
start your own business.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,360
I believe you can
make a career out of it

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,200
even without the support of your family.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,040
Then why did you tell my mother

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,800
that you want to study abroad with me?

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,200
Your mother suggested it.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,440
I feel uncomfortable to refuse her.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,520
If

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,760
you study abroad,

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,560
what about your internship at MUA?

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,600
Of course the internship
is not as important as you.

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,120
I really wonder how you got into MUA.

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,480
I will not go abroad.

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,960
Let alone with you.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,640
But...

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,560
Momo.

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,800
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,960
Isn't it obvious?

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,040
He can afford to treat others a meal,

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,120
but pretends to be poor
in front of me every day.

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,400
He's such a fraud.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,080
I don't think the point is

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,880
about money.

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
Don't ever ask me out
under my mother's banner again.

38
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
This is the last time.

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
Thank you for lunch.

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,160
Are we just going to walk back?

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,720
Our school is so far. I'm exhausted already.

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
We can lose some weight while at it.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,320
But we need to eat to lose weight.

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,360
Where are you going?

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,480
Get in.

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,400
Come back here.

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,560
Momo, we can get a lift.

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,880
Don't miss this chance.

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,800
If you are mad at him,

50
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,120
you can sit in the passenger seat
and scold him harshly.

51
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,920
Okay?

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I'm not angry.

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,400
I don't like steak anyway.

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,440
Xiao'ai.

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,400
What?

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,560
What's wrong with her?

57
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,880
This is all your fault.

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
What?

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
I was going to eat
steak with Momo today,

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
but we saw you and Qiao Nuanfei.

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,120
You know that

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,640
Momo and Qiao Nuanfei don't get along.

63
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
Why did you have to flirt with her?

64
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm so disappointed on you!

65
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,080
I didn't flirt with Qiao Nuanfei.

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,240
Then why did you
treat her to a fancy meal?

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,440
You put me in a difficult position.

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,640
I have a friend.

69
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,880
Which friend?

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,920
Do I know your friend?

71
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,400
Boy or girl?

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
Single?

73
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,760
Yao.

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
Go on.

75
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
I have a friend.

76
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,280
He seems to have

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
upset a girl

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,920
because

79
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,800
he went for a meal with another girl.

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,120
Went for a meal?

81
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,480
Then this girl thought

82
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,720
he had treated another girl to a fancy meal.

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Actually,

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,520
it was the girl who
treated him to that meal.

85
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
So what should I...

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
What should my friend do?

87
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,920
Is that girl

88
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,080
good-looking?

89
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Yao.

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,720
I think you should...

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,240
That friend of yours

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
should invite her to a fancy meal.

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,320
Fancy meal?

94
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,040
There is nothing a meal can't fix.

95
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you think everyone is like you?

96
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,520
Can a meal solve the problem?

97
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,600
Girls

98
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,680
have to be coaxed.

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Coax?

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,360
First step,

101
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,600
you have to admit your mistake.

102
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,160
Whether you are wrong or not,

103
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,240
who's at fault,

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,240
who is to blame,

105
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,039
you have to surrender first.

106
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,600
(Don't be mad. I did wrong, execuse me?)
you have to surrender first.

107
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,480
(Don't be mad. I did wrong, execuse me?)

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,240
Then give her a gift.

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
Like candy, chocolate or something.

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,440
As long as it makes her happy.

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,640
Anything.

112
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,320
Then,

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
if it still doesn't work,

114
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,120
you need to use the ultimate move.

115
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,760
Kiss her.

116
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,520
Hug her.

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,480
Lift her up.

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,960
Isn't that

119
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
kind of impolite?

120
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,280
Polite?

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,200
Can politeness make girls happy?

122
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,360
No!

123
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,840
-Sorry. Don't be mad.
-I'm not angry.

124
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,200
Can you stay away from me?

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
You're still angry.

126
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,360
Let's go.

127
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,240
I treat you to a fancy meal.

128
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,280
Hello, aunt.

129
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,400
It's me, Feifei.

130
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,400
Ling Yao...

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,240
Here.

132
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,720
Just order whatever you like.

133
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,040
It's too expensive.

134
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,960
Don't worry.

135
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Just order whatever you like.

136
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,560
I am rich.

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
Then I'll not stand on ceremony.

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,480
(Crabapple Dining Room)

139
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,120
Ling Yao.

140
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Mum.

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,480
How long are you going to be
at loggerheads with us?

142
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,920
What do you mean?

143
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,160
You were the ones who
deactivated my card in the first place.

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,040
As long as you agree to
study abroad with Feifei,

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,760
we will reactivate your card right away.

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,480
How many times have I told you?

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't want to go.

148
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,920
Can you guys leave my life alone?

149
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,400
Is it because of her?

150
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
I will not approve of you
and my son being together.

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
That's not it, aunt.

152
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
You misunderstood.

153
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
I just want her.

154
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,320
Ling Yao, how dare you?

155
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,160
Momo, let's go.

156
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,440
If you walk out that door,
don't think about going home.

157
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,200
It's not a big deal.

158
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,440
I can get a new place on my own.

159
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,440
Ling Yao!

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Geez.

161
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,480
He's out of my hands now.

162
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,120
Aunt, calm down.

163
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,360
I believe

164
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,000
Ling Yao will certainly listen to you

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,160
and study abroad.

166
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,880
Feifei.

167
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,200
Do not worry.

168
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I will never let
that girl into our family.

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,160
I like you since you were little.

170
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,920
I am sorry.

171
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
I didn't expect this to happen.

172
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,120
I just wanted to
treat you to a fancy meal.

173
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,240
It's fine.

174
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not hungry either.

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,320
Why

176
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,440
did you say that earlier?

177
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,160
That's because

178
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,200
my mother keeps bothering my life.

179
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
She tried to set me up
with Qiao Nuanfei.

180
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,280
So in a pinch,

181
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,280
I had to ask for your help.

182
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
You wouldn't mind, would you?

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,160
I don't mind.

184
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,160
So,

185
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,920
I'll go back first.

186
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
