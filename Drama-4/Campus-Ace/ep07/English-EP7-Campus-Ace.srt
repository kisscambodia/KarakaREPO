(Never give up until the end)

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
(Childish.)

(However,)

(up close,)

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,040
(his eyes are)

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,680
(quite pretty.)

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,360

(Ling Yao?)

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Gosh. What am I thinking?

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,000
Just sleep.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
(I guess she's asleep.)

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Unrequited love.

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,680
It must be hard for him.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,440
I really don't know where to begin.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,280
Tang Momo.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,680
How many times have I told you?

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
We do design,

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
not assembly-line work.

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,120
Especially in clothing design,

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
you have to inspire your own creativity.

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
Use your brain.

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,120
You're not going to get into MUA

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,480
with this boring colour design.

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
Go back and think about it.

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,680
Look at you frowning.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
You can even squeeze a fly
between your eyebrows.

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,120
What's wrong?

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,680
Were you scolded by the teacher?

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,880
Maybe being a designer
is just wishful thinking

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,480
for colour blind people.

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
I'm thinking.

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
Maybe I should choose

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,920
a different career.

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,960
What did the teacher say

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,560
that made you feel so upset?

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
The teacher said I was
conservative with the colours.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
It's impossible for me
to get into MUA.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Conservative with the colours?

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,880
Is that a bad thing?

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm too conservative to be competitive.

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,520
You learn to design because
you want to compete with others

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,040
or to express yourself?

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,040
Besides, design is
not all about colours.

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,120
The teacher is not
necessary correct either.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,440
Don't lose confidence in yourself.

55
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,360
I think you are talented.

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,120
Really?

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,560
Of course.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,040
So cheer up.

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,840
Let's go.

60
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,040
I'll take you to a place for some fun.

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,120
For...

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,080
some fun?

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,480
This is what you mean by having fun?

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,760
Yes.

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,080
Cheer me on later.

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Shout out all your unhappiness.

67
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,800
Are you asking me to
relieve stress or to support you?

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,080
Yao, why are you here?

69
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,640
Didn't you hurt your hand this morning?

70
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Yes.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
Didn't the coach tell you

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,200
to sit this one out?

73
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Yes.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,720
I'm fine.

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,560
No matter what,

76
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,280
I have to play this game.

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,640
Watch carefully.

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
I'll win the game.

79
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,360
I'll go and get changed.

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,840
Let's go.

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
You're here.

82
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,640
Do you think they can win today?

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,920
Of course.

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,920
You look so good today.

85
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,240
Tang Momo.

86
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,280
This is my spot.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,320
Who says it's yours?

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,000
Do you have proof?

89
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,560
This is Feifei's spot!

90
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
Do you think you're a princess

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,560
and can order people around?

92
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,240
Tang Momo.

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,280
Do you want to move or not?

94
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
I won't move.

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,520
What can you do to me if I don't move?

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,360
Hey.

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
If you want to fight, do it outside.

98
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,040
The game is about to start.

99
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,560
Don't disturb us watching the game.

100
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,160
Bye.

101
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,680
Bye.

102
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,440
It's started.

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
The rivalry is too intense this year.

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,560
Almost all the spectators
came to watch Ling Yao.

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,000
(Ling Yao, you're always in my heart.)

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,480
The fans are too powerful,

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,240
but they still can't stop
the blue team from attacking.

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
The blue team is scoring goals.

109
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
There they go again!

110
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
It seems like a long shot.

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
Time is running out.

112
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,640
Can Ling Yao lead
his team to a comeback?

113
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,320
The fans are still hopeful.

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,080
Pass the ball.

115
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
(Come on! You're the best!)

116
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Come on!

117
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,040
Ling Yao!

118
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,240
Ling Yao got the ball!

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,120
Can he make history?

120
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:36,240
Ling Yao!

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
Come on!

122
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,120
Scored!

123
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
Ling Yao scored three points!
