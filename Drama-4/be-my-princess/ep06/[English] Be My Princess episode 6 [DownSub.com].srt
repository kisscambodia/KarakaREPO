191
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,420
After he's come to life,

192
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,140
we will have doctors from the neurology department

193
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,780
and the neurosurgery department

194
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,820
to operate consultation for him.

195
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,060
He's condition now is...

196
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,420
Slay, slay.

197
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,100
Get out of my way.

198
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
I...

199
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,340
Who arrested me here?

200
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,580
Tingzhou.

201
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,340
Stop fooling around.

202
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,580
Who is this Tingzhou you keep calling?

203
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,700
You don't recognize your parents?

204
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,650
So you were trying to poison me and perplex me,

205
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,260
pretending to be my relatives so that I'll let loose.

206
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,580
Don't you know that

207
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,900
I've lost my parents since an early age?

208
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,210
You not only poisoned me,

209
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,620
but also cut my hair.

210
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,540
Don't you know that our body, hair and skin are given by our parents?

211
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,860
You intend to put me into this disloyal and disobedient state.

212
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,300
What are you talking about?

213
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,820
I've been a director for my whole life,

214
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,500
and I never saw an actor

215
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,900
is so brought into the character like you.

216
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,890
You got carried away.

217
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Uncle and auntie,

218
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,620
can I talk in privacy with Tingzhou for a while?

219
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,740
OK?

220
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,900
OK.

221
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,010
Let's go.

222
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,460
Mu.

223
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,820
Grand Tutor.

224
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,780
We mean no harm to you.

225
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,260
You are very weak right now.

226
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,180
Can you put this down first?

227
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,090
Let's have a good talk.

228
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,100
You recognize me?

229
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,860
Then tell me.

230
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,740
Who sent you here?

231
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,940
Why do you imprison me here?

232
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,860
Who is this Tingzhou?

233
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,500
Where to start?

234
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,690
First I want to tell you that

235
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,940
the Ning Dynasty collapsed hundreds of years ago.

236
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,890
Nonsense.

237
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,260
This is called electric lamp.

238
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,619
This is called television.

239
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,250
This is called cell phone.

240
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,339
Come on, smile.

241
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,540
Look.

242
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,410
Electric lamp, television.

243
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,490
We've got them in every household.

244
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,780
Even three-year-olds know how to use a cell phone.

245
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,940
What you see right now is not magic,

246
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,060
nor illusion.

247
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,980
These are the wisdom

248
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,700
of hundreds of years of human beings' endeavor.

249
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,540
What can bring someone from dreams

250
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,300
to hundreds of years later,

251
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,020
if not magic or illusion,

252
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,140
must be witchcraft.

253
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,980
My turn now.

254
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,100
Please.

255
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,660
Tingzhou,

256
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,660
why do you all take me as him?

257
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,980
You are Mu Tingzhou.

258
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,180
You are the actor playing the role of Mu Yun.

259
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,660
What do you mean by actor?

260
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,580
To put it into ancient sayings,

261
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,220
you are a playactor.

262
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,060
How dare you compare me to a playactor?

263
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,860
No, no, no.

264
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,220
The identity and status of actors now

265
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,000
are equal with ordinary people.

266
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,100
A good actor

267
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,700
is actually very respectable.

268
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,460
I have a question.

269
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:43,900
Go ahead.

270
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Before you woke up,

271
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,980
what happened on earth?

272
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
And where were you?

273
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,820
Abiding by His Majesty's edict,

274
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,820
I'm temporarily working as the Grand Tutor,

275
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,900
to teach the prince and princess.

276
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,820
Oh my god.

277
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,340
He's still in episode one of the script.

278
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,290
Do you trust me, Mr. Mu?

279
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,660
Your Highness is the only one I trust in this world.

280
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,300
Since you trust me,

281
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,620
can you listen to me?

282
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,420
Please, go ahead.

283
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,490
Mr. Mu,

284
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,460
you've always been

285
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,620
a very respectable senior actor for me.

286
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,820
Shooting the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister together with you,

287
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,170
I've perceived

288
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,860
your dedication into acting.

289
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,100
Perhaps that's why

290
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,700
you've mistaken yourself as

291
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,780
the role in the play after the car crash,

292
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,820
Grand Tutor Mu.

293
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,170
I've read all the scripts

294
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,140
of the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister.

295
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,100
After reading these,

296
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,010
I'm even more certain that I'm Mu Yun, the Grand Tutor,

297
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,540
and not what you call

298
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,100
Mu Tingzhou.

299
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,380
Why?

300
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,220
The scripts are ridiculous and unfounded.

301
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,340
We have a huge disparity in identity, Your Highness,

302
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,820
and I was entrusted by His Majesty.

303
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,980
How could I be obsessed with Your Highness for a lifetime?

304
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,500
This is why it's ridiculous.

305
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,760
Your Highness is naive and pure, royal and unattainable.

306
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,580
-How could you have feelings for me? -No way.

307
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,330
This is why it's unfounded.

308
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,310
If I'm really Mu Tingzhou,

309
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,870
I wouldn't have accepted

310
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,520
these plots that made no sense

311
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,920
so as to lose what I pursue.

312
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,420
This...

313
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,140
A play

314
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,420
needs to be dramatic.

315
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,690
The plots of our relationship

316
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,380
have been emphasized by the scriptwriter.

317
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,300
Since you've known that this isn't true,

318
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,140
why did you take it seriously?

319
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,420
They created this script

320
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,620
with the obvious intention

321
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,410
to sow discord between me and His Majesty, and Your Highness.

322
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,090
To cause chaos in the Ning Dynasty.

323
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,660
Drop it.

324
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,860
Mr. Mu.

325
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,420
You almost got me.

326
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,200
It's true that this play is a fiction.

327
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,180
So,

328
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,400
the Grand Tutor Mu is no real person.

329
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,750
There is only Mu Tingzhou in the world,

330
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,980
no Grand Tutor Mu.

331
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,190
Your Highness, if you want me to believe in these words.

332
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,580
Then I am not me,

333
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,220
you are not you either.

334
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,370
Without this relationship,

335
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,500
is there any difference between you and the others outside?

336
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,820
In other words,

337
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,860
I respect you

338
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,060
as a minister only because of you, Your Highness.

339
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,500
I trust you and respect you.

340
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,060
This is not right.

341
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,180
These vicious people had brought Your Highness,

342
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,690
they must not let His Majesty and Crown Prince go.

343
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,060
Maybe they have...?

344
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,580
I have to go and look for them.

345
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,700
Wait a moment!

346
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,420
They....

347
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,900
They are all fine.

348
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,420
Your Highness, you just told me everything was all just a play.

349
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,940
Why would you recognize that

350
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,580
His Majesty and Crown Prince exist now.

351
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,900
I, I was just....

352
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,810
in a trance

353
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,060
and memorized something.

354
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,580
Anyway, they are fine.

355
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,660
You don't trust me?

356
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,090
Your Highness, those villains must have drugged you and

357
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,210
messed up your memories.

358
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,580
I surely trust your

359
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,460
words.

360
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,940
But Your Highness,

361
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,740
the world is a strange place.

362
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,140
I have heard that

363
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,340
there are strange poisons in Miao area,

364
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,580
you could get illusions if you take one of the poisons.

365
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,930
And you would not differentiate between illusion and reality just like Chuang Chou Dreaming a Butterfly.

366
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,610
I do not know

367
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,290
how they had brought us

368
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,300
here and

369
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,170
what are their purposes.

370
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,580
But I will try my best to

371
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,130
find their weakness and

372
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,010
take you back.

373
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,370
How did this happen?

374
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,940
He seems seriously ill.

375
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,620
Thank God you have reacted fast,

376
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
otherwise I would need to find him a Crown Prince.

377
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,820
Miss Ming,

378
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,660
Tingzhou trusts only you for now.

379
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,540
So,

380
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,620
you have to do us

381
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,660
a favor.

382
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
What is it?

383
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,740
Miss Ming,

384
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,180
can you please help to

385
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,420
talk to Tingzhou during this period of time

386
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,690
as princess.

387
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,340
Try to guide him to do the psychological therapy.

388
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,940
Mr. Mu must have gotten the psychogenic amnesia.

389
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,260
Patients usually

390
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,940
launch self-defense mechanism after

391
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,300
suffering from a painful strike.

392
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,610
They would erase all the memories

393
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,940
which caused their pain.

394
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,780
Is it because he could not accept the fact that

395
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,220
the princess killed herself?

396
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
So that he chose to forget

397
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,260
what happened after.

398
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,100
It is reasonable that you say so.

399
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,500
Do you have any specific

400
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,530
treatment plan?

401
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,090
We can try hypnosis to

402
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,220
pull him back to the reality from the play.

403
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,540
I disagree.

404
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,170
He would resist badly if

405
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,820
we push him too hard.

406
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,780
He would strongly resist if we

407
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,700
use hypnosis as a treatment method.

408
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,820
So do you mean

409
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,410
there is nothing we can do?

410
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,180
I have something in my mind.

411
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,940
What is it?

412
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,260
Look,

413
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,940
he does not trust us now.

414
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,060
But he truly trusts the princess.

415
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,020
Mr. and Mrs. Mu,

416
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,660
I would love to help Mr. Mu.

417
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,460
But I feel

418
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,580
it is like quench a thirst with poison

419
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,210
if I do this as the princess.

420
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,620
It's a band-aid at best.

421
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,210
Most importantly,

422
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,850
I don't have the confidence to pull Mr. Mu out of the play.

423
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,420
Safe belt.

424
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,810
Miss, fasten your safe belt.

425
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,010
Don't think too much.

426
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,180
We cannot

427
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,420
help anything.

428
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,260
It's right that you have turned them down.

429
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,180
I am alright.

430
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,940
I am just...

431
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,930
I am just a little sad.

432
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,140
It turns out

433
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,100
there is nothing I can help.

434
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,860
If there is any way to

435
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,130
help Mr. Mu get better,

436
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,010
I would definitely do it.

437
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,690
But...

438
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,140
I understand you deeply,

439
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,580
but you cannot take over

440
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,540
this responsibility.

441
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,140
Maybe we have been worrying too much.

442
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,660
He would possibly memorize everything by

443
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,940
tomorrow morning.

444
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,700
Maybe...

445
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,260
I asked you to eat

446
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,300
not kill yourself.

447
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,220
Look at you,

448
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,500
how much you have gotten this weak.

449
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,740
When would you stop the resistance?

450
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,140
I would do whatever you say

451
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,220
only if you

452
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,620
let the princess go.

453
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,620
Grand Tutor,

454
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,330
please look at this world carefully.

455
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,800
Look at the cars on the road,

456
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,280
and the planes in the sky.

457
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,700
Think it through,

458
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,100
if we came up with all of these,

459
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,410
would it be very easy for us to exterminate the Ning Dynasty?

460
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,940
Then why would I trouble myself

461
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,090
to catch you and the princess.

462
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,260
Although my knowledge is limited,

463
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,740
I know that seeing is believing is not entirely true

464
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,900
in this world.

465
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,460
Mu,

466
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,940
please tell me what can I do to help.

467
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,220
I got nothing here.

468
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,420
Grand Tutor, can you tell me

469
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,940
how did you get this scar?

470
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,570
It is not written in the play about how you got this scar.

471
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,740
If you cannot tell immediately how you

472
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,740
got it.

473
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,140
It means Mu Yun is a imaginary character.

474
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,380
I was hurt by scissors.

475
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,610
Right, it was caused by scissors cut.

476
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,940
Mu, you have gotten your memories back?

477
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,860
My family was in straitened circumstances

478
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,180
when I was young,

479
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:16,980
I could only share a oil lamp with my mother

480
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,900
when night came.

481
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,140
I read in front of the desk and my mother

482
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,260
tailored and embroidered by my side.

483
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,620
The night fall early on that day,

484
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,890
my mother's eyesight was failing and

485
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,580
cut me accidentally with the scissors in her hand.

486
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,860
What about it?

487
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,020
Anything you want to say?

488
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,620
Well done, Mu.

489
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,060
One hell of a bibliography.

490
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,140
Nobody else can compete.

491
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,580
An endless play cannot demonstrate

492
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,330
a person's life.

493
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,620
You can only get to the princess

494
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,900
with such

495
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,500
despicable manners.

Whatever you think,

498
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,060
for me this scar is the witness of our friendship

499
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,330
between me and

500
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,570

Mate,

503
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,540
you must have earned a lot of money by acting.

504
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,980
Sharing some money with us

505
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,220
should not be a problem, right?

506
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,260
Your senior is speaking to you, you cannot hear?

507
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,540
Wait for your butt to be kicked later.

508
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,780
Why are you standing there?

509
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,490
Let's run!

510
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,060
-Go after them! -Let's go!

Stop running!

Stop there!

Mu Tingzhou,

if it was not for what you did,

528
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,900

I owe you.

533
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,700
become an entertainment agent for you?

534
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,420
What is entertainment agent?

535
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,490
It's your house steward.

536
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,900
If I were Mu Tingzhou,

537
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,180
I must have became enemies

with you after this,

539
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,500
and asked you to stay away from me.

540
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,540

541
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,140
are still saying you are not him?

Grand Tutor,

543
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,450
have you ever thought that

544
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,620
if everything we said is true,

545
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,100
if you are really confused by your memories?

546
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,740
Have you ever thought

547
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,010
that everything in this world

548
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,290
including you and me are

549
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,900
living in the delusion and

550
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,900
not knowing about it.

551
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,620
I just wake up ahead of all of you

552
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,740
and find out I am Mu Yun,

553
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,890
not Mu Tingzhou.

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,460
Even there is only one in ten million of the chance,

555
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,380
I would rather believe my own inference.

556
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,580
If people cannot even believe themselves,

557
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,580
they would live in fears

558
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,220
and cannot have a peaceful life.

559
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,220
Never mind, never mind...

I would like to hear about that.

566
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,860
From now on,

567
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,860
we will treat you as Grand Tutor Mu.

568
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,340
But in exchange,

569
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,860
I want you to believe that

570
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,100
you are taken by an invisible power

571
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,210
to a few hundred years later.

572
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,460
Stop treating us with this hostile attitude,

573
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,460
will you?

574
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,980
What's my interests?

575
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,380
Under this circumstance,

576
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,060
I assure you I can do my best to satisfy

577
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,060
your need.

578
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,900
Let me leave this place immediately

579
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,220
and give me a place to live in alone.

580
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,700
No more restrictions to my freedom.

581
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,020
No problem.

582
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,860
And most importantly,

583
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,700
I want to keep in touch with the princess at any time

584
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,020
to protect her by myself.

585
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,500
This...

586
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,100
Ming Wei.

587
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,980
Here, take a seat.

588
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,100
What would you like to drink?

589
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,660
A cup of coffee, please.

590
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,580
Okay.

591
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,610
Ming Wei.

592
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,420
I will say it directly.

593
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,020
Tingzhou needs your help very much now.

594
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,420
I hope you can change your mind

595
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,810
and help him.

596
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
If there are other things that I can do

597
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,340
I will do.

598
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,620
But...

599
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,420
I understand.

600
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Actually I agree with what

601
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,140
you said at the hospital.

602
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,340
This is the same way as injecting morphine.

603
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,020
And it can't cure the root of the disease

604
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,500
but fueling his addiction.

605
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,140
But Tingzhou's condition

606
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,620
is unusual.

607
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,300
There are no precedents.

608
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,780
No one can assure

609
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,660
which way is helpful for him,

610
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,620
right?

611
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,490
Before you refuse again,

612
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,580
please take a look at this first.

613
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,170
[I was born with a low social status, I do not dare to have relationship with you.]

614
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,020
This is after Tingzhou's accident

615
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,820
what I found in his notebook.

616
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,540
It is written the

617
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,540
notes of every show of yours.

618
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,980
[Princess Ming Hua was looking at him boldly.]

619
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,820
Has he ever shown this to you?

620
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,480
[Script Note]

621
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,340
These are the notes he took for me.

622
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Why wouldn't he show me

623
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,340
or tell me about it?

624
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,380
Tingzhou is just like this.

625
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,610
Many people said he is cold

626
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,500
and unkind.

627
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,500
But that is because

628
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,170
few people can enter his heart.

629
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,420
Now

630
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,620
I don't want to hide it from you.

631
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,020
Tingzhou has done many things for you.

632
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,219
But he is unwilling to tell you.

633
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,860
When you shot the scene of Grand Tutor leaving the capital,

634
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
In order to help you immerse into the emotion,

635
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,380
he deliberately ignore you at the scene.

636
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,739
What happened today?

637
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,540
What is wrong?

638
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,420
You offend him?

639
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,889
How dare I?

640
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,780
Later, you were upset because of Cheng Yao.

641
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,100
He asks a leave for you from the director

642
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,820
to help you resolve the problem.

[Script Note]

644
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,380
Did you know

645
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,140
why would the Grand Tutor forget about the following plots?

646
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,940
The doctor said

647
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,500
that is because he is unwilling to accept the ending that

648
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,780
the princess committed suicide.

649
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,340
The death of princess

650
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,780
is his scar for life.

651
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,260
None of us would

652
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,900
put the pressure of helping him to recover his memory on you.

653
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,420
We just hope he will not close himself again.

654
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,700
Even if

655
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,820
it means he has to be the Grand Tutor for life.

656
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,500
It is still much better than to be

657
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,220
a mute man who does not talk for life.

[At this stage, the psychological status of Princess Ming Hua has slight difference with that at the beginning of the story.]

660
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,620
At this stage,

661
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,380
compared with at the beginning of the story,

662
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,690
Princess Ming Hua has some emotional changes.

663
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,220
She is no longer the princess who has nothing to worry about.

664
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,820
She is filled with love.

665
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,380
And at the same time, the complexity in the court

666
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,940
makes her more mature.

667
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,260
It is me.

668
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,540
Mr. Mu, we are ready

Free of charge. Free of charge.

684
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,780
I thought we have agreed not to do this.

685
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,460
Right.

this is already a quite commodious room here.

It is fine, it is fine.

Your Highness, do you live here alone?

696
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,660
I am with my sister.

697
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,900
She lives with me.

00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,300
I have told you.

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,660
how could you let her tailor her own clothes and burn wood?

You are mistaken.

It is not that hard as Mr. Mu has imagined.

726
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,300
Your Highness lives a hard life without knowing it which

727
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,620
makes me even more ashamed.

Don't do this, don't do this.

Grand Tutor, how about this?

733
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,020
I could ask Tingzhou's nanny Auntie Zhao

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,180
to take care of everything for Your Highness.

735
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,300
What do you think about this?

00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,180
No need.

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,820
I should take care of Your Highness by myself.
