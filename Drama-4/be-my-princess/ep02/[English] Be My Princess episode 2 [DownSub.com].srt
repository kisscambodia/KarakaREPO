Our people are displaced

6
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,020

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,620
I can consider teaching you in my free time,

11
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,620
but first,

12
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,500
you have to show your sincerity.

13
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,780
What are you referring to?

14
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,780
Why...why is he coming so close?

15
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,900
It can't be what I'm thinking, right?

16
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,980
The unspoken rules.

17
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,820
I was reading the tabloid the other day,

18
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,060
and it said that the crews

19
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,740
might have unspoken rules.

20
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,370
It might be a rumor.

21
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,450
But you need to keep alert.

22
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,140
Don't come any closer.

23
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,420
Any closer and I'd kick you!

24
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,780
What do you think?

25
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,220
I think,

26
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,650
as an actor,

27
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,330
the best sincerity

28
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,980
is to do your job well.

29
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,180
To better understand your character,

30
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,580
and generate chemistry with other actors.

31
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,060
I hope your performance

32
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,580
makes our one month waiting worth it.

33
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,020
Rest assured, Mr. Mu.

34
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,810
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

35
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,020
I'll give you one day

36
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,540
to prove your worth.

37
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,530
Mr. Mu,

38
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,820
what did you mean by that?

39
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,860
If you act badly,

40
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,500
you'd still be replaced.

41
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,260
You'll never get the chance

42
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,980
to act again.

43
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,970
Good night.

44
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,940
If you act badly,

45
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,540
you'd still be replaced.

46
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,380
After that,

47
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,050
it'll be very difficult for you to act again.

48
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,380
Good night.

49
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,850
I'm speechless.

50
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,330
Who do you think you are?

51
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,900
The Jade Emperor, or Buddha?

52
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,820
You really think you're the Grand Tutor.

53
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,210
You think my fate

54
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,820

55
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,260
Although

56
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,860
I didn't want to be in the limelight,

57
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,860
if I'm fired like this,

58
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,460
that's too embarrassing.

59
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,610

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,620
Get them back,

64
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,060

I don't care.

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,410
You have to catch them for me!

72
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,580

Ming Wei, you're here early.

We're starting late today,

81
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,620
so why don't you sleep more?

82
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,530
Soon there will be enough to tire you out.

83
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,380
I'm not early,

84
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,660
not as early as Mr. Mu.

85
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,010
No matter which crew Mr. Mu is in,

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,140
he's always the role model.

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,100

We didn't even finish one scene this morning.

122

and delay the progress,

126
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,860
how should I explain to the production manager?

Fine.

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,940
I know you feel terrible now.

But whatever happens

134
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,570
you need to be relaxed.

135
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,090
The more nervous you are, the more likely you will fail.

136
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,380
I feel bad.

137
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,090
Come on, let's eat over there.

138
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,380
Squatting here is not good for your digestion.

139

Come.

140
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,570

It's quite delicious.

147
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,940
Actually, it's quite normal for you

148
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,100
to feel nervous when you act for the first time.

149
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,740
It's totally fine. Don't think too much about it.

150
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,940
Let's eat.

151
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,010
You don't know about my first acting experience.

152
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,020
That is really something embarrassing.

153
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,900
There was a line in the script.

154
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,210
"We are so anxious

155
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,540
like big eyes staring at small eyes."

156
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,820
At that time

157
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,140
I was so nervous

158
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,850
that I said

159
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,020
"we are so anxious

160
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,700
like left eye staring at right eye."

161
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,540
Everyone at the scene burst out laughing.

162
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,660
The director even said,

163
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,460
"Come on. Show us

164
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,340
how to use your left eye to stare at your right eye."

165
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,540
I was in a devil of a hole.

166
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,540
I was too nervous at that time.

167
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,460
The more nervous you are, the more likely you will fail.

168
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,820
Actually, I think you act quite well.

169
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,900
The expressions in your eyes, those small details

170
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,130
were really good.

171
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,060
Maybe it's just because you are unfamiliar with the environment.

172
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,780
You can't fully express yourself.

173
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,420
Thank you.

174
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,780
I just

175
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,060
really didn't know what to do.

176
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,420
It's my pleasure.

177
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,540
Mr. Mu

178
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,220
is really good at acting.

179
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
I am quite jealous of you to have the opportunity

180
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,220
to learn from him.

181
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,580
You should cheer up.

182
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,980
You can do this.

183
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,860
Come on.

184
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,620
Come on.

185
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,900
Hurry up, it's getting cold.

186
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,940
Look at Chen Zhang.

187
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,340
He made Ming Wei smile only by a few words.

188
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,860
You shouldn't be always so serious.

189
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,660
Don't give her too much pressure.

190
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,770
So you blame me for her poor performance?

191
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,980
Of course.

192
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,100
Who would not be nervous to work with the Best Actor for the first time?

193
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,820
Let alone Ming Wei is just a novice.

194
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,140
You should take care of her.

195
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,940
I don't think a novice needs to be taken care of.

196
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,140
As long as you are an actor

197
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,530
you should set high standards for yourself.

198
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,420
There are no exceptions.

199
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,780
Boring.

200
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,060
Hello?

201
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,060
Sister,

202
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,820
how is your acting going?

203
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,940
Not good.

204
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,370
I am on the verge

205
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,900
of being kicked out of the crew.

206
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,140
Who is trying to kick you out?

207
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,300
Tell me, I will handle it for you.

208
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,860
You can't handle this for me.

209
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
I have to rely on myself.

210
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
Tell me.

211
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,400
I am getting anxious.

212
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,380
What happened?

213
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,220
Mu Tingzhou gave me one day

214
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,580
to let me prove my ability

215
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,020
or I will be out.

216
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,220
Mu Tingzhou.

217
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,490
He thought he was famous

218
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,530
so he could push you around?

219
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,450
He didn't push me around.

220
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,700
It was me who didn't perform well.

221
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,020
But his entertainment agent was quite nice.

222
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,099
Very kind.

223
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,099
Xiao Zhao?

224
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,740
Yes, you know him?

225
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,810
Yeah.

226
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,619
The grapevine talks about him all the time.

227
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,220
He's from a wealthy family.

228
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,500
But sis,

229
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,690
this guy

230
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,540
is nice to every girl,

231
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
like a central air-conditioner.

232
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,660
Don't get fooled by his kindness.

233
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,500
I know that. Don't worry.

234
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,060
Sister, was acting interesting?

235
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,700
Can I visit you when I am free?

236
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,020
Of course.

237
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,370
Just call me

238
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,860
whenever you don't have classes.

239
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,020
Qiao, I have to go.

240
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,180
I've got something to do, goodbye.

241
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,220
Mr. Xiao.

242
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,900
Ming Wei.

243
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,100
What's the matter?

244
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,410
I have a question about acting

245
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,780
that I would like to ask Mr. Mu.

246
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,490
Could you please give me his number?

247
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,270
Sorry.

248
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,460
Do you recognize my acting?

249
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,020
No.

250
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,580
I will leave the crew tomorrow morning.

251
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,130
You don't want to act anymore?

252
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,980
You said I was a poor actress

253
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,020
and you don't want me to act for the show, right?

254
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,620
Now you ask me if I want to act.

255
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,620
Of course I want to act,

256
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,060
but you won't let me continue.

257
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,780
So I'll leave.

258
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,460
I really don't recognize

259
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,700
your acting.

260
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,940
But you have talent.

261
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,500
If you put your heart into it,

262
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,000
the character you perform

263
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,780
probably can make the audience get connected with you.

264
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,770
I could teach you some acting skills

265
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,260
at some appropriate time.

266
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,540
So

267
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,980
I agree to let you stay.

268
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,540
Really?

269
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,500
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

270
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,860
I will leave you some homework. Take it seriously.

271
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,930
What homework?

272
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,180
After the day work, you should

273
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,180
go over the parts you will act the next day

274
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,100
according to your schedule.

275
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,180
Understand the character from your view

276
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,940
to go deep into the character's inner world.

277
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,860
Apart from your understanding of Princess Ming Hua,

278
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,780
you should also try to understand

279
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,330
other characters.

280
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,740
Write down your thoughts to

281
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
express your understanding in words.

282
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,900
I will give it to you as soon as I finish.

283
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,580
The homework is not for me.

284
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,780
You don't need to hand it to me.

285
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,450
It's only for you to better understand the characters.

286
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,100
I will take it seriously.

287
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,410
How come he always doesn't have a good ending?

288
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,210
We have more acting work

289
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
in the latter part.

290
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,380
No problem.

291
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,260
You told my room number to Ming Wei?

292
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,140
Why would I bother to do that?

293
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,570
But you are in the same crew

294
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,660
and you are colleagues.

295
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,220
It's quite normal to have your room number.

296
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,620
I can't be with you all the time.

297
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,050
What kind of entertainment agent you are!

298
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,140
Tell me,

299
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,660
when did you come back last night?

300
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,340
Why? Are you spying on me?

301
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,380
I don't want you to get into trouble.

302
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,420
Everybody, it's time for lunch.

303
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,340
We'll go back to work after lunch.

304
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,540
Thank you.

305
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,340
Ming Wei.

306
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,180
Come. We have tasty fried meat today.

307
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,260
I've got yours.

308
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,700
Thanks.

310
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,670
Have a seat.

311
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,600
Here you go.

314
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,330
These chopsticks.

315
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,180
I've prepared these for you.

316
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:04,850
From today on,

317
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,700
you could eat with me here

318
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,710
and have a rest.

319
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,390
Thanks.

320
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,620
Let's eat.

321
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,230
Try this.

322
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,290
Thanks.

323
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,870
Look at them,

324
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,850
a man and a woman eating together.

325
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,480
And me,

326
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
eating with a man everyday.

327
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,270
It really spoils my appetite.

328
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,500
I could give you a box of Laoganma Chili Sauce,

329
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,970
then you'll have a good appetite.

330
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,220
Do you think

331
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,530
the consort will take it seriously and make the drama become true?

332
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,000
It's none of your business.

333
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,550
No, it's not mine.

334
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,810
But it's yours.

335
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,080
I thought you would be unhappy.

336
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,550
You know about it.

337
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,100
I never fall in love with a colleague.

338
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,240
It's stupid.

339
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,050
Don't brag yet.

340
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,400
You might eat your words.

341
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,430
Do I look good?

342
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,150
You're more beautiful than the fairy, Your Highness.

343
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,830
Over there, Your Highness.

344
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,830
This way, Grand Tutor.

345
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
The princess is admiring flowers here.

346
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,100
Who are you?

347
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm Mu Yun,

348
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,370
Your Highness.

349
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,810
You've scared away my butterfly.

350
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,280
You must compensate me for another one.

351
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,330
Otherwise,

352
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,510
I won't let you go.

353
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,570
Why don't you move?

354
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,630
The butterfly was scared away by Eunuch Li.

355
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,480
I shouldn't take the blame for that.

356
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,050
You're guilty if I say so.

357
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,150
Go get me a butterfly.

358
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,070
Cut.

359
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,980
Everybody did a good job today.

360
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,840
Especially Ming Wei. You made big progress today.

361
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,070
Thanks, director. Thanks, director.

00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,710

Mr. Mu.

365
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,580
Is there any problem?

366
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,520
I'm looking at the upcoming scenes.

367
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,320
I feel like sometimes

368
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,960
you have to keep a steady pace,

369
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,050
hit that emotion right on point,

370
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,610
and pay attention to the details.

must learn.

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,030
Ten pages?

380
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,670
But I want to play outside.

381
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,220
Your Highness lives in the palace

382
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,260
and should know rites and social forms

383
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,400
so that you set a good example for thousands of your people.

384
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,620
It's your responsibility.

385
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,470
How could you say you wouldn't learn it?

386
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,870
I didn't say that.

387
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,060
Your Highness.

388
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,860
Grand Tutor.

389
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,510
You may arise.

390
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,060
What is that?

391
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,040
His Majesty really loves his daughter.

392
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,430
He rewards you this facial mud cleanser.

393
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,150
Please send him my appreciation for this.

394
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,970
Your Highness, I'll leave you be.

395
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,760
Your Highness.

396
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,130
Grand Tutor, do you think

397
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,510
if I would become more beautiful

398
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,280
if I use this facial mud cleanser?

399
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,830
Your Highness is the daughter of His Majesty.

400
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,850
You were born with natural beauty.

401
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,530
Come.

402
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,750
Finish these ten pages first.

403
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,240
I don't want to.

404
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,880
I still want to play outside.

405
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,240
Today is the Firework Festival.

406
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,120
Do you still remember?

407
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,570
I heard it is so much fun when it's Firework Festival.

408
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,580
I was wondering if

409
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,680
I could get out before the gate is closed.

410
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,720
I know it might be inappropriate.

411
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,020
But,

412
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,200
how could a princess set a good example for her people if she

413
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,690
always lives in the palace and doesn't know

414
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,640
what her people are worried about

415
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,440
or what they are happy about?

416
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,140
Grand Tutor,

417
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,030
am I right?

418
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,380
Finish these ten pages, then you may go.

419
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,600
After study,

420
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,990
I'll report to His Majesty

421
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,840
that I shall go with you.

422
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,180
Grand Tutor, it's amazing.

423
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,440
Your Highness, how's that? Is it beautiful?

424
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,330
Yes, it is!

425
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,710
It's so much fun.

426
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,840
[Fragrant Tea]

427
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
Miss, take a look here.

428
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,130
It's fun.

429
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,560
My Lady, don't.

430
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,000
Come and take a look!

431
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,200
Such a disappointment to come

432
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,880
out with them!

433
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,830
It's all for your safety, Your Highness.

434
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,140
Am I not safe enough to be with you?

435
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,330
You will take care of me,

436
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,590
right?

437
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,570
Of course.

438
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,340
Let's go!

439
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,910
Finally got rid of them!

440
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,150
Your Highness, you....

441
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,020
You have transgressed the bounds of decency.

442
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,640
What did you say?

443
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,650
-Watch out, Your Highness! -Come and catch me!

444
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,500
Catch me, quickly!

445
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,470
Don't run, sister!

446
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,680
Wait for me, sister!

447
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,360
Your Highness, as your minister, I just reminded you that

448
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,110
You have transgressed the bounds of decency.

449
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:47,540
[Dressing Room]

450
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,310
Tingzhou, you are really going to treat Ming Wei like this?

451
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,400
Is it going to work?

452
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,370
Shut up!

453
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,560
Mr. Mu and Mr. Xiao, good morning!

454
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,940
Morning!

455
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,030
You don't have to care about him,

456
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,460
he is like this when he thinks about the plots.

457
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,710
What is his deal?

458
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,449
Ming Wei,

459
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,340
for this plot,

460
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:13,780
you still need to show the effeminacy and innocence as the princess.

461
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,980
Even her caprice.

462
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,489
But deep inside your heart,

463
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,820
you care about the Grand Tutor.

464
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,620
So you should have dissatisfaction and grievances

465
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,179
in your emotions.

466
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,699
Of course you should also feel reluctant to leave.

467
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:24,870
Do you understand?

468
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,050
Yes, director.

469
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,310
Tingzhou,

470
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,870
your role has already realized that he starts

471
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,389
to have feelings at this time.

472
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,250
So you would ask to leave the capital.

473
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,929
No problem, right?

474
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,610
Alright.

475
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,449
Please rehearse the lines with Ming Wei later to

476
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,340
help her understand better.

477
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,199
What's wrong with him today?

478
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,790
What's going on?

479
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,469
Did you mess with him?

480
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,159
How dare I?

481
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,180
Why don't you talk to me?

482
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,690
How could you leave without saying goodbye?

483
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,860
Your Highness, you have come to set me off.

484
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,990
I really don't deserve such an honor.

485
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,840
It is not a good place to stay.

486
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,070
Your Highness, it is better for you to go back to the palace as soon as possible.

487
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,790
Why would you go to the North?

488
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,280
Father said,

489
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,170
it is your own decision.

490
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,940
Is it true?

491
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,620
The country is not stable without ruling the North.

492
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,090
It is my own decision to garrison the North.

493
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,560
How long will you be gone?

494
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,160
When will you come back to the capital?

495
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,650
Please take care, Your Highness.

496
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,450
Grand Tutor,

497
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,060
no matter how long you will be gone,

498
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,950
I will be waiting for you.

499
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,570
Your Highness, you have offered an inappropriate present.

500
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,590
I cannot take it.

501
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,930
It is not an inappropriate present.

502
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,070
I am not going to come back to the capital.

503
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,590
Your Highness, you don't have to wait.

504
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,780
His Majesty will hire a new tutor for you.

505
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,380
You are not only a tutor

506
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,330
to me.

507
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,720
To me,

508
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,860
Your Highness, you are just my student.

509
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,120
Come on!

510
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,170
Cut!

511
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,010
Very good, very good!

512
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,490
Ming Wei's emotions are very realistic.

513
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,470
You have demonstrated the grievances and dissatisfaction of the princess

514
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,730
right on point.

515
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,410
Good job, Ming Wei!

516
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,210
Let's switch the set up!

517
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,380
Great move!

518
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,710
He really deserves to be the best actor.

519
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,510
Please pass it to me.

520
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,390
Thank you.

521
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,230
You are welcome.

522
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,470
Your boyfriend is here to visit you?

523
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,260
Ex-boyfriend.

524
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,310
Let me give a brief introduction to you.

525
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,740
This is the main scene of the TV series,

526
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,090
the imperial garden.

527
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,270
We have filmed most of our

528
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,110
plots here.

529
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,810
To be honest, in order to build this scene at that time...

530
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,610
What are you thinking?

531
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,070
I have went through the documents of

532
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,890
architectures and gardens from that era.

533
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,640
Nothing.

534
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,540
It is said that this Mr. Cheng

535
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,350
has invested a lot of money to our crew.

536
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,650
He is a well-known rich princeling who

537
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,040
invests films and TV shows to

538
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,630
chase after actresses.

539
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,730
Let the audiences

540
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,000
to experience that era.

541
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,020
Come, Mr. Cheng. Please come this way.

542
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,200
You know each other?

543
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:46,920
He just smiled at you,

544
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,720
didn't he?

545
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,320
I don't know him.

546
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,210
A guy like him must

547
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,100
smile at

548
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,280
all the young actresses.

549
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,710
Fair enough.

550
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,950
Ming Wei, as a rookie,

551
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,040
you have to be very careful.

552
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,720
Don't let people take advantage of your words.

553
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,080
I know, thank you.

554
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,570
[Cheng Yao.]

555
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,710
Wei, I am looking forward to seeing you at the dinner party.

556
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,710
Do you have anything to do

557
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,430
with me being nominated as the heroine?

558
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,610
I will tell you in person tonight.

559
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,910
The banquet is going to start,

560
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,960
you are really not going to show up?

561
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,110
You know I don't attend

562
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,500
meaningless social events.

563
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,950
An event which is organized by so many sneaky investors

564
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,420
down there.

565
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,850
Ming Wei is so pretty and innocent.

566
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,130
You really don't care that they might take a move on her?

567
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,410
Why would I care?

568
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,610
Enjoy your meal.

569
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,140
Alright, we will go first.

570
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,020
OK, OK.

571
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,580
-Let's go, there. -Alright.

572
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,190
Thanks for your work.

573
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,870
It is not easy to succeed this year

574
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,870
in this environment.

575
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,810
Miss Ming!

576
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,210
Hello, hello.

577
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:53,760
Hello.

578
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,110
Hello.

579
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,680
This is the heroine Miss Ming, right?

580
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,070
Stunning as expected.

581
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,260
Miss Ming is surely a heavenly beauty.

582
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,100
I don't know if you can come

583
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,080
to our company in the future.

584
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,800
Ming Wei,

585
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,440
I haven't seen you for a long time.

586
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,160
You have become more beautiful.
