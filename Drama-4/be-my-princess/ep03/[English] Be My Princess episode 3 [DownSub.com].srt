In the seventh year of Tianshuo, the Emperor passed away.

A Vassal King rose in rebellion, colluding with the Imperial Guards, and took over the capital with ease.

Resident General Mu Yun in the northern frontier came back to the capital to rescue the princess.

Where is the princess?

00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,180
I don't know.

13
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,180
Mr. Li, don't forget me if there is a new script.

14
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,820
Director, let's talk inside.

15
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,860
OK. We should leave now.

16
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,020
OK. Bye.

17
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,020
Come on. Let's go.

18
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,700
OK.

19
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,140
Thanks for your hard work.

20
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,780
It's not easy to get things done, considering this year's situation.

21
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,740
Miss Ming.

22
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,060
Hello.

23
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,020
-Hello. -Hello.

24
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,290
Hello.

25
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,380
This must be the leading lady Miss Ming, right?

26
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,940
As expected, you are stunning.

27
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,180
Miss Ming really is a natural beauty.

28
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,820
I'm wondering if you can

29
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,980
sign a contract with my company in the future.

30
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,180
Ming Wei,

31
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,980
long time no see.

32
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,540
You look more beautiful.

33
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,380
So Mr. Cheng is here too.

34
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Of course I should be here.

35
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,180
Mr. Chen,

36
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,660
let's go get a drink.

37
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,420
Right. Let's go.

38
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,180
Excuse me for a second.

39
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:33,980
OK.

40
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,140
Let's go.

41
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,330
Tell me.

42
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,620
Does me being admitted to the crew have anything to do with you?

43
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,300
It's been a while since we last met.

44
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,620
No need to rush.

45
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,740
Let's take a seat,

46
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
and I'll tell you after we go inside.

47
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,820
Come.

48
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,540
Let's go.

49
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,100
Mr. Mu.

50
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,060
Hello, Mr. Mu.

51
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm Cheng Yao of Zhenghua Group.

52
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,420
Nice to meet you again.

53
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,450
Hi there.

54
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,020
Mr. Mu, why are you here?

55
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,420
I can't be here?

56
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,860
That's not what I meant.

57
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,300
Mr. Mu,

58
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,660
I heard that you are not a fan of such occasions.

59
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,100
We are so happy

60
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,900
you are here today.

61
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,090
Let's go.

62
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,820
Let's go.

63
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,370
Here. Have a drink.

64
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,300
Wishing us success.

65
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
Ming Wei, here.

66
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,050
Don't eat that.

67
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,620
You won't get any jobs if you gain more weight.

68
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,780
Oh right. Have you finished

69
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,340
the homework I left you?

70
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,340
If you haven't,

71
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,420
leave now.

72
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,420
Mr. Mu, let's go now.

73
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,580
Sorry guys.

74
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,820
I have something on, so I have to go now.

75
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,730
Director, excuse me.

76
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,340
Sorry, director.

77
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,500
I have homework to do.

78
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,780
Mr. Mu.

79
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,660
Ming Wei is a girl.

80
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,770
What you just said

81
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,500
is a little disrespectful, don't you think?

82
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,140
In my opinion,

83
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,580
to show true respect to girls

84
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,140
is to not deceive them emotionally

85
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,420
or disturb their lives.

86
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,260
What do you say?

87
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,020
Let's go.

88
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,380
Mr. Mu, thank you.

89
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,340
It's true that actresses can encounter

90
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,770
disgusting people and things on some occasions.

91
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,300
You should learn to protect yourself

92
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,540
and know when to say no.

93
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,300
OK. I'll be careful.

94
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,180
Remember to go through tomorrow's scenes

95
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,620
and do your homework when you get home.

96
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,020
Don't be affected

97
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,900
by a loser like that guy.

98
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,620
Don't worry.

99
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,340
Wei, I'll wait for you in the lobby.

100
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,420
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

101
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,460
Wei.

102
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,580
Answer my question directly.

103
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,940
This can wait.

104
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,300
Wei, I...

105
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,100
I want to tell you that

106
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,049
I miss you so much, Wei.

107
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,850
What's the truth about the investment?

108
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,179
Don't get mad.

109
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,539
I never intended to tell you.

110
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,300
I just wanted to take this opportunity

111
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,260
to get close to you

112
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,580
and get you back.

113
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,180
What's more, I don't want to see Wang Yingying

114
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,860
behaving so arrogantly in front of you.

115
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,330
So

116
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,260
the reason why I got this role

117
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,900
is your investment.

118
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,940
I admit that there is selfishness

119
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,740
in my investment.

120
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,060
But everybody knows your professionalism.

121
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,100
My investment was just an additional guarantee.

122
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,730
I need to

123
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,860
think about this seriously.

124
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,380
I should go now.

125
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,380
Ming Wei.

126
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,060
Let me go.

127
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,660
After I make a decision,

128
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,660
I will let you know.

129
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,620
I didn't expect to see something so exciting

130
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,420
during a night run.

131
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,060
It seems that Ming Wei won't be able to sleep tonight.

132
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,780
If I leave,

133
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,930
not only will the crew's progress be affected,

134
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,620
I would also feel very sorry.

135
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,500
Besides, I can't afford to pay

136
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,220
the penalty fees.

137
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,980
However, if I don't leave,

138
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,700
Cheng Yao will haunt me.

139
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,740
What should I do?

140
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,330
OK, that's fine, let's roll.

141
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,180
Clapperboard please.

142
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,100
Slate it.

143
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,810
Episode 13, Scene 8.

144
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,020
Ready, action.

145
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,300
I ask myself

146
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,420
if I can make decisions about this minor issue myself.

147
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,180
This is a minor issue?

148
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,780
Cut.

149
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,100
Ming Wei,

150
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,420
For this scene,

151
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,010
the princess's anger should be the focus.

152
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,140
Why are you being sombre?

153
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,810
You have to get into your head

154
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,060
that the princess is only 17 here.

155
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,260
She's like a young girl in high school.

156
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,740
We have done this for three times.

157
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,300
Your emotions are still off.

158
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,180
Give it some thought. We will shoot again later.

159
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,940
Sorry director. I will think about it.

160
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,580
Director.

161
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,500
Why don't we shoot

162
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,780
my part in the morning?

163
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,660
Alright.

164
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,140
That gives you half a day

165
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,740
to think it through before filming.

166
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,340
Thank you director.

167
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,860
Sorry, Mr. Mu.

168
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,300
Cheng Yao.

169
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,300
What is the meaning of this?

170
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,260
Wei,

171
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
after last night,

172
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,420
I kept waiting for you to contact me.

173
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,580
You said you wanted to meet today,

174
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,260
so I prepared this immediately.

175
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,540
Wei, believe me.

176
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,260
We will be happy together from now on.

177
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,780
I will surround you with love.

178
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,180
I won't allow you to suffer any more grievances.

179
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,260
Cheng Yao, I think you misunderstood me.

180
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,530
I will give you every cent I make from this show.

181
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,820
After the filming wraps,

182
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,170
I will leave the entertainment industry for good.

183
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,260
Wei,

184
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,530
I don't want your pay.

185
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,020
I just want to be with you.

186
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,770
I didn't realize that this issue would cause

187
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,980
you so much stress.

188
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,340
You really don't have to do this.

189
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,540
There are so many others who get in through the back door.

190
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,580
Why make things difficult for yourself?

191
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,860
My conscience won't be clear,

192
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,220
so

193
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,540
I can't accept this.

194
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,220
But

195
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,180
this is not your fault.

196
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,690
Mr. Cheng,

197
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,860
I have to reject your kind intentions.

198
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,220
Send me your bank account number later.

199
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,940
Goodbye.

200
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,100
Hello miss.

201
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,660
Are you alone?

202
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,540
This way please.

203
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,460
Alright, thank you.

204
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,660
Mushroom pasta.

205
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,570
-Alright. -Thank you.

206
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,460
Ming Wei,

207
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,090
Eating alone?

208
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,540
Mr. Xiao, Mr. Mu.

209
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,820
Tingzhou and I have been walking around.

210
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,580
This restaurant seems less crowded,

211
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,660
so we walked in.

212
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,940
Why don't we sit together?

213
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,940
I have been meaning to thank Mr. Mu.

214
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,260
Give me the chance to treat you two

215
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,660
to a meal today.

216
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,530
Sure, I have no problem with that.

217
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,060
What about you, Tingzhou?

218
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,740
Thank you.

219
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,510
Thank you.

220
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
One beef burger.

221
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,770
One seafood baked rice.

222
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,450
Thank you.

223
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,500
Sorry to pry, Miss Ming.

224
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,620
You don't seem to be in a good mood today.

225
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,900
Is something bothering you?

226
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,580
I thought that

227
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,460
I had luck and some talent,

228
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,140
so even when I faced doubts,

229
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,860
I persevered.

230
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,890
But yesterday, I found out that

231
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,700
I'm actually a beneficiary of nepotism.

232
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,420
Then what right do I have

233
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,180
to keep troubling everyone

234
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,580
to help me and tolerate me?

235
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,700
I thought of exiting the crew,

236
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,300
but I'm worried that will affect the overall progress of the crew.

237
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,340
Besides,

238
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,980
I really can't afford the penalty fees.

239
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,180
I have caused you a lot of trouble during this period.

240
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,660
Sorry.

241
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,060
Sit down, let's talk about this slowly.

242
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,410
Sit down.

243
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,099
How do you intend to repay

244
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,339
Cheng Yao's favor?

245
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,420
Do you really intend to get back together with him?

246
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,849
That's impossible.

247
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,660
Although I got in because of Cheng Yao,

248
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,140
that can't be helped now.

249
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,220
I will do my best

250
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,580
and give him every cent of my pay.

251
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,780
After the filming wraps,

252
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,540
I will leave the entertainment industry.

253
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,140
Miss Ming, you may not know this.

254
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,260
When the production team was choosing the female lead,

255
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,220
the director wanted to pick

256
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,850
a more experienced actress.

257
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,820
It was Tingzhou who stood up for you.

258
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,350
Ms. Shen,

259
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,180
I'm really sorry.

260
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,200
I know you recommended her.

261
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,380
But having a rookie play the lead

262
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,740
will put too much pressure on the production team.

263
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,940
Mr. Mu, am I right?

264
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,540
[Ming Wei]

265
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,500
[Ming Wei]

266
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,140
I suggest...

267
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,900
Why don't we try

268
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,660
the rookie?

269
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,580
I just felt that

270
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,180
your vibe was more suitable for the role.

271
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
It was not personal.

272
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,980
So last night, after we heard

273
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,580
what Cheng Yao said,

274
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,340
Tingzhou asked me to find out what happened

275
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,780
from Dongying Group's Mr. Lu.

276
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,860
Cheng Yao's investment in this show

277
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,820
has nothing to do with you being selected as the female lead.

278
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,580
Mr. Mu, I love you!

279
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,540
Rest assured, I will work hard.

280
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,860
Shouldn't you thank me?

281
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,060
What should I thank you for?

282
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Thank you for helping me take credit for what I did,

283
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,300
so I could get a huge from a girl

284
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,980
with the public watching?

285
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,700
Although you are the Best Actor,

286
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,980
your acting sucks now.

287
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,740
It's so obvious that you are really happy.

288
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,620
Yet you are still pretending,

289
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,860
acting like you don't want it.

290
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,300
Tingzhou,

291
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,770
you are being really coy right now.

292
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm sorry, I don't know what you are talking about.

293
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,260
All these years, besides Xu Lin, who grew up with us,

294
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,660
I have never seen you care

295
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,980
so deeply about any girl

296
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,530
as Ming Wei.

297
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,900
I have to study her character

298
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,820
and observe her

299
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,060
for your sake,

300
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,780
right?

301
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,700
In that case, I have to thank you

302
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,260
for worrying about my love life.

303
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,860
Honestly,

304
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,060
if you have so much time on your hands,

305
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,660
shouldn't you be worrying about yourself?

306
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,380
I won't bother you further.

307
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,900
I have a date.

308
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,220
After spending the day with you,

309
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,620
it's my private time now.

310
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,620
Don't contact me unless it's urgent.

311
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,620
This is the only route to attack the Huns.

312
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,460
I want to set up an ambush on both sides of the path.

313
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,140
Send 2,000 archers,

314
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,860
and use fire to attack.

315
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,380
This path protects the Ning dynasty.

316
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,050
Sir!

317
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,540
What makes you panic like this?

318
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,050
Here comes the demise of the crown.

319
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,420
Is the news accurate?

320
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,580
Yes, absolutely.

321
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,860
The Crown Prince is still young.

322
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,370
If any Vassal King plans to rebel,

323
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,100
you have to be prepared, your Majesty.

324
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,540
How are the Crown Prince and the Princess right now?

325
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,100
Hurry! Go in there.

326
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,340
Sister,

327
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,420
we go together.

328
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,740
Your Majesty, you're the Emperor now.

329
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,420
Your life is not just yours,

330
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,380
but belongs to the Ning Dynasty and your people.

331
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,500
Go inside, now!

332
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,620
Where is the Princess?

333
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,410
I don't know.

334
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,500
Tell me! Where is the young Emperor?

335
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,620
Where is he?

336
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,620
Tell me!

337
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,380
Grand Tutor,

338
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,780
I thought I would never see you again.

339
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,980
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

340
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,780
Sorry I'm late.

341
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,040
There you go.

342
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,620
Thank you.

343
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,460
Ming Wei,

344
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,500
you are very talented, actually.

345
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,580
As a new actress

346
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,540
who is on your first acting job,

347
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,780
you get hold of the emotions properly.

348
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,460
I was watching you on the side,

349
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,940
and I saw stories in your eyes.

350
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,380
It made me feel immersed.

351
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Actually I...

352
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,060
I just thought I was the Princess Ming Hua,

353
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,300
so I could get into the mood.

354
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,780
But I am telling you

355
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,740
you need to try separating your personal life

356
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,100
from your character,

357
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,620
or the upcoming scene will be heartbroken.

358
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,250
If you can't pull yourself out

359
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,580
and keep feeling down,

360
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,580
you will exhaust yourself.

361
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,060
There are lot of excellent actors

362
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,460
who stay in their roles for too long,

363
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,690
and they have physical and mental issues.

364
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,500
I don't want you to be like that.

365
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,570
You are right.

366
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,580
I know a bar nearby.

367
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,660
How about I take you out

368
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,500
and you can relax for a change.

369
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,380
That's alright.

370
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,180
You have a lot of work to do lately,

371
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,580
and you've been working hard.

372
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,770
Let's get the work done first.

373
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,900
Once the series is in the can,

374
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,700
the crew can get together and have a wrap party.

375
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,460
That would be so much fun.

376
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,980
Ming Wei,

377
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,180
I've been wanting to ask you something,

378
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,660
but please don't get mad.

379
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,740
Go ahead.

380
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,380
Well,

381
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,740
you and Mr. Cheng...

382
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,970
You two...?

383
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,170
It's my bad. I didn't make it clear.

384
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,180
There was a time

385
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,380
I dated him for a month,

386
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,140
but we broke up for some reasons later.

387
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,990
I asked you about him

388
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,580
only because I wanted to know his relationship with the crew.

389
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,820
Now I have solved the problem.

390
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,610
I'm sorry

391
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,170
for making you worried.

392
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,460
No problem.

393
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,340
If you're fine then I'm good, too.

394
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,660
Chen Zhang,

395
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,010
thank you.

396
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,930
Well, when you are at home, you depend on your parents; when you are outside, you rely on your friends.

397
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,940
How about this?

398
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,300
When you are acting here with the crew,

399
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,580
if you need any help,

400
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,570
just let me know anytime.

401
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,850
Even if I can't help you,

402
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,500
I can be

403
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,410
a good listener.

404
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,900
OK.

Now,

410
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,340
I should call you Chief Cabinet Minister.

411
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,620
If Your Highness agrees,

412
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,730
I will always be your Grand Tutor.

413
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,740
Grand Tutor,

414
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,700
you look tired.

415
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,410
And you've lost some weight.

418
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,940
It's just that I'm getting old.

419
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,220
No, it's not.

The Double Seventh Festival is right around the corner.

421
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,940
I heard there is a magic bridge in the town.

422
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,020
If you go and meet the person

423
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,060
that you like on that bridge on the day of the festival,

424
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,180
you two will get married.

425
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,260
Would you go with me

426
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,860
this year?

427
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,780
We can find out

428
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,220
how many couples will meet there.

429
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,100
Okay.

430
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,890

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,220
Come and have a seat.

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,980
Well done.

435
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,980
Do you guys have any thoughts

436
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,580
on the kissing scene the day after tomorrow?

437
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,410
Tingzhou,

438
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,500
I know that in your career,

439
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,660
you have never done a kissing scene.

440
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,780
But this time,

441
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,700
Ming Hua's character is kind of special.

442
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,300
The personality of the Princess

443
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,650
won't be consistent

444
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,380
if the kissing scene is deleted.

445
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,300
So

446
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,690
considering the coherence of the series,

447
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,340
we can't delete this scene.

448
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,780
Okay. No problem.

449
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,360
No worries, director.

450
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,740
I'm also cool with that, director.

451
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,860
Good. We will do it the day after tomorrow.

452
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,940
You two go have some rest now.

00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,860

Goodnight.

455
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,540
Thank you, director.

456
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,140
See you the day after tomorrow.

457
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,100
See you then.

This is for you.

460
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,140
What's this?

461
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,940
Don't you have a kissing scene soon?

462
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,300
I don't need it.

463
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,740
If they replace the leading actress,

464
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,740
would you still agree to do the kissing scene?

465
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,020
It's impossible to replace her.

466
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,140
Let's assume that...

467
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,580
Why assume that?

468
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,900
I'm only joking.

469
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,100
Why are you so serious?

470
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,340
Anyway, you definitely treat Ming Wei differently.

471
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,140
This is the first time you agreeing to do a kissing scene.

472
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,260
Hope you take the first step bravely,

473
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,570
so I will have more options when I look for acting jobs

for you in the future.

475
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,460
Oh, right,

476
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,900
since you have never been in a relationship,

477
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,090
do you need me to teach you some great dating skills?

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,540
No, I don't.

What are you up to?

485
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,690
I don't have anything on my schedule today.

486
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,740
Go somewhere with me.

we can't release our customers' information.

505

You could call her to pick you up.

Here's the thing,

507
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,500
I'd like to surprise her.

Of course, you're the golden entertainment agent.

515

And

516
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,850
you're an internet celebrity.

517
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,740
No. Don't say that.

518
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,590
I'm not an internet celebrity.

519
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,980
It's said that I am dissolute on the internet.

520
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,220
Well that's their guess.

521
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,180
I'm a decent and upright person.

522
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,780
Sure. Yes.

523
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,140
Right,

524
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,540

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,900
Not at all.

Good name.

541
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,620
So Ming Qiao,

542
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,890
do you want to take pictures with some celebrity,

543
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,620
or do you want to take a tour of the film studio?

544
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,460
Or,

545
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,460
do you want to try acting?

546
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,460
Can I do all of them?

547
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,380
No problem.

548
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,770
Let me take this parcel upstairs first.

549
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,020
Of course. Take your time.

550
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:46,770
Wait me for a while.

551
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,460
Sure.

552
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,380
How come he says he's decent and upright?

553
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,140
He looks like a playboy.

554
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,660
Mr. Mu.

555
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,380
What are we going to do here?

556
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,740
Kiss me.

557
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,300
Mister... Mr. Mu.

558
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,700
What's that supposed to mean?

559
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,220
Or what else

560
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,410
do you think we could do here?

561
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,540
It's deep in the wild

562
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,700
and there are only two of us, a man and a woman.

563
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,820
It's like dry wood and fierce fire.

564
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,100
Is it a special way for the Best Actor to pursue the love?

565
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,540
Don't be so fussy.

566
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,460
Let's get it done quickly.

567
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,700
No, it's out of the blue.

568
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,020
We haven't...

569
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,060
If we don't do the rehearsal,

570
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,850
how can we shoot the kissing scene?

571
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
The kissing scene.

572
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,180
We're going to shoot a kissing scene.

573
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,940
You're a novice and I need to help you rehearse

574
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,250
in case you delay the progress

575
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,930
when we're shooting.

576
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,020
So... So Mr. Mu was talking about the kissing scene

577
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,460
by saying "to provoke the emotions".

578
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,530
What are we supposed to do?

579
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,860
Stupid.

580
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,260
It's okay if you feel shy now.

581
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,100
But you have to concentrate when we shoot,

582
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,780
and take it seriously.

583
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,740
Nothing to feel shy about.

584
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,500
We're doing this for acting.

585
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,700
Alright, got it.

586
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,540
So you are not experienced at that.

587
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,820
You are just a paper-tiger.

588
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
You seems to be good at it,

589
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,420
but actually you feel shy about it.

590
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,060
We're good here.

591
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,500
I'm okay now.

592
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,260
Let's go.

593
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,220
Put your hands on the chin.

594
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,770
Smile. Smile.

595
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,140
A little bit more.

596
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,540
Tilt your head a little bit.

597
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,940
Tilt your head a little bit.

598
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,060
Good.

599
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,540
Three. Two. One.

600
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,900
Come. Check this out.

601
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,820
What a masterpiece.

602
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,660
Oh my gosh! You're really good at this.

603
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,740
How many girls have you taken photos for to get to this level?

604
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,660
What?

605
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,180
I'm kidding.

606
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,780
Sorry.

607
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,660
It's okay.

608
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,740
Alright. Dig in.

609
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,420
He's good at taking care of people.
