00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,930
This is...

194
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
This scumbag.

195
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,900
This is Miss Wang Yingying,

196
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,820
the heroine of

197
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,860
the recently popular TV series Phoenix Fly.

198
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,100
You should know her.

199
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,450
I have never watched it.

200
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,900
This is Miss Ming Wei,

201
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,020
our interpreter.

202
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,780
I didn't know interpreters are so pretty these days.

203
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,300
Who hasn't met

204
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,780
any scumbags?

205
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,460
It's lucky

206
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,980
to find it out

207
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
as early as possible.

208
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,660
Wei.

209
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,900
So you are the girl named Wei.

210
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,410
Do you think people with a wealthy background like Cheng Yao

211
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,410
will marry someone unknown like you?

212
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,230
I can tell that

213
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,350
you like him very much.

214
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,980
It must be difficult

215
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,580
to win the heart of an affectionate man

216
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,460
like Cheng Yao, right?

217
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,180
Wish you happy.

218
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,620
Are you leaving like this?

219
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,380
What are you doing?

220
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,330
Let me go.

221
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,940
Cheng Yao,

222
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,690
no matter when you began to be with her,

223
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,170
it is not important anymore.

224
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,850
I'm just glad that

225
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,140
I found it out

226
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,500
so early.

227
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,140
Wei. Let me explain.

228
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,850
From now on,

229
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,930
we go our separate ways.

230
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,620
And we should never meet again.

231
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,620
Wei.

232
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,740
This girl is interesting.

233
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,660
Wait for me here.

234
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,540
I will get the car.

235
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,230
Tingzhou,

236
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,820
you have to deal with this.

237
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,380
You chose the hotel for the meeting.

238
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,260
And it has become a place of sadness for Miss Ming.

239
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,980
Shouldn't you be responsible for it?

240
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,260
She should thank me

241
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,100
for helping her identify that scumbag early.

242
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,860
OK.

243
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,300
As a gentle man,

244
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,340
it is a basic principle for me not to

245
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,540
let girls cry in front of me.

246
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,210
Mr. Mu.

247
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,940
Thank you.

248
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,380
Would you like to take a photo with me?

249
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,010
This is the first time for Mr. Mu

250
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,260
to offer to take a photo with others.

251
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,300
Hurry up.

252
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,590
Thank you.

253
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,340
Here. Smile, you two.

254
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,810
Closer.

255
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,050
Smile.

256
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,780
Three, two, one.

257
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,530
OK.

258
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,900
Have a look.

259
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,500
Thank you.

260
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,340
It's so ugly.

261
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,620
Can we take one more?

262
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,620
It's good.

263
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,940
You can photoshop it later.

264
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,820
Remember. Don't upload it to any social platforms.

265
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,740
Why did this happen?

266
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,060
It's so shameful.

267
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,260
Wei.

268
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,700
I think I have made it quite clear.

269
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,780
Wei,

270
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,540
I have no relationship with her anymore.

271
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I wanted to break up with her

272
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,700
when I first met you.

273
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,140
But she was working all the time,

274
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,100
so I didn't have the chance.

275
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,700
I planned to have the last meal with her today.

276
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,340
I know I was wrong.

277
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,180
I didn't tell you in advance.

278
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,020
I will behave better in the future, okay?

279
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,620
You were arm in arm so intimately.

280
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,620
I don't think you were having the last meal.

281
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,290
It is a fact that you have cheated on me.

282
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,860
You can make your promise,

283
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,020
but I can never believe you.

284
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,110
Let's break up

285
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,620
and make the ending decent.

286
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,140
Wei.

287
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,020
I know I hurt you.

288
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,540
I hope you can give some time

289
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,490
to our relationship and let yourself calm down.

290
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,260
Don't give up easily, okay?

291
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm not suitable to

292
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,380
a man who is affectionate like you.

293
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,100
Let me go.

294
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,850
Wei. Listen to me. Wei.

295
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,420
Qiao.

296
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,380
Why did you beat me?

297
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,220
I'm hitting a cheating scumbag like you.

298
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,220
What's wrong?

299
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,250
Stay away from my sister.

300
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,820
I cannot make sure where I will kick you next time.

301
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,100
Get lost.

302
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,900
Sister, let me tell you.

303
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,180
We are from a martial arts family.

304
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,140
You should beat scumbags like Cheng Yao

305
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,820
every time you meet one.

306
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,020
There is no need to be kind.

307
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,820
What if he is hurt?

308
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,140
I know how much strength I use, ok?

309
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,860
Sister,

310
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,290
when will you take photos wearing the Han costume next time?

311
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,260
Can I go with you?

312
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,690
I just worry that Cheng Yao

313
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,620
comes to plague you again.

314
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,860
I'm not going for fun for sure.

315
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
The model company didn't

316
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,100
assign me for any new work recently.

317
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,820
The interpretation jobs these days

318
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,580
went quite smooth.

319
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,860
This is the pay of three days.

320
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,340
Guess who I met today.

321
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,090
Who?

322
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,810
Mu Tingzhou.

323
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,220
The Best Actor.

324
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,210
Come in.

325
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,900
I have found it.

326
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
I almost promised to be the son-in-law of the director.

327
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,740
Can't he even promise to lend me some books?

328
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,820
What documents can't be found

329
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,020
on the Internet?

330
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,990
And you insist in checking the ancient books.

331
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,420
How can it be the same to read on a computer!

332
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,380
For example, the font

333
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,340
is not time honored.

334
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,170
Look.

335
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,220
The yellowing paper

336
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,370
shows the warmth of the age.

337
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,820
I can only get the rotten smell.

338
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,780
What's more,

339
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,420
Mu Yun was a highly ranked official at that time.

340
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,900
As long as you understand

341
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,860
what big figures did at that time, you should be good.

342
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,100
Why do you check

343
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,780
the small things of folks.

344
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,860
The official history

345
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,540
is only the basic knowledge.

346
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,700
It can only help with framing a person.

347
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,780
Only when you understand

348
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,820
the daily customs of folks deeply,

349
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,340
can you create a lively figure.

350
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,980
How do you think? Is he handsome?

351
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,050
Is he as tall as it is shown on TV?

352
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,060
It's alright.

353
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,820
I don't think he is easygoing.

354
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,920
I intended to ask for an autograph for you.

355
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,990
But he told me that

356
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,180
I was the fourth.

357
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,330
Do you know why?

358
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,700
I read from the tabloid that

359
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,740
he only signs for

360
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,900
three people every day.

361
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,700
It's such a pity that you didn't get it, sis.

362
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,420
It's worth lots of money.

363
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,540
So great.

364
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,140

Hello, Miss Ming Wei.

368

I'm Shen Su from Dongying Group.

369
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,370
We are planning to do a costume drama.

371
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,740
I have seen the photos of you wearing the Han costume on Weibo

372
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,060
and think your image

373
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,450
is similar to the role in our drama.

this is

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
Why this scene again?

570
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,740
He'll find out, awkwardly,

571
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,900
that all the propositions of Zhang Juzheng

572
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,300
were all proposed and done before

573
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,940
by his predecessors.

574
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,780
The only thing he's done better than them is...

575
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,780
So handsome!

576
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Go on.

577
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,180
You go.

578
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,970
Milk tea for you.

579
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,210
And my WeChat.

580
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,890
Thank you.

581
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,740
Can't you keep it more low-key?

582
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,500
I didn't do anything.

583
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,020
I'm just so charming.

584
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,100
What can I do?

585
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,740
Let's go.

586
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,250
[Shenghe Central Library]

587
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,340
Ming Wei.

588
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,370
Mr. Mu. Mr. Xiao.

589
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,940
Call me Xiao Zhao.

590
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,980
Why are you here?

591
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:27,860
I heard that

592
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,740
there's a lecture on the chief cabinet ministers of the Ming Dynasty.

593
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,500
I thought it would help me to understand the script.

594
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,540
That's why I'm here.

595
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,070
Are you here for that, too?

596
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,900
Not us, just him.

597
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,900
I didn't see Mr. Mu just now.

598
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,660
Good for you, Ming Wei.

599
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,500
You are quite hardworking.

600
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm betting on you.

601
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,980
This is my first time acting,

602
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
and I'll be working with Mr. Mu.

603
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,530
Of course I have to work very hard.

604
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,100
All the best.

605
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,970
If you have any questions, just ask him.

606
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,920
Don't stand on ceremony.

607
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,780
How do you feel

608
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,860
about this one month of training?

609
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,500
I've learned a lot.

610
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,900
For me,

611
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,090
it's like opening a door to a brand new world.

612
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,340
I want to learn more.

613
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,340
It's a pity that there's no time left.

614
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,700
In the acting industry,

615
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,300
it's very important to keep on learning.

616
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,580
But innate talent is also very important.

617
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,380
After all,

618
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,500
no matter how many books you read and how comprehensive the notes you take,

619
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,420
if you are not a natural,

620
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,910
it won't make any difference.

621
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,420
I'm not sure if I'm gifted or not,

622
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,660
but I believe that

623
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
diligence can make up for a lot.

624
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,500
Since the crew has chosen me,

625
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,850
I'll do my best.

626
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,140
I have a bottom line

627
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,340
that is

628
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,660
we can't delay our shooting schedule

629
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,500
for any actor's incapabilities.

630
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,780
I hope that

631
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,100
you won't let the whole crew down.

632
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,100
Rest assured.

633
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,300
If I let you down,

634
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,980
I'll leave on my own.

635
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,980
I won't delay the schedule.

636
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,630
See you tomorrow.

637
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,820
Mr. Chen.

[Grand Chief Cabinet Minister]

639
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,500
Miss Ming.

640
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,860
Hello.

641
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,940
Mr. Chen.

642
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,220
Hello.

643
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,780
I missed you at the booting ceremony.

644
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,000
I never thought I'd meet you here.

645
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,470
What a coincidence.

646
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,580
Let me introduce myself formally.

647
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,550
Princess, I'm your consort, Chen Zhang.

648
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,930
Mr. Chen,

649
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,660
this is my first time shooting a show.

650
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,340
Sorry if I have to bother you in the future.

651
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,700
It's my honor

652
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,020
to share the princess's cares and burdens.

653
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,340
You've already started flirting.

654
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,340
Director.

655
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,140
Hello, director.

656
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,660
Hello.

657
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:55,670
Mr. Mu.

658
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:57,980
Director.

659
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:58,980
Since I'm about to marry Ming Wei

660
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,580
very soon,

661
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,500
it doesn't count.

662
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,780
It was an expression of sincerity

663
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,180
and loyalty to her.

664
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,420
Alright.

665
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,460
Ming Wei.

666
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,260
You will be shooting your first scene tomorrow.

667
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,500
When you're home,

668
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,900
study the script carefully.

669
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,260
You are the only rookie in our crew.

670
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,260
Remember to learn from Mr. Mu and Mr. Chen.

671
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,900
Don't fall behind,

672
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,060
OK?

673
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,020
No problem, director.

674
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,340
I'll try my best.

675
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,580
Alright, go back and have a good rest.

676
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,410
You will all be shooting lots of scenes soon.

677
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,980
Director,

678
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,180
I have something

679
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,180
I want to talk to you about.

680
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,220
OK.

681
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,700
-See you, director. -See you.

682
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,860
See you, then.

683
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,900
OK.

684
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,780
He's gone, right?

685
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,780
I'll take the elevator after he's gone.

686
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,170
Don't you want to come in?

687
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,490
Oh my God, he's not gone.

688
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,660
Mr. Mu.

689
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,620
Mr. Mu.

690
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,740
What's up?

691
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,540
I'm a rookie.

692
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,730
I hope I can learn from you

693
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,860
in the future.

694
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,740
I can consider teaching you in my free time,

695
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,980
but first,

696
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,980
you have to show me your sincerity.

697
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,370
What are you referring to?

698
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,580
Why...why is he coming so close?

699
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,900
It can't be what I'm thinking, right?

700
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,900
The unspoken rules.
