00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,420
Consort, congratulations

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,500
on having a good match.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,900
Please.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,500
Thank you, Consort.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,890
Everyone, thank you for coming to the ceremony.

Congratulations, Consort.

Grand Tutor,

10
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I know that

11
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,730
there is a place for me in your heart.

12
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,100
Is this a dream

13
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,300
or reality?

14
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,300
If it's a dream,

15
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,180
I hope

16
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,820
I will never wake up.

[Episode 4]

19
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,300
No.

20
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,700
I shouldn't be this shy.

21
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,130
Am I being too ugly?

22
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,940
I should be more initiative

23
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,060
and aggressive.

24
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,180
This should be good enough.

25
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,659
I will need to

26
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,340
have a professional kiss tomorrow.

27
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,300
I will let the scene pass without second shooting.

28
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,180
The Ministry of Revenue has drafted the Land Measuring Regulations.

29
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,020
Local governments have to measure the land

30
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,180
and redraw the map according to it.

31
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,820
You are not young, Lord Mu.

32
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,500
Have you thought of when to get married?

33
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,690
I haven't had the thought yet.

34
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,700
Do you have anyone in mind?

35
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,940
If there is someone,

36
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,540
I can grant marriage for you.

37
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,340
However, as you are in

38
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,020
a really important position,

39
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,340
you should be more careful in choosing a wife.

40
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,980
Not everyone can be your wife,

41
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,010
Lord Mu.

42
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,170
If she has any disrespectful thoughts and defies her superiors,

43
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,300
it could hurt our relationship.

44
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,100
Don't you think so?

Don't follow me anymore.

Your Highness, Your Highness.

49
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,020
According to the Emperor's edict,

50
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,900
Grand Chief Cabinet Minister, Mu Yun is at the age of marriage.

51
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,300
A virtuous lady should be chosen to match him.

52
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,010
The daughter of Guo Family is not betrothed yet.

53
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,260
She is respectful, prudent, elegant, smart, gentle and kind.

54
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,090
Therefore, she is granted to Mu Yun as his wife.

55
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,820

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,200
Why?

58
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,820
You had promised me.

59
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,220
Why are you marrying others?

60
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,450
I was assigned to be your tutor according to the edict of the late emperor,

61
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,170
and I have never thought of other things.

62
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,500
I don't believe it.

63
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,260
If you don't have me in your heart,

64
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,180
why do you come to the date of Double Seventh Festival?

65
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,820
I have never had other thoughts on you, Your Highness.

66
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,140
It is my fault

67
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,650
to let you misunderstand it.

68
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,020
Misunderstanding?

69
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,020
You can tell me

70
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,380
if you have ineffable difficulties.

71
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,420
You can tell me that you are forced to marry someone else.

72
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,500
As long as you tell me in person

73
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,940
that I did have a place in your heart.

How could you say this?

80
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,870
Fine.

81
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,000
Since I took this to the wrong way,

82
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,460
this is not your fault.

83
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,490
Look at me.

forget me.

87
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,330

88

and convey my willingness to marry him.

97

As for the date of wedding,

98
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,130
it can be the same day

99
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,860
as your wedding.

100
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,420

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,130
you are my favorite,

102

103

Since you have belonged to someone,

104

as a rookie,

119
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,940
you are worthy of praise for your

120

demonstration of this role.

121
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,980
Tingzhou,

122
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,140
you don't do kissing scenes.

123
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,220
I thought about how could I

124
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,700
persuade you.

125
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,020
It seems like two of you are

126
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,130

127
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,100
Two of you,

128

please keep up the good work,

129
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,580
OK?

130
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,650
Director, I will try to do better.

131
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,600
Good.

132
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,060
What is it?

133
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,020
Not sure.

134
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,340
Never thought it would be like this.

135
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,020
Director, I am flattered.

136
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,980
Since I have accepted this acting job,

137
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,860
I should have followed the requirements of the script

138
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,900
to do what I should do.

139
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,130
Yes, correct.

140

It works this way?

143
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,860
What is the deal?

144
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,100

146
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,060
you did a great job!

147
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,420
It would be our part in the next scene.

148
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Shall we rehearse the lines?

149
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,210
Alright,

150
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,180

Ms. Shen.

153
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,420
How's it going? Aren't you tired?

154
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,140
I am alright. I am alright.

155
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,050
What brings you here?

156
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,060
I am here to

157
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,170
talk to you

158
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,660
about signing the contract with Dongying Group.

159
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,530
I...

160
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,300
Do you think I am qualified?

161
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,540
I am still a rookie,

162
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,660
and I am just working on my first show.

163
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,020
Just because your are a rookie,

164
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
it is easy for me to train you.

165
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,780
It seems like you do not fully understand

166
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,580
our circle.

167
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,940
But it does not matter.

168
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,930
I already noticed you

169
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,500
during the trials.

170
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,740
You are good-looking

171
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,330
and I have watched all the shows you are in recently.

172
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,620
You are good at acting.

173
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,700
Such a young successor.

174
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,210
Thank you.

175
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,410
But this happens too fast.

176
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,020
Could you give me some time and

177
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,100
let me think it through?

178
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,180
Of course.

179
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,570
I have brought a brokerage contract

180
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,140
of Dongying Group and

181
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,820
a future plan of yours.

182
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,300
Please take a look when you have time.

183
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,700
Alright, Ms. Shen.

184
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,340
Work hard,

185
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,820
but you should settle your contract as early as possible.

186
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,550
It could provide you a big help

187
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,020
in this industry.

188
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:07,900
Alright.

189
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,580
I will get back to you as soon as I am done with thinking.

190
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,700
You should be exhausted after one day of shooting.

191
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,860
Have an early rest.

192
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:13,820
Alright.

193
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,500
Good Night.

194
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,100
Good Night.

195
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,500
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

196
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:30,620
Thank you!

197
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,420
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

198
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,180
Thank all of you!

199
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

200
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,460
Thank you!

201
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,620
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

202
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,170
Thanks.

203
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,290
It's Mr. Mu's birthday today?

204
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,500
His fans are pulling a banner outside.

205
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,690
You don't see it?

206
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,220
I did not notice it.

207
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,060
There is a birthday event after shooting tonight.

208
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,180
Do you want to join?

209
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,620
I did not prepare any birthday present for him.

210
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,940
How can I go?

211
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,020
It is not late to prepare now.

212
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,580
Mr. Mu,

213
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,900
Happy Birthday!

214
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,580
Mr. Mu, please change the clothes first.

215
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,260
Get ready.

216
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,340
Can you give me a direction?

217
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,740
It is a closed-book exam, don't ask me.

218
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,530
I will be waiting for your surprises.

219
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,780
Surprise!

220
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,620
Surprise!

221
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,740
Mr. Mu.

222
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,180
I... I just want to make a good meal

223
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,500
to thank you for taking care of me.

224
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,420
I didn't expect I would mess it up.

225
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,460
So I felt ashamed and

226
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,020
hid there.

227
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,500
Mr. Mu, I didn't mean that to happen.

228
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:15,980
Mr. Mu,

229
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,980
I have cleaned it up for you.

230
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,380
I am going to leave first.

231
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,660
Wait!

232
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,460
You have messed the dinner up.

233
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,820
What would you give him for present?

234
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,820
Mr. Mu,

235
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,500
what do you want for present?

236
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,020
Cut, cut, cut.

237
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,340
Ming Wei, what are you giggling about?

238
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,460
Princess Ming Hua and the Grand Tutor

239
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,740
are in separation between life and death.

240
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,820
Where is your sadness?

241
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,380
Director, sorry.

242
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,220
Let me work on my emotions.

243
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,340
Damn, I had too much fun yesterday.

244
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,980
I cannot concentrate now.

245
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,980
Ming Wei,

246
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,820
after shooting these scenes,

247
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,780
the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister is scheduled to wrap.

248
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,450
Do you know what this means?

249
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,180
Some actors would only work together

250
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,140
for once in their lives.

251
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,140
In other words,

252
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,100
after the wrap,

253
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,210
we might not see each other again.

254
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,540
Director,

255
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,660
can we shoot one more time?

256
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,620
OK.

257
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,300
I didn't know you were here, Your Highness.

258
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,660
Forgive me.

259
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,900
Your Highness.

260
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,610
I can't afford this.

261
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,780
Your Highness, please get up.

262
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,540
The consort was accused of conspiracy.

263
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,300
I am not asking for forgiveness.

264
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
But please save my two children.

265
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,900
They are innocent.

266
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,580
Now His Majesty only listens to you.

267
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,260
I have already decided to see His Majesty before going to court tomorrow,

268
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,860
and ask for forgiveness for two lords.

269
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Your Highness, don't worry.

270
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,500
Even if I have to die,

271
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,100
I will protect them.

272
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,980
All that I pursue in life

273
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,020
is to make sure Your Highness

274
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,570
can always be superior,

275
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,260
and never have to bow down to others.

276
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,020
Your Highness, when you knelt down,

277
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,180
you also denied my life-long pursuit.

278
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,500
I failed the late Emperor's trust.

279
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,420
I...

280
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,020
Even death cannot atone for my offense.

281
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,260
Your Highness, please get up.

282
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,610
I will.

283
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,100
Get up too, Grand Tutor.

284
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,980
Thank you, Your Highness.

285
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,660
You have done nothing wrong.

286
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,500
In this world,

287
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,700
no one else can be like you.

288
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,540
You have considered everything for me.

289
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,250
But I

290
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,380
haven't done anything for you,

291
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,780
and even put you in such a situation.

292
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,300
I have no regret

293
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,020
in my life

294
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,140
since I have met you.

295
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,580
If there's an afterlife,

296
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,260
I wish we won't do each other wrong again,

297
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,210
and stay together.

298
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,620
If there's an afterlife,

299
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,140
I, Mu Yun, will definitely put everything behind,

300
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,660
only to stay with you

301
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,580
for a lifetime.

302
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,460
Your Highness.

303
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,460
Your Highness, big trouble.

304
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,340
Your Highness, big trouble.

305
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,660
What happened?

306
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,140
News just came from the Imperial Palace.

307
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,340
His Majesty wouldn't withdraw the edict.

308
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,820
Two lords were already sent to the dead cell.

309
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,810
Tomorrow, between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., they will be...

310
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,260
They will be...

311
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,940
If he can't persuade His Majesty...

312
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,700
Prepare zheng

313
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,540
and wine for me.

314
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,620
Your Highness.

315
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,420
Grand Tutor.

316
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,820
Grand Tutor, without His Majesty's order,

317
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,130
you can't break into the palace.

318
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,570
I have to see His Majesty today.

319
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,340
If I let you in, I will die.

320
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,060
Move.

321
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,900
Grand Tutor,

322
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:03,790
[Hanyuan Palace]

323
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,620
Grand Tutor,

324
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:51,050
[Virtue can give off real fragrance.]

325
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,340
[Virtue can give off real fragrance.]

326
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,940
Cut.

327
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,420
Wrap.

328
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,370
-Great! -It's wrapped! It's wrapped!

329
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,380
Let's take some rest.

330
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,170
Goodbye, Your Highness.
