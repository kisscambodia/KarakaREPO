these years?

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,140
I adopted a child,

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,070
and named him Mu Ze.

8
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,970
He is all grown up now.

00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,769
Does Mu Ze treat you well?

10
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,280
He treats me like his own father.

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,380
If we started over,

12
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,930
would you lie to me again?

13

14

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,909
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

82
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,260
Thank you for being so tolerant of me during filming.

83
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,450
You've taught me a lot.

84
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm so fortunate

85
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,190
to have worked with you on my first ever show.

86
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,050
You don't need to thank me.

87
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,860
The one you should thank

88
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,080
is Tingzhou.

89
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,400
To be honest,

90
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,660
you were not my choice

91
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,090
in the beginning.

92
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,730
But Tingzhou saw

93
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,280
your glistening potential,

94
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,920
and insisted on you being the leading lady

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
of this show.

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,110

he was right about this.

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,170
If it were not for him,

99
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,740
I would have missed out on a great new actress.

104

Don't say that.

105

As long as you remember that,

106
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,350
to continue being an actress,

107
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,990
you need to be worthy of this job

108
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,670
and true to your heart.

109
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,460

Ming Wei.

175
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,990
You've been through a lot these days,

176
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,470
and gained some experience.

177
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,560
Don't mind me.

178
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,580
I have to remind you again,

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,880
you've started high.

180
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,810
So for the next show,

181
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,630
if you can be the leading lady, don't take a supporting role.

182
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,860
OK, got it.

183
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,590
Mr. Mu,

184
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,200
in fact,

185
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,270
I had a lot of misunderstandings about you in the beginning.

186
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,990
I felt that

187
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,600
you were proud and indifferent,

188
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,610
hard to get along with.

189
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,730
But now I know that

190
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,250
you are warm inside although you appear cold.

191
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,430
You are gentle and kind.

192
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,250
You are both my

193
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,400
acting and moral role model.

194
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,180
I hope I get the chance to continue learning from you in the future.

195
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,660
Ming Wei!

196
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,630
I finally caught you.

197
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,060
-Chen Zhang. -I was afraid I wouldn't be able to send you off.

198
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,780
Don't stand on ceremony.

199
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,340
Have you packed everything?

200
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,350
It's alright, my flight is in the afternoon.

201
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,410
What's your plan after this?

202
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,600
I want to rest for a few days.

203
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,530
I've signed a contract with Dongying,

204
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,190
and may start choosing a new script in a few days.

205
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,020
What about you?

206
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,290
I got an offer for a big production,

207
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,930
with a great director and scriptwriter.

208
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,730
The creator team is great too.

209
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,840
That's amazing! I'm happy for you.

210
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,390
Ming Wei,

211
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,670
if we collaborate again,

212
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,910
I don't want to be your consort only in name.

213
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,490
I want it to be true.

214
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,530
My car is here.

215
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,760
We'd see each other again.

Welcome home, star of tomorrow, Miss Ming Wei!

224

Wei, I missed you so much!

226

Look,

227
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,020
I made a huge spread.

228
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,490
You cooked all of this?

229
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,590
Of course.

230
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,430
You're back, I have to show off my skills.

231
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,780
Quick, go wash your hands and come eat.

232
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,580
OK.

233
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,400
Let me see if your cooking

234
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,360
has improved.

235
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,620
Of course it has.

236
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,460
When you were not around,

237
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,890
I had to feed myself.

238
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,030
Are you serious?

239
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,590
It's terrible!

240
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,060
How did you live?

241
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,160
I'd poke this

242
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,630
into your eyes any time.

243
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,680
I was joking.

244
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,110
It's pretty good, you've improved.

245
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:41,780
Wei.

246
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,460
Yes.

247
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,300
How was filming?

248
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,350
Was it fun,

249
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,090
filming this... with the aloof Best Actor？

250
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,950
I...

251
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,580
Wait, don't be rash.

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,200
What did it feel like filming the kissing scenes?

253
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,040
Stop.

254
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,810
I was the only rookie on set,

255
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,950
you don't know how many mistakes I made.

256
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,800
I can't bear to look back on them.

257
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,390
Thank goodness you didn't see me acting

258
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,700
the last time you came to visit.

259
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,520
The last time I came to visit,

260
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,400
it was pretty good.

261

That Xiao Zhao,

262
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,300
is truly a top-notch entertainment agent.

263
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,600
No wonder so many girls love him.

264
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,380
Stay away from him.

265
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,240
He's a nice person,

"Cherish your life and stay away from Xiao Zhao."

269
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,600
I know this principle,

270
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,700
and I have high standards.

271
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,880
I won't fall for this, alright?

272
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,350

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,360
looking at materials from Grand Chief Cabinet Minister.

282
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,710
The show is over, Tingzhou.

283
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,060
You need to pick yourself up.

284
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,370
We should return to real life,

285
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,170
and prepare for the next show.

286

[Mu Tingzhou]

288
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,010
The Best Actor's autograph.

289
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,120
Wei, this is super valuable!

290
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,010
I love you, Wei!

291
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,320
Kid, why are you always only thinking about money?

292
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,740
Didn't you say you wanted that?

293
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,580
Of course I want it.

294
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,820
Wei, so...

295
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,630
is it easy to make friends with the aloof Best Actor?

296
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,970
He does like to put on a straight face,

297
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,790
and he's indifferent to everything,

298
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,760
except for acting.

299
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,370
Only then would he dedicate himself unreservedly.

300
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,980
Although he usually looks very aloof,

301
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,950
he's actually

302
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,510
very thoughtful.

303
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,360
From my perspective,

304
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,000
the real respect for women

305
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,220
is to not deceive them emotionally,

306
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,160
or disturb their lives.

307
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,680
Kiss me.

308
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,830
You're not in love with him, are you?

What are you talking about?

310
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,810
He's so high up there,

311
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,220
the famous Best Actor.

312
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,780
I'm just a small actor,

313
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,750
the gap is too wide.

314
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,270
He is just an idol

315
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,830
and role model for my work.

316
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,470
I just respect him.

317
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,020
Then what were your eyes doing just now?

318
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,660
There were sparks flying.

319
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,480
You're mistaken.

320
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,670
Wei,

321
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,600
have you heard that

322
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,830
a man will idolize

323
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,350
a woman due to love,

324
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,080
while a woman would love a man

325
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,130
because she idolizes him?

326
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,910
You thought of this yourself, didn't you?

327
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,720
I've never heard of it.

328
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,040
What's the point of saying this?

329
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,230
We won't cross paths anymore.

330
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
Be honest with me,

331
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,880
are you like that because you can't get out of the character,

332
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,310
or are you not able to let go of Ming Wei?

333
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,160
If it's the former,

334
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,880
I'd get a therapist

335
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,630
to help you.

336
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
I'll go on trips with you to relax.

337
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,460
I'll accompany you to shop and vent.

338
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,140
But if you're hung up on Ming Wei,

339
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,820
you should go and chase after her!

340

What are you doing at home all day?

341
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,200
A man should take real action.

besides the dubbing and press conference,

347
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,030
it'll be difficult for you to see Ming Wei again.

348
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,520

I've looked through all the recent projects.

369

I think these two

370

suit you the best.

371
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,310
This Nanxian Zhuan

372
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,820
is a costume drama adapted from a novel.

373
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,340
The male and female leads are both A-list stars.

374
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,770
It is a big and well-funded production.

375
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,280
Even as a second female lead,

376
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,750

You can choose to be the female lead for this one.

381
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,040
So, choose one from the two.

382
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,020
[The South City]

383
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,640
you've started high.

384
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,900
So for the next show,

385
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,630
if you can be the leading lady, don't take a supporting role.

386
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,610
I choose The South City.

387
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,760
Although Nanxian Zhuan is well-funded, with a strong cast,

388
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,950
there's a saying,

389
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,850
"it's better to be a chicken's head than a phoenix's tail."

390
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm not sure if I'm right about this.

391
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,090
What do you think?

392
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,080
I think so, too.

393
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,230
It's decided then.

394
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,950
I'll go have your pay settled.

395
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,250
Take a good look at the script when you're back,

396
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,890
and start pre-filming training as soon as possible.

397
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,820
OK.

398
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,830
[The South City]

399
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,830
Hi everyone,

400
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,510
during this period,

401
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,730
I'll be your teacher.

402
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,600
Everyone here is an actor for The South City.

403
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,620
[The South City]

404
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,200
I believe that after this training,

405
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,340
you'd have a better understanding of

406
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,690
the historical background of the show.

407
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,160
I hope we have a pleasant time.

408
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,050
Thank you.

409
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,150
Sorry, teacher,

410
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,990
I'm late.

411
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,530
It's alright.

412
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,330
Take a seat.

413
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,500
Everyone, please look at

414
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,420
your materials.

415
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,930
We'd start the class now.

416
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,910
Let me take a look.

417
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,090
You didn't think you'd bump into me here, did you?

418
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,580
The circle is pretty small,

419
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,770
it's to be expected that we would meet again.

420
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,320
I just don't know

421
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,340
what role you are playing this time.

422
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,820
Happy working with you.

423
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm not as lucky as you,

424
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,410
having someone to back you up,

425
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,800
getting to be the female lead once you debut.

426
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,290
But this time, we have many scenes together.

427
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,150
I'm the second female lead,

428
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,510
that is, your stepmother.

429
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,900
In the script, the stepmother isn't very old,

430
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,750
so this is quite suitable for you.

431
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,350
You don't need to be so arrogant.

432
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,200
What comes around, goes around.

433
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,100
Maybe one day, I'd get lucky.

434
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,370
I'm an actress.

435
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,970
Even if I can only be a supporting actress today,

436
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,520
I will try my best.

437
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,880
I will never look down upon any chances.

438
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,980
I believe you.

439
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,920
Although I don't like you very much,

440
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,070
it doesn't mean you are not a good actress.

441
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,070
Moreover, I would like to tell you.

442
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,920
I don't have any wealthy supporters.

443
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,430
I have never relied on anyone

444
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,240
after entering this field.

445
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,880
I hope I will never

446
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,690
hear such rumors from you again.

447
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,370
Or

448
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,970
I will sue you for defamation.

449
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,450
[You are my princess]

450
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,380
Grand Tutor.

451
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,440
Hello.

452
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,870
Tingzhou.

453
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,720
Why do you change the dubbing time so casually

454
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,020
and didn't tell me in advance?

455
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,030
The schedule arranged for you later has all been messed up.

456
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,040
Ming Wei?

457
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,400
I remember she wasn't scheduled to

458
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,620
dub on the same day with you.

459
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,090
Great.

460
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,440
You are a grown man now.

461
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,790
I will send you up later,

462
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,880
and then I will leave.

463
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,950
You need to make your own efforts afterwards.

464
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,610
Great!

465
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,080
I am the third.

466
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,710
Congratulations.

467
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,630
I like you so much.

468
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,220
Next time. Next time.

469
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,610
There are still chances next time.

470
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,930
Grand Tutor.

471
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,600
Mr. Mu.

472
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,620
Long time no see.

473
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,490
Long time no see.

474
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,720
I didn't expect to come across you here.

475
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,820
I thought

476
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,260
I was the only one of dubbing today.

477
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,100
Yes.

478
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,740
I don't know why.

479
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,040
They informed me temporarily

480
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,140
to dub together with you.

481
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,860
What a coincidence!

482
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,650
Mr. Mu,

483
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,250
let's go inside.

484
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,620
Let's go.

485
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,880
Stop.

486
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,900
Sorry.

487
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,580
Please don't have body touch with each other.

488
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,140
There will be sound of friction.

489
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,480
Thank you.

490
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,210
Sorry, director.

491
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,540
Sorry, director.

492
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,400
OK. Let's start again.

493
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,679
Once again.

494
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,190
OK. Great. Start.

495
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,250
Are you well

496
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,820
these years?

497
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,790
Jin'er died three months

498
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,969
after the marriage.

499
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,620
And I adopted a son afterwards,

500
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,639
named Mu Ze.

501
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,510
He has grown up now.

502
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,720
Does Mu Ze treat you well?

503
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,290
He treats me as if I'm his real father.

504
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,820
Sorry, director.

505
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,800
I think my condition and emotion

506
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,040
are very different from the time

507
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,600
when we were shooting this scene.

508
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,110
Should we hug

509
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,630
each other?

510
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,770
This won't work.

511
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,080
It will influence the sound.

512
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,010
Let's try to

513
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,900
put our emotions into words,

514
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,610
okay?

515
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,530
OK.

516
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,210
OK, director.

517
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Alright. Thank you.

518
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,680
After this sentence,

519
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
I will say bye to the Best Actor for sure.

520
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,100
And perhaps

521
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,210
we will never meet again.

522
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,210
Does Mu Ze

523
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,120
treat you well?

524
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:07,920
I'm sorry, director.

525
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,270
I think our feelings

526
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,230
are not connected to the former ones.

527
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,490
Can we try it again?

528
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,140
OK.

529
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,900
OK. Let's try again.

530
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,470
Are you well

531
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,040
these years?

532
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm sorry, director.

533
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,740
My voice is husky.

534
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,500
I need to have some water.

535
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:51,890
OK. Once more.

536
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,540
Does Mu Ze treat you well?

537
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,400
I need to use the restroom.

538
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,340
Director, I didn't make two words right just now.

539
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,570
I'm sorry, director.

540
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,410
Can you remind me of my next sentence?

541
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,670
Named Mu Ze. Thank you.

542
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,180
He treats me as if I'm his real father.

543
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,700
My emotion is not adequate, director.

544
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,900
Director, I'm too involved.

545
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,030
Can I wipe my nose?

546
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,350
He's a real Best Actor.

547
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,530
He really cares about every detail.

548
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,380
OK. Let's start again.

549
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,220
OK.

550
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,500
Mu Tingzhou.

551
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,460
Don't hesitate.

552
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,180
Grab the chance.

553
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,530
Don't make yourself regret.

554
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,070
Ming Wei.

555
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,450
Mr. Mu.

556
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:58,920
Are you going home?

557
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,270
Let me give you a ride.

558
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,290
Thank you,

559
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,680
but I'm not going home.

560
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,830
My friend asked me to

561
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,510
talk about being her bridesmaid.

562
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,240
I might not share the same route with you.

563
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,960
Please go back straight.

564
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,300
The rain is too heavy.

565
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,150
It can be hard to get a taxi now.

566
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,450
I'd better give you a ride.

567
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,400
[Two more minutes estimated to be needed.]

568
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,550
The taxi is here.

569
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:27,990
Right.

570
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,010
Didn't expect it to come so quickly.

571
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,110
I waited for an hour

572
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,330
last time when there was only small rain.

573
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,620
Mr. Mu.

574
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,550
Please go back straight.

575
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,110
Safe driving.

576
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,790
No hurry.

577
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,150
I can be your company for a while.

578
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,630
-Well. -Well.

579
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,310
You say it.

580
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,510
What's your plan for work afterwards?

581
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,320
Have you got a great play?

582
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,940
Some are being discussed.

583
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,490
I haven't decided yet.

584
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,340
I don't think it is proper.

585
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,650
Why?

586
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,410
Is it because of the character?

587
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,880
No.

588
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,310
I don't like the kissing scene in it.

589
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,820
So, I'd rather give up.

590
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,600
You can have the lip mask.

591
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,030
I'm not willing to do it

592
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
even with the mask.

593
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,860
It seems that you do hate kissing scenes.

594
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,170
I

595
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,940
was lucky last time.

596
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,310
Actually, Ming Wei, I...

597
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,630
Mr. Mu. My taxi is here.

598
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,810
I'm leaving.

599
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,950
Bye.

600
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,340
Thank you.

601
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,140
Drive slowly, sir.

602
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,090
Actually, I didn't mean that.

603
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,150
[The Theme Song of Grand Chief Cabinet Minister]

604
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,680
If there's an afterlife,

605
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,460
I hope we can be together

606
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,180
and stay together.

607
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,500
If there's an afterlife,

608
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,230
I will give up everything

609
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,670
just to stay with you

610
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,530
be with you.
