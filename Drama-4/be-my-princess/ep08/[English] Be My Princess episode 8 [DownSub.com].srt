Is Her Highness's wedding

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,540
more glorious than this?

Now there is no one above the Chief Cabinet Minister except His Majesty.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,180
For an important thing such as getting married,

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,660
he may not be less glorious than the royal family.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,700

Chief Cabinet Minister, have you thought this through?

25
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,060
If you insist on going inside,

26
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,980
you are violating the edict.

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
You are no difference to those treacherous ministers and traitors.

Bye.

84
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,280
Everyone.

85
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,420
thank all of you

86
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,010
for coming to my wedding today.

87
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,300
I am afraid

88
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,770
that you might persuade me to drink wine.

89
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,340
But I have an

90
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,490
important mission today

91
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,180
that I have to do first.

92
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,540
Ming Wei,

93
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,460
would you please come to the stage first?

94
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,900
Why?

95
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,100
Come on, quickly.

96
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,860
Come on, up here.

97
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,220
What is she going to do?

98
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,220
Why?

99
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,060
Wei is my best roommate

100
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,740
and my best friend in college.

101
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,620
See.

102
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,340
Wei is so beautiful

103
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,380
and with good conditions.

104
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,180
But do you believe

105
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,420
a beautiful girl like her

106
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,580
is still single?

107
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,380
No.

108
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,980
Xiaoya, what are you doing?

109
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,380
You have told me before

110
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,660
you have met someone unreliable, right?

111
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,300
But feel assured, Wei.

112
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,900
I will find you someone reliable now.

113
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,460
I will do what I have promised.

114
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,900
Don't do this.

115
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,260
Everyone here today has a benefit.

116
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,540
Whoever wants to chase Wei,

117
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,490
raise your hands.

118
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,820
Wei, take a look. I have told you

119
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,860
you should be confident.

120
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,580
Here.

121
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,490
Do you want to promote yourself to us

122
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,900
and fight for your happiness?

123
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,500
Say something!

124
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,980
I am not in a hurry to find a boyfriend.

125
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,940
I understand.

126
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,220
You are once bitten twice shy.

127
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,860
You don't trust your judgement, right?

128
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,220
Don't worry. I will help you.

129
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,540
Enough.

130
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,770
Everyone.

131
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,500
Ming Wei has strict requests

132
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,060
for her boyfriend.

133
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,420
It must be someone who will treat her sincerely

134
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,540
and never regret.

135
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,140
So,

136
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,900
anyone who thinks he can do it,

137
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,590
be sure to seize the opportunity.

138
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,140
Ask the waiters around you for

139
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,340
love stickers.

140
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,700
And stick them on Ming Wei.

141
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,500
Han Xiaoya.

142
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,820
This is too much!

143
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,540
Wei, how can you say this?

144
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,620
I did this for you.

145
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,860
Gentlemen, the more you stick,

146
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,380
the more connection you have with Ming Wei.

147
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,580
Fighting!

148
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,530
Come here.

149
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,780
Go up, up.

150
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,500
What are you doing? Don't come here.

151
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,460
Don't crowd the stage.

152
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,500
Move away.

153
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,220
What are you doing?

154
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,660
Let me stick. Just one, just one.

155
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,180
I will call the police if you do this again.

156
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,780
What are you doing?

157
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,930
Who is this?

158
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,770
Mu Tingzhou.

159
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,980
It's true.

160
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,290
It's Mu Tingzhou.

161
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,900
You mean the Best Actor is here?

162
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Why is he here?

163
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,780
Your Highness, I'm late for your protection.

164
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,460
Are you okay?

165
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,060
Grand Tutor,

166
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,820
I'm fine.

167
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,170
Grand Tutor.

168
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,500
Grand Tutor, what are you doing? Release me quickly.

169
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,180
Come.

170
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,300
Grand Tutor. Let me down quickly.

171
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,090
What are you doing?

172
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,740
I'm afraid I cannot let you down.

173
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,340
Everybody.

174
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,890
This is the biggest surprise

175
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,900
I prepared for today,

176
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,250
inviting Mr. Mu, the Best Actor to my wedding.

177
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,220
Mr. Mu,

178
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,100
thanks for coming to congratulate me in person.

179
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,460
I'm a big fan of you.

180
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,460
And I'm a best friend of Ming Wei.

181
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,580
Such a evil and

182
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,460
mean woman

183
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,620
dares to claim yourself a best friend of Your Highness.

184
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,140
You don't deserve it.

185
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,740
Wei should be Mu Tingzhou's girlfriend.

186
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,940
I didn't imagine that he is the overbearing CEO style.

187
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,180
I'm turning to his fan now.

188
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,460
Why does everybody leave?

189
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,660
So irritating!

190
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,570
Grand Tutor, I'm in the car now.

191
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,780
Can you loosen me up?

192
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,540
Grand Tutor, I don't feel well in this condition.

193
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,980
I really don't feel well.

194
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,650
Grand Tutor, loosen me up.

195
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,490
Please.

196
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,020
According to Commandments for Women,

197
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,020
women should behave elegantly and calmly, guard chastity, model each act on the best usage and wear neat clothes.

198
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,420
As a princess,

199
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,020
you are belittling yourself regardless of your reputation.

200
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,860
This really makes me sad.

201
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,060
Well, what?

202
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,780
How... how did I neglect my reputation?

203
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,420
How did I belittle myself?

204
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,660
You expose too much skin, Your Highness.

205
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,940
This is not what a nice lady should do.

206
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,780
Xiao Zhao.

207
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,100
Be a judge here.

208
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,770
Am I exposing too much skin?

209
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,500
Xiao Zhao is an outsider.

210
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,130
How can you be so frivolous?

211
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,620
Say something, Xiao Zhao.

212
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm not frivolous, am I?

213
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,340
How am I frivolous?

214
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,980
Calm down, you two.

215
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,540
Please tolerate it, Your Highness.

216
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,420
Don't rush to break this.

217
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,460
We can talk after

218
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,740
we settle down and have a seat.

219
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,740
OK?

220
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,580
Don't spy.

221
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,820
What are you doing? I'm driving.

222
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,500
Are you okay, Your Highness?

223
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,220
No, not okay.

224
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,100
Xiaoya, Xiaoya.

225
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,370
Don't cry, Xiaoya.

226
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,500
It's okay.

227
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,820
-Alright, alright. -Honey.

228
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,620
It's okay.

229
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,540
Don't cry.

230
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,300
There, there.

231
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,300
There, there. Don't cry.

232
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,250
Our whole wedding is ruined by Ming Wei.

233
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,900
Don't cry.

234
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,020
Alright. Don't be mad.

235
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,700
Look.

236
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,260
Ming Wei and Mu Tingzhou are on the news.

237
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,140
This.

238
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,460
Alright. Alright.

239
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,420
Don't take it seriously.

240
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,410
[#Newbie Ming Wei netted the Best Actor#]

241
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,300
The Best Actor Mu Tingzhou

242
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,690
took a bridesmaid in front of the crowd.

243
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,010
[Princess]

244
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,380
Bridesmaid.

245

[#Profile of the Best Actor's Suspected Girlfriend#]

246
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,380
Look, look.

247
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,970
[You are my princess.]

248
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,770
Who is this woman?

249
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,580
I heard that she is the heroine of the new play of the Best Actor.

250
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,180
Don't tell me that!

251
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,420
Hurry up and give me the solution.

252
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,940
This way.

253
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,330
Prepare the documents for me first.

254
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,860
If anyone starts to expose info of Ming Wei on the official account,

255
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,100
control the situation immediately.

256
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,740
If anyone dares to guide the public opinion,

257
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,100
inform me immediately, understand?

258
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,530
OK.

259
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,860
After we reach a conclusion through discussion,

260
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,460
we will definitely give the media a reply.

261
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,090
OK.

262
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,500
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

263
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,660
Sorry for the trouble.

264
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,260
OK.

265
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,900
Everything is supposed to be done

266
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,060
according to the planned schedule.

267
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,100
The press briefing will be held tomorrow for the official announcement.

268
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,340
Why did such a thing happen?

269
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,420
Why didn't you stop Tingzhou?

270
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,380
I couldn't.

271
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,130
I could neither persuade him, nor defeat him.

272
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,420
My career

273
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,180
almost collapsed

274
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,490
in the past week.

275
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,940
This is a shock, ok?

276
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,180
Hello, honey.

277
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,900
Right, right, right.

278
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,020
It's so urgent.

279
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,450
That's why I'm asking you

280
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,780
to suppress this immediately.

281
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,620
Hello.

282
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
You misunderstood, dad.

283
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,460
Mu Tingzhou is not my boyfriend.

284
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,380
Delete as many as those documents possible.

285
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,340
Well, it's a small issue.

286
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,580
I just saw it.

287
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,500
Wait a minute.

288
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,420
And the news of Tingzhou.

289
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,540
OK. OK. I owe you. I owe you.

290
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,420
I will treat you dinner, honey.

291
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,050
Yes, yes. Delete it. Delete it.

292
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,980
What Princess and Grand Tutor?

293
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,260
He just thinks you are beautiful

294
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,300
and pretends it to pester you.

295
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,980
Wei.

296
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,730
I understand your concern,

297
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,180
but...

298
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,500
I seriously doubt that his intention is ill.

299
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,780
No, dad.

300
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,690
He was gentle

301
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,900
before he lost his memory.

302
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,099
And now he kneels down for me frequently.

303
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,540
You say it,

304
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,380
what normal people do that?

305
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,050
I bet he never did that to his parents.

306
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,180
Wei, listen to me.

307
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,569
Don't get involved in this.

308
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,420
Wei,

309
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,210
or we can quit acting, ok?

310
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,820
Mom,

311
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,060
I like acting.

312
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,740
I think

313
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,380
it is more interesting than translation.

314
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,860
Alright.

315
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
Just be careful.

316
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,450
Don't worry about us.

317
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,300
Dad, mom,

318
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
don't worry.

319
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,420
The agency

320
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,060
will handle it for me.

321
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,460
I will definitely protect myself.

322
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,940
I will go back and visit you

323
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,700
after this period.

324
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,580
Don't worry.

325
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,260
Are you worried that

326
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,740
her biological father will see it?

327
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,290
No matter what happens,

328
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,420
four members of our family

329
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,020
will be together forever.

330
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,060
I will always protect you three.

331
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,820
Ming Qiang.

332
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,540
I'm still worried.

333
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,940
What if we go to visit Wei?

334
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,930
I really worry that she will be harmed,

335
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,140
since she just became an actress for a short time.

336
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,100
Don't worry.

337
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,740
I will handle this.

338
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,100
Please have some tea, Your Highness.

339
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,460
Thank you.

340
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,170
Your Highness,

341
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,580
I have made some mistakes.

342
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,700
What are your mistakes?

343
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,300
I didn't protect you well

344
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,900
and let you be harassed by those

345
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,380
I should have sent them to prison.

346
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,810
But I think,

347
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,800
the clothes Your Highness wore at that time

348
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,880
was destructive to the morals

349
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,090
and not proper.

350
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
The late Emperor assigned me as your tutor,

351
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,490
and I think I have the responsibility to guide and teach you.

352
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,450
I think

353
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,460
I'm not wrong on this point.

354
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,900
Grand Tutor,

355
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,380
my thoughts are contrary to yours.

356
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,980
You fought for me

357
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,890
when others harassed me.

358
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,300
I was quite moved.

359
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,410
You did nothing wrong.

360
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,890
But

361
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,860
about the clothes,

362
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,660
I think

363
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,250
you don't really know modern clothes.

364
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,900
These are clothes for modern ladies.

365
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,900
And mine is

366
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,660
just normal.

367
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,490
You are a princess, Your Highness.

368
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,660
How could you compare yourself with ordinary ladies?

369
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,940
There are principles for a princess.

370
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,260
Grand Tutor,

371
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,460
look at this.

372
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,620
You keep persuading me

373
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,020
not to expose my body.

374
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,060
But people from all over the country has

375
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,690
seen this picture of yours.

376
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,420
Don't you

377
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,060
need to watch out of your own reputation?

378
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,850
Or

379
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,930
men from the past

380
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,220
can show their bodies to the public and

381
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,290
let other people watch.

382
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,250
Actually,

383
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,860
you have a good body

384
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,980
that is better than many other models.

385
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,810
Your Highness, please be careful with your words.

386
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,580
I am just your minister and you are Your Highness.

387
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,090
We should not be mentioned in the same breath.

388
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,900
Grand Tutor,

389
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,860
you really have a double standard.

390
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
If we need to follow the etiquette of the past,

391
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,420
I am not allowed to show myself to the public.

392
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
If we follow your logic,

393
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,700
why would you want to be my assistant?

394
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,500
Would it be better to

395
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,540
send me to The Forbidden City,

396
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
and let a couple of palace maids and eunuchs to take care of me?

397
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,970
It is not because I do not want to,

398
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,520
it's me being useless.

399
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,980
I cannot change the lustrous and dazzling reality;

400
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,090
cannot give the honor of Your Highness back or

401
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,820
provide Your Highness a carefree and lighthearted life.

402
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,820
The only thing I can do is

403
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,660
to stand by your side

404
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,930
and to protect you for whole life.

405
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,580
Grand Tutor,

406
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,660
if you really want to stay by my side and protect me,

407
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
you need to learn to

408
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,290
adapt to this world.

409
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,900
Otherwise,

410
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,380
how could you keep your promise?

411
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,210
I just saw Ms. Shen and Xiao Zhao

412
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,930
have got extra work to do because of the mistakes we made.

413
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,140
It makes me feel guilty.

414
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,220
I don't know what you are thinking.

415
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,980
No matter what,

416
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,380
I feel that

417
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,930
in order for us to

418
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,300
cooperate continuously,

419
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,980
we have to make some rules.

420
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,740
You are not in the mood?

421
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,100
I cannot be happy about anything.

422
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,540
It looks like you are confused from what happened today.

423
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,780
Ms. Shen,

424
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,460
I was just a outsider when I

425
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,380
heard the scandals

426
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,580
and fake news

427
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,660
of the celebrities.

428
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,540
I never thought

429
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,700
that this kind of things would have fallen upon my head.

430
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,380
I am really muddled.

431
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,980
You need to get used to it.

432
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,900
I want to be a actress who has good acting skills

433
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,180
and who is brilliant at acting,

434
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,460
not only a celebrity with scandals.

435
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,140
More slanders you have suffered from,

436
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,700
more praises you are worthy of.

437
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,700
Since you cannot avoid it,

438
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,860
you would need to consider it as a test.

439
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,500
It's press conference tomorrow,

440
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,660
buck up!

441
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,180
Alright.

442
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,540
Okay, I know.

443
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,370
See you at the conference tomorrow.

444
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,050
Have a early rest.

445
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,820
Thanks for all the work.

446
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,300
What are you thinking?

447
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,460
I am thinking

448
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,260
why I am here in this world.

449
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,540
In this world,

450
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,140
I am always the trouble.

451
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,060
I cannot do the things I want to do, and I

452
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,740
cannot protect the people

453
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
I want to protect.

454
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,020
First of all,

455
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,810
no more getting down on your knees.

456
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,500
It is not allowed at anytime.

457
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,210
Secondarily,

458
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,900
you can talk to me

459
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,300
and we can discuss in a calm mood

460
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,940
when you think

461
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,900
I am wrong.

462
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,890
But,

463
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,980
I have the authority to

464
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,380
take charge of my own behaviors.

465
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,980
You cannot force me to do anything

466
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,290
when there is no result of the discussion,

467
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,580
including what kind of clothes I wear.

468
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,980
It's fine if you don't agree,

469
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,530
then we will only mind our own businesses.

470
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,580
Your Highness.

471
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,300
Your Highness.

472
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
You have agreed?

473
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,290
I agree,

474
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,060
but Your Highness, please also keep your promises that

475
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,940
you must tell me first

476
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,860
no matter what you are

477
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,050
planning on doing.

478
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,820
Alright, let's meet each other halfway.

479
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,340
Besides these two points,

480
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,340
what else do you need me to do, Your Highness?

481
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,500
Grand Tutor,

482
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,260
I know you think of me

483
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,500
as the princess.

484
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,740
But,

485
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,780
between the sexes there should be a prudent reserve.

486
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,820
From now on,

487
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,180
you need to act cold against me,

488
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,260
do not talk to me if you don't need to,

489
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,930
no body contact either.

490
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,020
Otherwise,

491
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,410
we are unable to give a convincing explanation if other people see us.

492
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,970
In your opinion,

493
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,420
am I

494
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,620
unreasonable?

495
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,260
Yes.

496
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
But you don't listen to reasons because

497
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,220
your thinking is from the past times and

498
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,900
it is incompatible with the modern world.

499
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,820
Tingzhou.

500
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,380
I have to call you Tingzhou.

501
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,090
Even though you don't recognize it,

502
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,330
I still want to tell you that

503
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,500
you are ill actually.

504
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,740
You are not physcially ill

505
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,340
but psychologically.

506
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,860
No matter you are Mu Yun or Mu Tingzhou,

507
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,050
you are my brother.

508
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
No matter where you came from,

509
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,260
and where will you be in the future,

510
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,940
I will always be by your side.

511
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,260
Don't over think,

512
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,460
and relax.

513
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,220
Steward Xiao,

514
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,100
you are a person of loyalty and righteousness.

515
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,380
If there is an opportunity,

516
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,340
I would deliver a piece of advice to His Majesty and

517
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,020
offer you a general post and confer a title of nobility.

518
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,340
Alright.

519
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,180
Thank you, Grand Tutor.

520
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:01,960
[Weibo]

521
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,580
Hello, everyone.

522
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,220
I am actress Ming Wei.

523
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,420
Grand Chief Cabinet Minister

524
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,140
is the first TV series I am in.

525
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
It's my honor to

526
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,740
cooperate with Mr. Mu

527
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,420
and other seniors.

528
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,980
I am deeply sorry

529
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,740
by knowing the situation of Mr. Mu's illness,

530
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
the only thing I can do

531
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,300
is to cooperate with his treatment following doctor's notes.

532
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,620
Here I promise,

533
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,180
I will respect him always

534
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,780
no matter

535
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,740
he is the best actor or Grand Tutor.

536
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,980
Please help to maintain

537
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,250
a good public opinion environment.

538
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,300
Hope Mr. Mu will recover his memories soon and

539
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,580
come up with more excellent works.

540
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,300
First of all,

541
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,460
I need to thank media and the public on behalf of Tingzhou

542
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,940
[I suddenly feel that the setting is romantic, looking forward to see what happens next.]

543
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,660
for all the good care he has received.

544
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,830
[This is an official announcement?]

545
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,260
[I have to say that it is so handsome of Grand Tutor to save the beauty at the wedding scene.]

546
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,020
During this period of time,

547
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,040
[Can someone tell me what happened?]

548
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,020
we are touched by

549
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,740
all the good wishes.

550
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,260
Now, I need to give my special thanks to Ming Wei.

551
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,330
Tingzhou thinks of himself as the Grand Tutor.

552
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,980
Many thoughts of his

553
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,260
are antiquated idea of the past times,

554
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,660
including the video yesterday.

555
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,170
[Wake up, husband, I am your real princess.]

556
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,620
It is because Tingzhou thought it is inappropriate for the

557
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,090
[Please be alright soon.]

558
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,780
princess to wear that gown,

559
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,950
[How lucky Ming Wei is, I am so jealous.]

560
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,570
so he took her away from the sight and caused

561
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,980
the chaos at the scene.

562
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,970
It sounds ridiculous.

563
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,380
Tingzhou became like this,

564
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,740
and Ming Wei's life and work

565
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,260
are affected.

566
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,940
We apologize here

567
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,700
and also give thanks to Ming Wei.

568
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,980
We hope everyone who likes Tingzhou can

569
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,740
support Ming Wei more,

570
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,020
and do not give her the pressure

571
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,500
of public opinions.

572
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,820
What is it?

573
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,940
I want to speak to my media friends that

574
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,430
Tingzhou is a public figure

575
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,250
[Oh my God, this is going to be an official announcement? Be my princess?]

576
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,260
who receives attentions

577
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,900
that is one of the obligations

578
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,100
coming from his acting career.

579
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,620
If everything is normal with Tingzhou....

580
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,060
It's not a surprise that she stopped badgering,

581
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,340
I thought she was innocent,

582
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,940
it turned out that she got her hands on Mu Tingzhou.

583
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,220
Please give Tingzhou some privacy and

584
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,500
some time to recover.

585
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,860
You are better than her.

586
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,820
If Tingzhou's condition is deteriorated because

587
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,540
he is pushed too hard from some media.

588
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,290
We will appeal to the law

589
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,140
and there must be accountability.

590
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,630
[Follow, Ming Wei.]

591
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,460
Your Highness,

592
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,980
no matter how cruel

593
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,170
the outside world is,

594
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,130
I will try my best to protect you,

595
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,780
maintain your noble status and

596
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,810
make you carefree and lighthearted.

597
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,580
Sir.

598
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,580
let's go.

599
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,330
You dress so formally.

600
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,700
Are you attending a red-carpet event?

601
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
We are going to the Princess Palace.

602
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,700
Let's go.

603
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,260
Your Highness, please enjoy the meal.

604
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,660
Why do I feel a bit dizzy,

605
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,220
being spoiled like this?

606
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,660
You are a great entertainment agent.

607
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,460
But you are forced to work like an actor.

608
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,450
It must be tough for you.

609
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,610
Thank you for your understanding. I'm getting used to it.

610
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,300
Come and join me, guys.

611
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,460
In order to respect Your Highness,

612
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,460
we can only eat

613
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,980
after Your Highness have finished your meal.

614
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,060
Your Highness,

615
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,500
please enjoy.

616
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,610
Grand Tutor,

617
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,420
I have told you

618
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,580
that all humans are equal in the modern society.

619
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,380
We can all eat and talk

620
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,500
at the same table.

621
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,860
No, we cannot.

622
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,820
This is the first time I've seen an alive ancient man.

623
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,699
My goodness.

624
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:41,690
Fine.

625
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,900
I've got plenty of time today.

626
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,889
If you don't eat, then I won't eat.

627
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:46,980
Your Highness,

628
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,250
please be reasonable.

629
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:50,929
We have different statuses.

630
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,220
Let's eat.

631
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,820
Come on.

632
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,860
Dig in.

633
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,580
Your Highness first.

634
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,580
Let's eat.

635
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,900
Have some soup, Grand Tutor.

636
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

637
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:11,900
Have some.

638
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,250
Sister, I'm done.

639
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,900
I have some things to do at school. I have to go now.

640
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,780
Thanks for the meal.

641
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,140
Grand Tutor.

642
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,380
See you.

643
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:29,780
Bye, Sister.

644
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,140
Be careful on the road. Bye.

645
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,580
Your Highness, allow me please.

646
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
I will just put them in the sink.

647
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,300
Ming Wei,

648
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,260
just leave them there.

649
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,140
Let him do it.

650
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,140
Bye the way,

651
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,740
what are you going to wear

652
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,860
for your training class?

653
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,140
I

654
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,540
will just wear a jacket

655
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
and put on a pair of jeans.

656
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,740
No.

657
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,740
You two have just announced your relations.

658
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,660
The reporters are gonna pay close attention to you

659
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,260
over the next few days.

660
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,700
If an actress shows bad taste in clothes,

661
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,100
it could be bad publicity.

662
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,580
If you don't mind,

663
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,500
can I

664
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,500
take a look at your wardrobe?

665
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,940
Yes, sure.

666
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,500
No, you cannot.

667
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,260
Grand Tutor,

668
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,650
Xiao Zhao is just helping me put together an outfit.

669
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,660
Don't worry.

670
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,660
I will sort out my closet first

671
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,540
to make sure all things are appropriate.

672
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,660
A consort kin is not allowed

673
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,380
to be in Your Highness's bedroom.

674
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,140
Please bring your clothes out here, Your Highness.

675
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,940
Steward Xiao.

676
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,020
I...

677
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,330
Are these all of your clothes?

678
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,020
Grand Tutor. Uh...

679
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,250
Your Highness, please choose whatever you like.

680
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,780
I have brought enough cash.

681
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,780
Grand Tutor, this isn't appropriate, is it?

682
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,450
This...

683
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,380
this is so lavish.

684
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,940
Just treat it as your life experience.

685
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,540
My life experience?

686
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,580
This is the life experience

687
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,060
of the heroine in a Korean drama, right?

688
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,020
Don't you know his personalities?

689
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,900
It's better for you to pick your own clothes

690
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,060
than let him choose randomly.

691
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,260
The latter will cost more money.

692
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,940
Your Highness.

693
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,900
After you.

694
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,020
Welcome to our store.

695
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:33,980
Please come inside.

696
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,580
Your Highness.

697
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,890
After you.

698
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,260
Go ahead.

699
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,060
All of them are so pretty.

700
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,620
I don't know which pair to choose.

701
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,090
[Bank Card]

702
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,740
Excuse me, are you Ming Wei?

703
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:41,660
Sorry.

704
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,820
You've mistaken me for someone else.

705
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,620
You are Ming Wei.

706
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,860
I like you so much.

707
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,700
I'm a fan of yours.

708
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,420
Can I have your autograph, please?

709
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,380
Do you really like Ming Wei?

710
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,330
Yes, of course.

711
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,140
I've been following you on Weibo

712
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,300
since you were a Han costume model.

713
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,260
You really are

714
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,260
my favorite actress.

715
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,180
I will sign for you.

716
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,200
Sh!

717
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,980
Thank you, Princess Ming Wei.

718
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,940
Who dares

719
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,220
to approach Her Highness in broad daylight?
