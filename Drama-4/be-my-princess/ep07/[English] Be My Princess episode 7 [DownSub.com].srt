00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,260
I will ask Tingzhou's nanny, Auntie Zhao,

46

to take care of Her Highness's living.

47
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,180

48

No need.

it is for the best that I take care of Her Highness myself.

51

I'm fine on my own.

Her Highness is royal,

55

and she's female while you are male,

56
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,500
so I think that

57
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,060
it is more proper that

in this different world.

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,050
one of them is mine,

81
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,770
and Xu Lin occasionally comes to live in the other one.

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,420
Who is Xu Lin?

83
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
You won't recall it anyway,

84
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,490
so let's talk about this later.

85
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,450
This whole floor is yours.

86
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,580
This is your bedroom.

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,380
This is the study.

88
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,300
Over there is the bathroom,

89
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,010
which has a whole set of sanitary equipment.

90
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,420
And deeper inside

91
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,780
is your gym.

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
What is a gym?

93
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,260
A gym is where you exercise

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,140
your muscles to build your body.

95
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,820
So it is a Martial Arts practice range.

96
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,460
It also makes sense

97
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,370

104
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,930
come near him,

105
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,540
he becomes very alert,

106
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,530
and more intense in his nerves.

107
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,620
This will make his illness even worse.

108

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,570
I have said that

191
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,180
I'm not the princess.

192
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,900
I have also said for many times

193
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,700
that you are the princess of the Ning Dynasty.

194
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,080
It is quite late.

195
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,490
What do you call me for?

196
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,900
I want to know

197
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,540
how long has Your Highness been here?

198
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,530
I was born on October 18,

199
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,060
1998.

200
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,740
Native Chinese citizen.

201
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,300
My hometown is Su City.

202
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,820
I'm 23 years old.

203
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,740
Your Highness still look like 15,

204
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,900
not 23.

205
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,140
That is because 23-year-old me

206
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,170
played the role of 15-year-old princess.

207
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,700
Your Highness.

208
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,820
I'm very sad that

209
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
you can't retrieve your memory.

210
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,060
I just wish to find out

211
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,900
the wicked people that poisoned us

212
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,340
and press him for antidote.

213
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,020
And then I will lock him up in prison and interrogate him with heavy punishment.

214
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,900
Don't be so sad.

215
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,660
Grand Tutor.

216
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,220
Are you alright?

217
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,450
I'm fine.

218
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,020
Your Highness,

219
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,420
what do you do for a living here?

220
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,740
I used to be an interpreter.

221
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,530
I have just started acting lately.

222
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,860
The Grand Chief Cabinet Minister

223
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,330
is the first show I shot together with Mr. Mu.

224
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,850
I have something to do.

225
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,140
Excuse me, Your Highness.

226
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,740
Grand Tutor, you have finished your phone call?

227
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,420
What is it this time, Mu Tingzhou?

228
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,900
Why did you let Her Highness be a playactor?

229
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,260
Playactor?

230
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,370
I...

231
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,020
Talk.

232
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,180
In this era,

233
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,140
actors are respectable.

234
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,900
Ming Wei loves acting.

235
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,860
This is her personal choice.

236
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,100
There's nothing I can interfere with.

237
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,900
Others can do this, but not Her Highness.

238
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,020
Ordinary people must get on their knees when they see Her Highness,

239
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,450
how dare they see Her Highness casually?

240
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,140
Say it, how many shows has Her Highness been on?

241
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,140
Only one, the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister, with you.

242
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
It is undergoing post production,

243
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,740
and will be aired next year.

244
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,650
No airing.

245
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,860
Her Highness is royal and superior.

246
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,610
I won't allow you to treat her with levity.

247
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,220
I'm sorry but

248
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,260
here in this world,

249
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,650
you are not Grand Tutor.

250
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,620
You can't control anybody.

251
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,120
I must have owed you a lot in the previous life.

252
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,810
Ming Wei and you

253
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,220
both signed the shooting contract.

254
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,210
Even if you can persuade Ming Wei

255
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,220
to leave the acting industry,

256
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,780
the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister will still be aired as planned.

257
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,060
Besides, this is a serious drama.

258
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,500
It mainly shows what happened on the imperial court.

259
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,660
Ming Wei played the role of princess, and she was conservative in dressing.

260
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,100
Except for that scene with you and her...

261
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,580
Shut up.

262
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,980
Her Highness is as clean as ice and as pure as jade.

263
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,500
How dare you profane her?

264
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,380
Who is profaning her?

265
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,180
What are you doing?

266
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,060
Calm down.

267
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,770
It is my fault, OK?

268
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,100
Don't be rash.

269
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,420
I'm a criminal offending Her Highness.

270
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,380
I should kill myself as an apology.

271
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,060
You shot it through a protective film.

272
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
With a protective film.

273
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,740
Calm down.

274
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,940
Even if I didn't have intimate relations with Her Highness,

275
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,100
it was still great disrespect.

276
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,060
Her Highness can't shoot scenes like this in the future.

277
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,980
Then talk to her entertainment agent.

278
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,460
I will say it again.

279
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,980
We are friends,

280
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,300
so I can be understanding at all events.

281
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,220
But Ming Wei and Shen Su don't owe you anything.

282
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,540
I suggest you think it through before going,

283
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
or you may be rejected.

284
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,580
Even if I didn't have intimate relations with Her Highness,

285
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,740
it was still great disrespect.

286
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,740
Her Highness can't shoot scenes like this in the future.

287
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,810
A play

288
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,980
needs to be dramatic.

289
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,140
The plots of our relationship

290
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,980
have been emphasized by the scriptwriter.

291
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,380
Grand Tutor. Grand Tutor.

292
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,620
Grand Tutor.

293
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,740
Why didn't you answer me?

294
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,220
Any order, Your Highness?

295
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,100
Yesterday, Pingxi Royal Highness went to see the Empress Dowager

296
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,180
and asked to marry me.

297
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,580
Do you know that?

298
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,100
Congratulations, Your Highness.

299
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,900
His Royal Highness is not only royal and superior,

300
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
his talents are also outstanding.

301
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,050
Shut up.

302
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,620
He's going to make a perfect couple

303
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,410
with Your Highness.

304
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,860
Shut up, didn't you hear me?

305
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,330
So

306
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,740
you don't care at all, right?

307
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,500
I don't know what you mean, Your Highness.

308
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,460
You don't care at all

309
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,460
that I'm going to marry His Royal Highness.

310
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,700
If I marry him,

311
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,140
one obstacle will be eliminated for you,

312
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,620
so that you can marry that invalid

313
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,660
without any difficulty, right?

314
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,700
Looking at all the royal princes on the imperial court,

315
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,420
there's no one who can compete with His Royal Highness Xu in quality and appearance.

316
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,100
I personally think that

317
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,820
this is really a good match.

318
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,500
Please consider it carefully, Your Highness.

319
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,900
Don't reject easily.

320
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,820
OK.

321
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,380
It's good for you.

322
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,620
If there's no other order, Your Highness,

323
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,740
I will leave you be.

324
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,730
I hate you.

325
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,220
I will hate you for the rest of my life.

326
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,740
I won't forgive you, ever.

327
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,220
Do you hear me?

328
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,540
I hate you.

329
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,370
Why does this scene feel so real?

330
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,140
[Agent Penalty]

331
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,220
Who is this?

332
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,820
She said she is Auntie Zhao.

333
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,140
Pretty girls,

334
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,130
please come have breakfast.

335
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,180
Hello, Auntie Zhao.

336
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,340
Hello, Auntie Zhao.

337
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,860
Hi.

338
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,980
Come here.

339
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,420
Auntie Zhao, we...

340
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,770
There are only two of us.

341
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,020
This is too much for breakfast.

342
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,820
We can't finish it.

343
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,860
Why don't we eat it together?

344
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,980
I have already had my breakfast.

345
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,860
I didn't know what you like

346
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,740
so I prepared

347
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,900
all of them.

348
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,170
Come over.

349
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
Come and have a seat. Enjoy your breakfast.

350
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,220
Come.

351
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,820
Have a seat.

352
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,780
Come here.

353
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,820
Just sit.

354
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,410
Auntie Zhao.

355
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,980
Sorry to bother you.

356
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,820
I appreciate it very much.

357
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,860
You are welcome.

358
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,660
You are so beautiful, nice,

359
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,220
and kind.

360
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,820
Mr. Mu is so lucky

361
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,260
to be with you.

362
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,060
It's not what you think, Auntie Zhao.

363
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,810
Mr. Mu is a senior colleague to me.

364
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,860
We have acted in the same show before.

365
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,340
Well, I am speaking from personal experience.

366
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,210
I have been working at his place for years,

367
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,180
I know what this is about.

368
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,050
Well, I...

369
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,420
It's okay. Enjoy your breakfast.

370
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,980
Sure, thanks.

371
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,340
Just eat your food.

372
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,620
There's too much food.

373
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,900
Mom never cooked this much for us.

374
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,420
Mom cooks?

375
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,620
How come I didn't know about that?

376
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,820
Well, I had better drink this coffee.

377
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,860
See how beautiful the sunshine is today!

378
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,820
I'll take your quilts out

379
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,620
to air them.

380
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,020
Well, Auntie Zhao,

381
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,820
let us do it.

382
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,620
Don't bother.

383
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,740
See, I woke up early to prepare the breakfast

384
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,930
for you to have more.

385
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,580
Enjoy it before it gets cold.

386
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,820
Don't make me sad.

387
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,980
Make yourself at home.

388
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,020
Thanks, Auntie Zhao.

389
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,820
Go.

390
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,020
Grand Tutor.

391
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,860
I... I...

392
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,300
What's the matter?

393
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,660
Auntie Zhao came back.

394
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,810
Don't you have something to ask her?

395
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,980
Mr. Mu.

396
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,450
Madam Zhao.

397
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,730
You went to her place.

398
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,500
Was Her Highness satisfied with it?

399
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,620
Of course.

400
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,460
I did what you said,

401
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,780
starting from the most difficult chores.

402
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,380
The two girls were quite satisfied with everything

403
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,780
this whole morning.

404
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,820
Thank you, Madam Zhao.

405
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,900
Grand Tutor.

406
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:00,850
Don't forget that

407
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,060
it's a time when people are all equal.

408
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,890
No one is born to do chores.

409
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,070
It's okay.

410
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,020
I'm really happy that

411
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,230
he has learnt to dote on others.

412
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,500
Sir,

413
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,580
that lady not only has a good look

414
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,580
but also has a good temper and good manners.

415
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,620
You have good taste, Sir.

416
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,140
I'm Grand Tutor, Mu Yun,

417
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,340
not that Sir.

418
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,460
Yes, Grand Tutor.

419
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,620
Steward Xiao,

420
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,740
come upstairs later.

421
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,020
Don't take it to heart, Auntie Zhao.

422
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,500
Tingzhou is ill.

423
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,460
He even doesn't recognize his parents and me.

424
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,020
But he must have not meant that.

425
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,900
I've been working for him for years.

426
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,060
I know him well.

427
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,980
You say he has a mental issue.

428
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,020
In my view,

429
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,540
he just takes it too far in the character.

430
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,300
At the end of the day,

431
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,540
he just has a crush on that Princess.

432
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,940
Others see him as a Prince Charming,

433
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,860
but his life is plain and boring.

434
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,500
No love or desires.

435
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,500
What's the point of it?

436
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,260
Now he has a crush on someone,

437
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,740
I'm more than happy to see that!

438
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,340
Let's wait and see how he gets his Princess.

439
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,410
OK.

440
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,020
Auntie Zhao, you really are experienced.

441
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,980
An old ox makes a straight furrow.

442
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,500
Grand Tutor, you asked to see me.

443
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,780
I watched some of your shows last night.

444
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,460
Many of them are immoral.

445
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,740
I want to know

446
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,660
if all of the shows here

447
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,180
are such

448
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,020
an eyesore.

449
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,620
You learn it quickly.

450
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,980
Now you even know the word "eyesore“.

451
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,930
Her Highness is royalty.

452
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,450
I won't let any man take advantage of her

453
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,140
with the excuse of acting.

454
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,410
But you were the first one who took advantage of her, weren't you?

455
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,580
Well, not all the shows

456
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,220
have intimate scenes.

457
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,740
For example, you...

458
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,060
No,

459
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,060
Mu Tingzhou

460
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,980
never took parts in this kind of shows before.

461
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,460
So it's the actor and the agent

462
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,370
who need to reach an agreement.

463
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,540
In that way, the agent will check the script

464
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,140
before accepting the show.

465
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,890
However, Ming Wei is a novice in this industry.

466
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,260
It's not good for her to be so picky on the shows.

467
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,580
In your words,

468
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
as long as I become the agent of Her Highness,

469
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,140
I could protect her.

470
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:57,820
Last night,

471
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
I carried out thorough research on how to be an entertainment agent.

472
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,260
I have made up my mind,

473
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,940
from now on,

474
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,360
I'll be the agent for Her Highness.

475
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,290
I told you

476
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,660
she has already got an agent,

477
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,540
Shen Su,

478
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,940
a top agent from a top agent firm.

479
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,140
They have signed the agent contract.

480
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,140
Compensation is needed if anyone breaches the contract.

481
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,620
How much is the compensation?

482
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,540
No matter how much it is,

483
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,780
I'll pay for Her Highness.

484
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,460
You?

485
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,580
No, Grand Tutor.

486
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,020
Are you sure you brought money with you

487
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,980
when you time traveled

488
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,420
from the Ning Dynasty?

489
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,620
Since you said that

490
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,820
actors have a high social status in this world

491
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,940
and earn much,

492
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,860
it will not be a big deal

493
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,300
to pay the compensation.

494
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,300
So you are thinking about

495
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,650
using Mu Tingzhou's money

496
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,300
to pay for Grand Tutor?

497
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,580
Grand Tutor, when you were saying that,

498
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,900
didn't you feel guilty?

499
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,860
It's you who keeps emphasizing that

500
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,020
Mu Tingzhou and I are actually the same person.

501
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,860
Given that,

502
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,700
why can't I spend his money?

503
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,540
Alright, fine.

504
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,420
No. Grand Tutor.

505
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,140
Being an entertainment agent

506
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,460
is not something you can do well

507
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,330
just by staying up and surfing the internet.

508
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,580
Taking me as an example,

509
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,660
not only do I have to take care of your clothing, food, housing and transportation,

510
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,100
I also need to help you with contract negotiation

511
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,740
and script selection.

512
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,500
I meet the people you don't want to see.

513
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,580
I do the things you don't care to do.

514
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,620
If you fall sick,

515
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,820
I take all the responsibilities without complaint

516
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,620
and help you deal with all the trouble.

517
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,730
In the end, you may not even appreciate it at all.

518
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,340
See?

519
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,460
This is the life of an entertainment agent.

520
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,500
Do you want the Princess to hate you,

521
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
and get the opposite of what you really want?

522
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,740
However,

523
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,460
I do have an idea to help you do this in another way.

524
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,780
What do you want to exchange?

525
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Tell me.

526
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,660
As long as I can protect Her Highness by her side

527
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,220
I will agree to whatever you say.

528
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,340
What?

529
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,610
Mr. Mu wants to be my personal assistant?

530
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,380
Ming Wei,

531
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,980
don't feel pressured.

532
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,300
It seems like Tingzhou is hired by you,

533
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,780
but actually in this way

534
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,340
it is good for his treatment,

535
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,700
so you don't have to pay him salary.

536
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,940
Instead, the Mus will give you a bunch of money

537
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,860
to show their appreciation.

538
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,660
No. No. No.

539
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,210
I don't need compensation.

540
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,700
It has nothing to do with money.

541
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,180
Please don't get mad at me,

542
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,540
I feel like your requests

543
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,580
is way too much.

544
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,540
Putting others aside,

545
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,260
if people see,

546
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,620
Mu Tingzhou, the Best Actor,

547
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,740
keeping a close relationship

548
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,820
with the new actress

549
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,260
and even serving her,

550
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,780
it will make a huge negative impact on Ming Wei.

551
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,460
I'm sure you understand.

552
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,340
Sure.

553
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,780
We have considered it.

554
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,460
So once I get your approval,

555
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,780
Tingzhou's parents and I

556
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,260
will hold a press conference

557
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,450
to make Tingzhou's illness

558
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
known to the public.

559
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,610
What do you think of it?

560
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,740
But

561
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,060
I feel that

562
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,940
Mr. Mu won't agree to

563
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,900
these requests.

564
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,820
Although he is the Grand Tutor now,

565
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,980
but when he regains his memory,

566
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,270
he will be angry.

567
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,620
Anyway, it's what the Grand Tutor wants to do,

568
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,430
not Mr. Mu.

569
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,460
Although Tingzhou is a stubborn person,

570
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,810
he can tell right from wrong.

571
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,460
We could put this

572
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,820
into the contract,

573
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,540
to try to minimize

574
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,820
the negative impact on you.

575
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,980
We will protect you

576
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,380
in legal and moral ways.

577
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,740
If you don't mind,

578
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,740
I could be your associate assistant

579
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,140
so I could provide professional services

580
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,370
and look after Tingzhou at the same time

581
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,380
to make sure you can work and live normally.

582
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,060
Your Highness.

583
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,210
Save your formality from now on.

584
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,220
It's not good to be seen by others.

585
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
Yes.

586
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,140
Let's get in the car.

587
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,900
Alright.

588
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,340
Your Highness, please.

589
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,300
Thanks.

590
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,560
Your Highness, this way please.

591
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,420
Thank you.

592
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Your Highness, have some water.

593
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:06,700
Thank you.

594
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,140
Your Highness, please don't stand on ceremony.

595
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,100
Your Highness, let me get that for you.

596
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,300
Your Highness, the seat may be uncomfortable.

597
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,620
You can put this pillow around your waist.

598
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,860
Thank you.

599
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,180
That works too.

600
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,460
Steward Xiao,

601
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,060
drive slower.

602
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,300
Grand Tutor,

603
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,980
I appreciate what you've done for me.

604
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,060
But why are you doing this?

605
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,380
It's difficult being an artiste's assistant.

606
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,020
You have to get water for me when I'm thirsty,

607
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,180
and bring food to me when I'm hungry.

608
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,180
Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood,

609
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,970
I might even take it out on you.

610
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,050
This is my duty,

611
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,860
I do not want others to do it for me.

612
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,620
But

613
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,020
if you do this,

614
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,980
I will be spoiled.

615
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,260
Your Highness is precious,

616
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,180
you should be loved by the world.

617
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,220
So what if you are spoiled?

618
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,900
Is he flirting with me?

619
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,380
About that...

620
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,890
Grand Tutor.

621
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,020
Didn't you agree to see a psychologist?

622
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,500
Do you know what counseling is?

623
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,580
I looked it up on the internet.

624
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,130
I know the general idea of it.

625
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,170
I understand that

626
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,460
everyone thinks

627
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,980
I am Mu Tingzhou's illness.

628
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,260
Everyone wants to chase me out of

629
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,100
Mu Tingzhou's body.

630
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,380
Eliminating me is the objective

631
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,220
of this doctor.

632
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,740
Grand Tutor,

633
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,420
you won't be eliminated.

634
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:12,100
You will simply regain Mu Tingzhou's memories.

635
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,130
No matter whether you want to eliminate me or

636
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,179
ask me to die instantly,

637
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,260
so long as it's Your Highness' wishes,

638
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,300
I will abide by them

639
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,130
with no complaints and no regrets.

640
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,340
Your Highness.

641
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:53,980
Have some tea.

642
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,700
Grand Tutor.

643
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,980
Today,

644
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,100
we will have a simple chat

645
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,450
to understand each other.

646
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,780
There's no need to be tense.

647
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,180
I understand.

648
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,380
Alright.

649
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,500
Then could you first

650
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,090
talk about yourself？

651
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,500
I am especially interested

652
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,980
in your work.

653
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,300
Doctor Li.

654
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,180
Although you call me Grand Tutor,

655
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,100
I know that in your heart

656
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,620
you still think I'm Mu Tingzhou.

657
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,780
If that's the case,

658
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
why bother

659
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,540
to understand a fictional character?

660
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,050
I will never deny

661
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,980
or try to change

662
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,300
subjective truths experienced by my patients.

663
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,180
I just want to know

664
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,500
why they think that.

665
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,100
Even if everyone

666
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,060
thinks you are Mu Tingzhou

667
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,020
but

668
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,780
you insist that you are the Grand Tutor,

669
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,420
what I'm concerned about is the

670
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,540
reasons behind this.

671
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,460
Doctor Li doesn't beat around the bush.

672
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,460
That's good.

673
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,900
In that case,

674
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,460
let's talk about Mu Tingzhou.

675
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,410
Grand Tutor, why do you want to talk about Mu Tingzhou?

676
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,380
I have always been curious about

677
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,060
why a playactor would forget who he was

678
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,780
due to a show.

679
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,780
In my world,

680
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,020
this is unheard of.

681
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,500
I want to listen to Doctor Li's opinion.

682
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,850
Mu Tingzhou

683
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,540
is a very sensitive actor.

684
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,740
For every role that he acted,

685
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,860
he absolutely believed that

686
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,300
he was the character.

687
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,220
So,

688
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,420
when he successfully creates the character,

689
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,460
he probably also destroys himself.

690
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,380
If so,

691
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,420
is there any method

692
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,700
to get out of character?

693
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,540
Usually

694
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,860
what works best

695
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,060
is to find an

696
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,940
anchor in real life.

697
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,890
Daniel Day-Lewis,

698
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,170
an actor who has received three Oscars,

699
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,850
would return home

700
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,180
and engage in his favorite carpentry

701
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,900
after every role.

702
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,340
That was his anchor.

703
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,580
But Mu Tingzhou

704
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,140
doesn't have an anchor.

705
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,770
Besides acting,

706
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,700
he doesn't have his own life.

707
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,690
That sounds rather admirable.

708
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,380
He must love this profession dearly.

709
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,900
And that is the crux of his illness.

710
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,010
Acting is his whole life.

711
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,460
Besides that, he has nothing.

712
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,630
He gave his life

713
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,260
to this profession.

714
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,140
So, it's very difficult for him to get out of any character.

715
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,220
I only found out today

716
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,300
how much Mr. Mu sacrificed

717
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,610
to act.

718
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,860
I really admire him

719
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,890
but also feel bad for him.

720
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,620
Your Highness, there is no need to feel bad for him.

721
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,540
Everyone chooses their own path.

722
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,220
They ought to persevere on that path.

723
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,620
That is his duty.

724
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,460
It is certainly important to

725
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,340
take our careers seriously.

726
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,820
But

727
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,540
if a person only has is career

728
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,650
and gives up his happiness for that,

729
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,220
isn't it very pitiable?

730
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,940
If Your Highness feels so bad for Mu Tingzhou,

731
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,340
then all the more you should not anticipate his return.

732
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,740
Why?

733
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,980
In my opinion,

734
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,690
Mu Tingzhou is probably tired of his life.

735
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,660
He is tired of experiencing sorrow and happiness

736
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,540
in other people's stories.

737
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,460
He's tired and needs rest,

738
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,250
that's why he has fallen asleep for so long.

739
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,020
Thanks to that, I could wake up in this odd world.

740
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,970
If this is true,

741
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,220
even if Doctor Li really gets him back,

742
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,260
he would be unhappy.

743
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,100
Your Highness.

744
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,460
Please.

745
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,540
Wei.

746
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,420
Speak the truth.

747
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,100
In the beginning,

748
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,420
when you went to take care of the Best Actor,

749
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,860
I thought it was pretty fun to be able to be close to a big star.

750
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,020
But the situation now

751
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,410
is that once the press conference is held tomorrow

752
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,330
you will be famous in the entertainment industry.

753
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,820
Can you deal with that?

754
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
The Best Actor's Princess.

755
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,980
Once you have this identity,

756
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,500
you will be living

757
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,980
in the public eye.

758
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,420
What are you going to do?

759
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,340
Since I have already decided to help Mr. Mu,

760
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,370
I have prepared mentally.

761
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,420
Actually

762
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,260
I'm more worried

763
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,340
that you, mom and dad

764
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,540
will be pulled into this

765
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,940
once I attract media attention.

766
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,500
I'm also worried about mom and dad.

767
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,940
So it's best that you

768
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,260
explain this to them first.

769
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,180
I don't know whether this is right either.

770
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,090
You are my elder sister.

771
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,740
We are a family.

772
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,180
Everything that you do is right,

773
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,060
at least according to me.

774
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,660
Don't give yourself so much pressure, alright?

775
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,660
Let me give you a hug.

776
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,380
Don't worry.

777
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,420
I didn't expect Xiaoya to be so generous.

778
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,700
I just asked around.

779
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,540
One skirt costs thousands.

780
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
Of course.

781
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,100
She's a rich wife now.

782
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,380
If we, her companions,

783
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,380
are dressed shabbily,

784
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,900
it would reflect badly on her.

785
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,180
That's true.

786
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,340
This dress is rather pretty.

787
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,340
That's right.

788
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,210
Come, let's take a picture.

789
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,940
Alright.

790
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:29,780
We haven't taken one in ages.

791
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,930
Come.

792
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,020
Four cute shots as per usual.

Steward Xiao.

795
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,420
Didn't you say that a press conference

796
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,890
is quite an important event?

797
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,010
Why aren't you prepared?

798
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,690
We won't be able to make it.

799
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,100
The press conference is tomorrow, not today.

800
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,100
Why is it tomorrow?

801
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,340
Because the Princess needs to go to Hongyuan Hotel today

802
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,860
to be a bridesmaid for her friend.

803
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,660
Didn't she tell you yesterday?

804
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,580
What is a bridesmaid?

805
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,660
Why does it sound like

806
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,820
a dowry maid?

807
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,460
Aren't you an expert on the internet now?

808
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,780

unsightly.
