2
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,680
Concubine thought

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,239
Let's make her a concubine

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,919
keep her forever

5
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,440
Accompanying Zhanji

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,959
help him well

7
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,080
father emperor

8
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,800
Since you admire her

9
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,279
She should be kept at the Shang Food Bureau

10
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,720
Let her concentrate on cooking for you

11
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,000
Concubine pleads guilty to His Majesty

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,239
His Majesty said before

13
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,919
look at this kid

14
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,520
In fact, she is the emperor

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,479
Taisun concubines set for Zhanji

16
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,679
How can you not be kind?

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,880
It was her

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,559
mother

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,039
you promised me

20
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,479
Your Majesty finally remembered

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
actually

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
It should have been reported to His Majesty earlier

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,199
It's just that this kid is stubborn

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,639
Concubine thinking

25
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,520
let her in the food bureau

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,759
practice more

27
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,839
Who knows what is wrong

28
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,399
almost missed her

29
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,080
His Majesty

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,399
Don't be rude in front of the royal family

31
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,160
I have never been short of people to serve

32
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,479
even if you choose

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,880
I want to choose myself

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,520
not to mention her

35
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,320
i don't like

36
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,639
Junji

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,639
The emperor has always loved you

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,479
whatever the king's will

39
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,960
you didn't disobey

40
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,759
This is the person who the first emperor has slapped his eyes

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
Could it still be wrong?

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,520
Okay

43
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,600
well said

44
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,080
This is a blessing from God

45
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,520
no wonder i see her

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
It feels so familiar

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,639
Since it is a good fate chosen by the first emperor

48
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,880
That

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Choose an auspicious date

50
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,759
Yes

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,160
Father is not allowed

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,639
Too much talking, but my heart is still blocked

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,399
back off

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,279
father emperor

55
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,479
His Majesty

56
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,759
His Majesty

57
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,600
Your dragon body is out of harmony

58
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,919
Concubine even if I go back now

59
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,279
Don't worry too

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,919
you let me go to the hospital

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,520
congrats sister

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,720
you all go down

63
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,600
mother
free at kisskh.me

64
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,880
You clearly promised me

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,279
This matter is no longer mentioned

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,399
Why repeat the old story

67
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,480
do you really dislike her

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,160
like a flower

69
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,480
Are you going to pick it up by hand?

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,160
leave it in the garden

71
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
Isn't free bloom bad?

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
you procrastinate for her

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,519
out of love

74
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,679
But in the royal family

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,679
you and I know

76
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,720
Her name is set early

77
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,119
But sooner or later

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,679
you just saw it with your own eyes

79
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,239
Your father's body is not as good as before

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,559
also worry about you

81
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,959
Do you have the heart to brush his good intentions?

82
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,239
Erchen resigns

83
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,760
He wanted to

84
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,040
No need for him to speak

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,920
Just look at him

86
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,000
there will be someone

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,679
Kneeling and holding it to his feet

88
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,200
All things in this world

89
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,399
Nothing is not

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,239
Don't say it's a flower

91
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,000
even the whole garden

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,079
how can

93
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,519
when did you hear

94
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,399
He said that

95
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
What happened in the palace today

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Messaging to inform Le'anzhou

97
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,679
Yes

98
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,959
you go down first

99
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,160
Yes

100
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,640
what you told me to do

101
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,679
I've done it

102
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,799
Now His Majesty's old illness has relapsed

103
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,320
This is the big sin of the Nine Clan

104
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,440
If Your Majesty is seriously ill

105
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,040
The news of the prince's centrifugation

106
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
Spread to Le'an

107
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,760
you say

108
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,720
Ambitious Han Wang

109
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,079
what will be the move

110
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,959
you're going to rebel

111
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,440
wrong

112
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,679
It was the King of Han who wanted to rebel.

113
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,160
Han king rebels

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
what does it have to do with you

115
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,200
how

116
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,519
Scared

117
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,440
in the Forbidden City

118
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,880
The only person who cared about me

119
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,600
are gone

120
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,519
Even if this subverts

121
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,559
what does it have to do with me

122
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,519
I just don't understand

123
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,040
You are in a high position for your age

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,079
Your Majesty

125
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,320
so trusting

126
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,440
what more do you want

127
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,519
you mean

128
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,679
Eagle dog for a lifetime as an emperor

129
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,040
Live at will?

130
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,279
I'm afraid of him Zhu Zhanji

131
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,320
can't stand

132
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,399
Give

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,519
flour

134
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,359
Yin Ziping

135
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,119
I've only heard

136
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,440
Shangjiao dumplings, Xiajiao noodles

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,280
never heard of

138
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,320
Send your relatives to eat noodles

139
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,039
You are reluctant

140
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,119
little regret

141
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,719
Zijin

142
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,359
my mother used to say

143
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,000
Qin, chess, calligraphy and painting

144
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,280
Women's red cooking is all utensils

145
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,679
Everything in the world can be discarded

146
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,119
What's wrong with that

147
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,239
There is a saying in the Huayan Sutra

148
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,880
All three worlds come and go

149
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,719
Indulge in thoughts

150
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,280
mother once said

151
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,559
Only the beginning of the heart can not give up

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,119
I do not understand

153
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,599
I know you don't understand

154
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,799
Ziping

155
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,880
Xiang Shi once said

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,679
I'm the one who wants to be a grandson

157
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,000
It's providence

158
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,280
Later, they said that Concubine Taisun belonged to someone else

159
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,559
I don't have such a deep blessing

160
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
I do not care

161
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,359
But I don't agree

162
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,239
Even if you are repeatedly tricked by fate

163
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,520
I also wondered if I could fight for my life

164
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,359
not to mention

165
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,320
China's great talents

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,840
I am not alone when it comes to food

167
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,919
The chef's hand needs to turn the pot

168
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,599
I can't do it with my right hand

169
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,280
Then I'll go where I can go

170
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,520
do what only i can do

171
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,440
Are you still thinking about Concubine Zhuang?

172
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,200
don't think about it, don't touch it

173
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,799
That's ancestry

174
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,799
Who says ancestry can't be changed?

175
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,039
you are just one

176
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,599
little prince

177
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,280
Who said my life

178
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,840
Just be a prince

179
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:19,520
you

180
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,119
Ziping

181
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,200
Someone won't let me hide

182
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,200
let me avoid

183
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,679
okay then

184
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,760
I will not hide

185
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,880
Family of exiled rebels

186
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,679
can be released

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,280
this world

188
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,760
What else can't be done

189
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,640
hold it by yourself

190
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,119
Your Highness

191
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,479
Your Highness, rest assured

192
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,520
this wound

193
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,000
Rest for another seven or eight days

194
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,400
it will be great

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,239
Sheng Yin

196
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,799
The emperor's old illness relapses

197
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
menacing

198
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,679
tomorrow

199
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,239
you follow me to the Qianqing Palace

200
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:25,880
see him

201
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,760
This

202
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
back off

203
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:35,599
Yes

204
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,080
Your Highness

205
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,400
It's no use if you go

206
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,000
The emperor hates his ministers

207
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,719
will never let the minister

208
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,000
treated for it

209
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,280
for the previous

210
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,760
You are treating your mother's illness

211
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,359
The emperor will not hold grudges so much

212
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,359
not for this

213
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,239
minister

214
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,479
I got drunk once

215
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,799
joke with colleagues

216
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,119
I don't know how

217
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,760
spread to

218
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,640
It was in the ear of the emperor of the East Palace

219
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,359
The father has always been lenient

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,039
He is rarely angry with his servants

221
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
what did you say

222
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,479
Let the father hate so far

223
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,440
For the doctor

224
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,520
look and hear

225
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,919
lead by inspection

226
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,440
Depends on the patient's external response

227
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,479
know its internal organs

228
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,080
know that you are sick

229
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,760
don't worry

230
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,119
But it doesn't matter

231
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
the emperor
free at kisskh.me

232
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,919
It's not a sign of longevity

233
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,919
you are presumptuous

234
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,719
empress

235
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,520
It's time to stop

236
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,200
go out

237
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,479
go down first

238
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
Your Majesty refuses to see me

239
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:12,840
I do not know

240
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,799
what did i do wrong

241
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,239
you are not always

242
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,719
Are you all good at planning?

243
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,320
Why don't you talk now

244
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,760
empress

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,840
not now

246
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,400
When troubled by grace

247
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,559
real disaster

248
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,159
it's near

249
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,359
you mean

250
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
impossible

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
The emperor flourished in spring and autumn

252
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Fukuzawa is deep

253
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,159
He'll be back to normal soon

254
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,239
empress

255
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,000
Look at His Majesty's look and gait today

256
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,320
How is it better than before

257
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,280
Safe and Dangerous, Good and Bad

258
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,679
how smart you are

259
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Do you still need a slave reminder?

260
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,840
I wish your majesty a speedy recovery

261
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,840
To comfort the concubine's heart

262
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,599
if not

263
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,000
empress

264
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,039
Need to take precautions early

265
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,520
kneel

266
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,599
a prayer

267
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,599
rise

268
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,479
goodbye

269
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
rise

270
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,479
samsara

271
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,119
rise

272
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
four worship

273
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,239
prosper

274
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:14,719
Prince Concubine

275
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,680
It's not etiquette

276
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,359
The prince personally sent his sister back

277
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,920
I just don't want to hurt you

278
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,199
The queen mother is afraid that the people in my palace are clumsy

279
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,400
specially given to these people

280
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,079
to take care of your diet

281
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,400
As for these damask hairpin rings

282
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,280
some of my thoughts

283
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,040
I hope you don't refuse

284
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
Thanks Princess Grace

285
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,599
Since entering the East Palace

286
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,119
is a sister

287
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,719
Don't need so much courtesy

288
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,959
The greeting ceremony is very tired

289
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,560
go back to rest early

290
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:02,959
you

291
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,560
Take good care of the prince

292
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,319
Yes

293
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:06,680
Your Highness

294
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Your Highness

295
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm not deaf

296
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,000
Your Highness

297
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,520
this hour

298
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,319
The prince and concubine are waiting for you in the palace

299
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:43,880
Your Highness

300
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:02,640
Your Highness

301
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,599
What's up

302
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
Your Highness, where are you going?

303
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
The prince is still waiting

304
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:30,760
hurt

305
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,800
lying down too long

306
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,160
I can't use my arms

307
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Do this again and lie down

308
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,280
I'm afraid I can't even open the bow

309
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,880
how come your majesty

310
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,359
This is good wine

311
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,119
You adults drink alone under the moon

312
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
It's a pity that Long Yue doesn't know how to drink

313
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,239
why not

314
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,920
let me be your drinking buddy

315
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,000
Your Highness, you can't drink

316
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,119
are you still hurt

317
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,239
People say shochu is strong

318
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,400
Best to drink less

319
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,400
It is best to drink Shaoxing wine alone

320
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,439
but

321
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,239
Rarely meet like-minded people

322
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,040
I like

323
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,520
Your Highness

324
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
You can't get drunk tonight

325
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,400
My word is Yunzhou

326
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,400
Okay

327
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,479
Unfune

328
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,359
Shangyuan banquet

329
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,479
I see that your martial arts are extraordinary

330
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,439
Chat with me

331
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,199
Your Highness

332
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,319
Wei Chen dare not

333
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,119
Your Highness be careful

334
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:30,800
come again

335
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,640
I have read your memorial

336
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,280
bold

337
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:02,959
Your Highness

338
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,400
Your old wound is broken again

339
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,760
what to do

340
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,079
Weichen Wushu

341
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,280
Your Highness, please forgive me

342
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,599
just learning

343
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,439
sword without eyes

344
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,520
how can i blame you

345
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,239
get up

346
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,439
Your Highness is magnanimous

347
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,719
Thank you so much

348
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,880
But you just said

349
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,160
I say your memorial

350
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,239
I've seen it all

351
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,239
Since taking office

352
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,160
you to the grandfather and the emperor

353
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,719
have done a lot of

354
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,599
whether it is salt administration

355
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,719
water transport

356
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,719
tax law

357
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Coast Defence Military

358
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,079
all involved

359
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,800
And every word is pearly

360
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,319
hit the mark

361
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,359
Unfortunately

362
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,319
these memorials

363
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,439
were thrown aside

364
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,199
No one is looking at it seriously

365
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,839
you see our two patients

366
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
It's not even fun to fight

367
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,640
Until your injury heals

368
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,160
we compare

369
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,479
Yes

370
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,959
adult

371
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,520
you are also injured

372
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,520
are you alright

373
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,719
adult

374
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,319
adult

375
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:55,800
adult

376
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,680
this late

377
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
where else to go

378
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,520
go for a walk

379
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,199
Eunuch Chen

380
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,160
Why is your Highness so late?

381
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
Please inform the prince concubine

382
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,239
Your Highness is practicing sword tonight

383
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,160
Accidentally recurring old injuries

384
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I'm afraid it won't come

385
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,160
Please place the prince and concubine earlier

386
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,800
Prince Concubine

387
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,119
This makes it impossible

388
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,280
don't worry

389
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,199
Your Highness will be back soon

390
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,800
The holy dragon is not in good health

391
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,880
The prince has always been sincere and filial

392
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,040
I'm so anxious

394
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,760
Where is the mood Nafei?

395
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,719
The prince will not come

396
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,040
You go back to rest

397
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,880
I said don't let you play

398
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,560
you are not playing

399
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,280
Imperial Physician Sheng has warned

400
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,239
You can't dance with knives and guns

401
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,359
you also drink

402
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,000
Sheng imperial doctor

403
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,160
are you alright

404
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,359
This is just great

405
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
Gotta rest for a while.

406
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,839
This tour is in trouble.

407
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,880
I tell you Your Highness

408
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,359
he knew

409
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,439
you are seriously injured

410
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,800
He also wrestled with you

411
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,560
Waiting for the queen to return to the palace

412
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,079
I must report to the queen

413
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,239
punish him for a big sin

414
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,719
eventful

415
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,680
Subordinates retire

416
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,079
Your Highness

417
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,239
Otherwise you should rest

418
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,000
get the book

419
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,640
it's so late

420
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:12,040
Your Highness' servants have gone to report

421
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,199
she is angry

422
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,959
no no

423
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,760
what did you say

424
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,400
nor

425
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,920
didn't say a word

426
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,040
Your Highness

427
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:25,160
The ceremony of the crown prince's concubine is cumbersome

428
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,079
Tossed people for days

429
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,319
Good people have lost weight

430
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,719
I've been waiting for you tonight

431
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,079
I'm afraid I can't stand it anymore

432
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,280
This stopped

433
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,000
what do you know

434
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,400
don't talk nonsense

435
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,280
His Royal Highness has not returned

436
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,640
Even if you wait until tomorrow

437
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,839
That's a wait

438
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,760
Your Highness

439
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,599
your madam

440
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:05,920
go down

441
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,959
I thought I'd be cold-hearted by you

442
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,199
did not expect

443
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,160
you didn't even look

444
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,479
Why do you keep looking at me and laughing?

445
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,199
I don't know the prince's concubine

446
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,439
slept well last night

447
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,600
last night

448
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,679
Now the East Palace except the Crown Princess

449
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,159
your highest score

450
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,959
Others should come to meet

451
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,000
The slave has already instructed the Shang Food Bureau

452
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Ready for a small dinner

453
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:27,800
Akin

454
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:31,320
Once upon a time you were Concubine Zhuang

455
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,360
old people around

456
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:36,000
Now the queen asks you to serve me

457
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,560
Don't you feel aggrieved?

458
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,000
Back to the words of the prince's concubine

459
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,080
Back then, my master had nowhere to ask for help.

460
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,800
if you didn't lend a hand

461
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,520
I'm afraid she won't be able to go on the road in peace

462
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,360
This kindness will be remembered forever

463
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:56,879
This time the queen concubine

464
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,159
To send someone to the East Palace

465
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,159
It's a messenger sent by the slaves on their own initiative.

466
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,000
If you have any assignments

467
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,280
Slaves must do their best

468
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,760
it's getting late

469
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,159
Slave, let's get ready

470
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,520
I'm afraid it may not be what you want

471
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,280
nothing you go

472
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes

473
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:52,919
Prince Concubine

474
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,159
it's ready

475
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,239
Akin

476
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:00,679
Yes

477
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,399
go down

478
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,040
Yes

479
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,280
sit here

480
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,479
Being a master is different

481
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,800
Much better than in the Shangshi Bureau

482
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,439
But I'm too rude to sit here

483
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,560
In case His Royal Highness

484
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,479
find out what to do

485
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,080
he never came

486
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:42,639
never been

487
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,679
how come

488
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,879
he didn't come to you

489
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:48,959
you didn't go to him

490
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,560
You haven't reconciled yet

491
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,080
I know

492
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
know what

493
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,959
You blame the queen for forcing you to enter the palace

494
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,280
Even the prince hated it

495
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,239
That's why you promised to marry him

496
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,360
Prepare for a lifetime

497
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,520
come and torture him

498
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,439
right

499
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,199
i can't sit here

500
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,360
For a while, the concubine of the East Palace

501
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,320
come to greet you

502
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,199
I'm so disrespectful to sit here

503
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,120
sit there

504
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,080
Prince Concubine

505
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,479
today

506
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,320
no need to wait

507
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,320
today

508
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,520
you accompany me to dinner

509
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,800
How dare they neglect you so much

510
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
It's so deceiving

511
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,919
The smoked worm you fried today

512
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,919
Oil is too hot

513
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,239
how come

514
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,679
Delicious and crispy

515
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,719
I cooked it myself

516
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:42,919
stop being rude

517
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,439
Yashiki Zen

518
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,199
Yashiki Zen

519
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,199
Puffer Dolphins at Guanglu Temple

520
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,919
you must handle it yourself

521
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,159
Don't fake your hand

522
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,320
queen concubine

523
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,560
I don't like reed bud soup

524
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,800
Use cauliflower soup instead

525
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,800
And sauerkraut

526
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,280
Also prepare more fenugreek

527
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,439
On weekdays, you stay with the little maids

528
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,080
be kind

529
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,760
can't be called

530
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,239
easy to hate

531
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,520
in my absence

532
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,719
Be careful Yuehua

533
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,560
I don't have to worry about you

534
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,159
it's you

535
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
must find a way

536
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,320
Hold the prince

537
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,000
If you want to stay in the East Palace for a long time

538
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,840
The concubines beside Your Highness

539
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,719
Neither one can be ignored

540
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,000
But

541
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:43,679
princess

542
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:44,879
how many of them

543
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:46,360
did not greet the prince's concubine

544
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,159
Miao Xian

545
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:51,199
you haven't gone today

546
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,360
Do you want to meet the prince's concubine?

547
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:53,760
princess

548
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,399
It was to follow the rules

549
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,120
Greetings to the new prince concubine

550
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,840
only

551
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,000
This year's buds

552
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,159
It doesn't look very tender

553
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:02,879
Miao Xian

554
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,000
tomorrow morning

555
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,760
went to ask the prince's concubine

556
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,760
did you hear

557
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,719
princess sister

558
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,479
I didn't mean to be rude

559
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,239
People can't hear it

560
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,560
The smoke on her

561
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,120
what fireworks

562
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,239
Cooking food in the dining room all day long

563
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,399
fishy with lard
free at kisskh.me

564
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,760
Who dares to approach her

565
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,560
Xu is His Royal Highness

566
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
also very dissatisfied

567
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,360
On the day of the canonization

568
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,479
Haven't stayed at all?

569
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
the palm

570
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,959
The prince did not stay at the prince's concubine

571
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,439
It's true

572
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,639
Your Majesty and the Empress

573
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,719
give her grace

574
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,080
I thought something was coming

575
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,000
amazing person

576
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,719
Who would have guessed that just entered the East Palace

577
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,000
into the cold cellar

578
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,760
I saw the slaves just now

579
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,560
To open the cellared peonies for ventilation

580
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,399
I don't know our prince

581
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,239
when can I remember

582
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,439
This prince concubine

583
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:55,840
also call her a breath

584
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:58,360
Don't be sore.

585
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,879
His Royal Highness is a recurrence of an old injury

586
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,199
So it has been

587
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,639
Haven't gone to Xinuan Pavilion

588
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,760
You can't because of this

589
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
rude to the prince

590
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,840
can't go

591
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,159
Disturbing His Royal Highness's recovery

592
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,120
especially you

593
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,199
no fooling around

594
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,600
Otherwise I will never forgive

595
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,239
Yes

596
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,439
I was a while ago

597
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:25,360
made new incense

598
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,760
sleep aid

599
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,399
There's such a thing

600
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,679
Come play with me another day

601
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,199
Who said princes and concubines have no favors?

602
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,479
We should go to the meeting

603
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,560
accepted

604
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,080
accepted

605
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,320
What did you say

606
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,639
What can I say then?

607
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,239
That must be a huge thank you

608
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,639
The maid didn't watch

609
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:10,360
you didn't see

610
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:11,879
That

611
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,479
The prince rewarded the prince's concubine

612
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,199
That is to openly protect her

613
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,800
If the prince concubine knew

614
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,239
Thank you so much for sure

615
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,760
But it was unfortunate when the slaves went

616
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,760
I am afraid that Your Highness will be in a hurry.

617
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,080
So I came back and got back to life.

618
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,120
But if the prince and concubine knew

619
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,399
will definitely come

620
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,399
from Shane

621
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,280
Prince Concubine

622
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,479
you never went out to thank you

623
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:49,639
it's illegal

624
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,080
If His Royal Highness knew

625
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,760
to blame

626
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:53,719
This

627
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:56,719
wait for me to reapply

628
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,399
An hour has passed

629
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:02,879
Let the palace envoys have been waiting outside

630
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,919
Once spread

631
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,080
It's disrespectful too

632
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,439
can only blame

633
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,959
This reward came at a bad time

634
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,280
I didn't come at the right time.

635
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:19,719
His Royal Highness

636
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,280
Ah Jin clothes

637
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:22,199
Yes

638
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,800
go out

639
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:23,879
do not touch

640
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,679
Yes

641
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,199
Akin

642
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,320
Your Highness

643
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:35,919
Please wait in the outer hall

644
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:37,719
I'll be here soon

645
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,040
i have something to ask

646
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,919
I'll leave after asking

647
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,560
what do you want to ask

648
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:45,199
Your Highness

649
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,280
I don't want to ask anything now

650
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,479
I'm staying tonight

651
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,800
you go get ready

652
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,120
Akin

653
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,679
Akin

654
00:43:57,879 --> 00:43:58,360
Akin

655
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,399
Your Highness is not healed

656
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,159
Physicians urged

657
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,399
give you a good rest

658
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:10,199
if
free at kisskh.me

659
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,040
I'm letting His Highness stay overnight

660
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,280
I'm afraid that tomorrow will be the queen's concubine

661
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
called to censure

662
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:17,479
Do not worry

663
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,520
Mother won't blame you
