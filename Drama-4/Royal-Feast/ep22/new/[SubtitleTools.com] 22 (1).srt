1
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,319
Since you left,

2
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,760
My father has always been thinking about it in his heart

3
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,279
After all, they are biological father and daughter

4
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,680
Don't

5
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,160
Can't you really let it go

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Before the mother died of illness

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,080
He told me himself

8
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,559
If I'm not selected

9
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,080
Master Mu doesn't have to die

10
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,879
Mother doesn't have to die with hatred

11
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,559
He said everything, everything

12
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,720
It's all because of me

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
I want to see my mother one last time

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,199
He's the one who put me

15
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,639
He was taken to Pengcheng Bo Mansion

16
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,679
Half a year in confinement

17
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,639
I only hear the wind and rain on a cold night

18
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,960
Have you ever heard of it

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,639
A care from relatives

20
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,360
At that time

21
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,559
Where is Father

22
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,399
Brother

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
And where are you

24
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
Empress T-shirt

25
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,399
That's why I came to see you in the palace

26
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,639
Such grace

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
How rare it is

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,720
A-Mei

29
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,440
You may as well blame us

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,360
Hate us

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,600
You can't just watch

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,479
The whole family of Sun Shi suffers

33
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,679
It's a brother. I

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,639
Please, please

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,199
I'm begging you

36
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,199
You go now

37
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,720
I don't want to see you again

38
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,320
Even though all of us

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm sorry for you

40
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,039
What about the mother who died of illness

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,919
She has cared for you since she was a child

42
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,240
Have you fulfilled her last wish

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,960
You didn't

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,399
If she had a spirit in heaven,

45
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,279
I have to watch helplessly

46
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,320
Look at your husband

47
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,360
And his own son died because of you

48
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,800
You can stand up to her

49
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,679
You are not afraid of the Queen's intimidation

50
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:02,520
Is worried

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,919
Your own splendor and riches

52
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,679
Rest assured

53
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,080
If you really want to decapitate your head,

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,479
Just kill me

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,960
It won't implicate you

56
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,160
An open man

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,760
Purple Azolla

58
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
A-mei who wants a future

59
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,399
Make your own money

60
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:19,880
This

61
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,359
Purple Azolla

62
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:20,600
A-Mei

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Hold one's hopes on nepotism

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,040
Purple Azolla

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Don't fight, you rat who is afraid of death

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,399
A-Mei

67
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,480
You get the hell out of here

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,239
Fuck off

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,519
Fuck off

70
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,959
Zi Jin

71
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Meng Shang Shi

72
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,440
Originally, you chose your own ideas

73
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,720
Participate in Shangyuan Banquet

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
This time her hand was badly damaged

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm afraid it's difficult to heal for a while

76
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,440
Whether or not

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,559
Shang Shi's adult

78
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,160
Aren't you still sick

79
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,200
Shang Shi's adult

80
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,119
Please allow me to participate in the Shangyuan banquet

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,600
As a kitchen

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,279
It is necessary to carve and shake the spoon

83
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,600
Your hand is badly hurt

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,600
In case because of the competition,

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Aggravate the injury

86
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:29,880
Can you do it

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,799
Meng Shangshi chose me as his deputy

88
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,239
If I cherish my own hands blindly,

89
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,040
How to live up to it

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
What about the grace of adults

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,399
I've made up my mind

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,119
Please ask for permission

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,200
Good

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,959
I promise you

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Hu Shang Shi

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
Everyone laughs

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
Hu Shangshi is overreaching

98
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:08,959
Open provocation

99
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,760
I guess

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,399
Over the years

101
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,079
Hu Shangshi has always hidden his strength

102
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,399
Stay until the big day

103
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,279
Show before people

104
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
This is a game

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,399
Hu Shang eats hard

106
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,000
I have been waiting for a competition for ten years

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,600
Prepare to spend half a lifetime of forbearance

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,760
To fight for the glory you want most

109
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,720
But this time

110
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,799
Heaven will be on my side

111
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,079
With this one of you

112
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,160
Probably never again

113
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,399
A hand that can't lift a knife

114
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:44,720
Yes

115
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,399
With this one of mine

116
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,279
You may leave your disabled right hand behind

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,440
I want to see you lose with my own eyes

118
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,480
Lose the most desired power

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,679
Leave the Forbidden City in despair

120
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,559
It deserves to be the person I trained

121
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,079
Good

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,079
I'd like to see it

123
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,679
How do you fulfill this oath

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,679
You're so bored, so bored, so bored

125
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,480
Stop following me

126
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,200
Your Highness just had a nightmare

127
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,959
Think of many old things

128
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,920
There are many things I don't remember

129
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,919
Say what you have to say

130
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,880
Don't hesitate

131
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,599
Your Highness

132
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,760
On the Yuan Festival

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,000
Long live Aoshan Lantern Festival

134
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,039
It is already under preparation

135
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,039
At that time, Your Majesty will invite empresses and princesses

136
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,000
Tongguan Aoshan

137
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,320
Be sure to send more people

138
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,239
Strict interrogation

139
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,840
Yes

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,559
Your Excellency

141
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,880
Everything is ready

142
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,880
If it hurts like this, give up

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,760
Meng Shang Shi

144
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,080
Why do you insist on participating in the competition

145
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,239
I can choose another deputy

146
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Shang Shi's adult

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
I asked Ji Dianyao

148
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,719
If I rest at ease,

149
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,679
When will it recover

150
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,679
She said

151
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,119
Everything depends on God's will

152
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,239
In case

153
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,359
Then this is me

154
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,000
The last chance in life

155
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,880
Hand hurt

156
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,919
Even the most basic kung fu has been forgotten

157
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,119
Beat chicken chopped

158
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,239
Don't cut the knife too hard

159
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,039
Otherwise, the tendon will break in it

160
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,239
Start over

161
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,640
Yes

162
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,159
Since this is your request

163
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,400
I will be strict with you

164
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,599
Regardless of your hands

165
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,039
Will it really be scrapped

166
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,359
We must stick to it

167
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:05,760
Yes

168
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,599
Good

169
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,320
Good

170
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,000
One more

171
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,880
One more

172
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,000
Good

173
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,239
What beautiful fireworks

174
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,479
Good

175
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,119
Good

176
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,239
Your Majesty

177
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:06,880
Good

178
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,640
One more

179
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,239
Okay, one more

180
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,000
Good

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
One more, one more, one more

182
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
One more

183
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,479
Go ahead

184
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,359
One more

185
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,239
Good and wonderful

186
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,400
Take a good look

187
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,599
The lamp is going to burn

188
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,239
Why hasn't His Royal Highness arrived yet

189
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,239
Good

190
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,760
Good

191
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,239
Purple Azolla

192
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,080
Why did you drag me here

193
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,239
It's really too late

194
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,119
There is still an hour left

195
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:02,960
It's about to go to dinner

196
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
What are you panicking about

197
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,679

204
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,280
It's so beautiful

205
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Good and wonderful

206
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,440
Take a good look

207
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,719
It's so beautiful

208
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,440
Purple Azolla

209
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Look at it. Look at it

210
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,159
You

211
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,640
Where are you going?

212
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,640
Son minister see father, emperor and mother

213
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,280
Brother, you are so good

214
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,599
Your Majesty, look

215
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,280
The prince is all for you

216
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,559
I just went off to perform

217
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,960
Just smile

218
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,919
Repeat one's hand

219
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,200
Prince of a country

220
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,919
Act recklessly

221
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,239
What kind of system

222
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,039
My son just wants to

223
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:09,960
Be happy after coaxing your mother

224
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,799
Mother Queen

225
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,119
You have seen it all just now, haven't you

226
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,679
I saw it all

227
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,840
You can have this filial piety

228
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,119
The mother is really overjoyed

229
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,080
Hu Shang Shi

230
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,840
It's up to you to decide the question

231
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,479
Eight Chinese cuisines

232
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,559
But in general terms

233
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,280
There are more than ten million delicacies in various places

234
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,440
We're gonna fight

235
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,880
There is no limit to cuisine and no limit to it

236
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
How about just fighting thoroughly

237
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,679
How to call it a thorough fight

238
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,039
In accordance with previous years' practice

239
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,159
Good cuisine praised by Your Majesty

240
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,559
You can give a banquet to your ministers

241
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
You and I show our magical powers

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,760
Compare final

243
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,640
Delicacies on the list of official banquets

244
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,760
Who is the best chef in the world

245
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,799
It will be clear at a glance

246
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
According to what you said

247
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,799
If you can't support it later,

248
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,320
I have to be substituted

249
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Shang Shi's adult can rest assured

250
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,159
Grass millet

251
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,080
I'll do it

252
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,559
What is Yao Dianshan doing

253
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,719
Serve

254
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,560
Soft chicken skin

255
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,800
The meat is tender

256
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,719
Unusual taste

257
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,199
Back to the emperor's words

258
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
This salt-sealed chicken

259
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,680
It is wrapped in yarn paper

260
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,800
Air-dried chicken

261
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,520
Salt

262
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,760
This is a very interesting way to do it

263
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,599
Your Majesty

264
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,319
This exquisite peony catfish

265
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,520
Not only beautiful in shape

266
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,479
It tastes more beautiful

267
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:36,040
There is also a unique smoky smell

268
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,400
The prince is right

269
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:38,880
Handmaiden specially used

270
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,719
Smoked fish meat with raw tea leaves

271
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,280
It will be slightly fragrant in smoke

272
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,160
Then take this one

273
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
I thought I said I was going to offer nine cold dishes

274
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,479
How can a box be sent away

275
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,760
Is this giving up

276
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,280
Self-knowledge is the most important thing in people

277
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,800
So good

278
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,800
Your Majesty

279
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,040
Handmaiden daring

280
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,439
Please uncover it yourself

281
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,560
You

282
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,199
Don't scare her

283
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,199
I really want to see it

284
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,079
In this box

285
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,599
What a treasure it is filled with

286
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,239
This is

287
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,560
Nine-color box

288
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,880
This box looks quite chic

289
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,280
Available with ordinary boxes

290
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,119
It's just an extra cold dish

291
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,479
I see

292
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,160
There is no previous intention yet

293
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
Back to His Royal Highness the Prince

294
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
The so-called nine-color saving box

295
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,560
Is

296
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,359
White Meat with Garlic

297
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,000
White Jade in Gold Clothes

298
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,800
Chicken slices with pepper and sesame seeds

299
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,800
Carassius auratus with bone crisp

300
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,680
Peach kernel in sauce

301
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,239
Diced rabbit with red oil

302
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,000

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,079
Sweet and sour snow rolls

305
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,599
Nine kinds of ingredients and nine kinds of knife skills

306
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,359
Nine different cooking techniques

307
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,640
The beauty is not in the dish itself

308
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,199
But according to different seasons

309
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,199
Dishes can be adjusted at any time

310
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,000
Meat and vegetable collocation is different

311
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,640
Small saving boxes are all-encompassing

312
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,640
Just follow this nine-color box

313
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,680
Ordered Guanglu Temple to give banquet ministers

314
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,920
Yes

315
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,000
What does the Queen laugh at

316
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,439
Your Majesty

317
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,880
You see how interesting the play is

318
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,719
Which play

319
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,640
Analgesic with acupuncture and moxibustion

320
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,199
It can only seal the pain for a while

321
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,599
If you can't support it,

322
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,040
Never force

323
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Yao Ziliao

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,319
So sharp-edged

325
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,280
It's really rare to see

326
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,839
How

327
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,400
Your hand

328
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,119
Can you still support it

329
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,959
After you lose to me

330
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,119
It will be clear by itself

331
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:47,880
Duck breast has not been colored

332
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:49,760
Add fire

333
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:50,959
Yes

334
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,920
Meng Shang Shi

335
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,040
In no hurry

336
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:24,959
Recipe canon meal

337
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,920
Give me this

338
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,640
It turned out to be cooked slowly

339
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,920
I would like to try it

340
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:49,959
Quiet

341
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,040
Why are you eating today

342
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,160
So serious

343
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,959
Your Majesty congratulates you on the Yuan Festival

344
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,079
Shang Food Bureau carefully prepares meals

345
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
Handmaiden daring

346
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,199
Your Majesty, please taste it

347
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:12,880
Your Majesty

348
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,000
This is the Shang Food Bureau in front of the command

349
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,599
Compare the skills of cooking

350
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,760
This is more interesting than watching a hundred plays

351
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,439
That's true

352
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,400
Please wait a moment, Your Majesty

353
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,119
Roasted duck

354
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,160
This duck is tender and delicious

355
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,599
The skin is crisp and crisp

356
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,680
And this thin layer

357
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,800
Oil on the skin

358
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,160
Duck oil is too greasy

359
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,760
Oil is not fragrant when it is less

360
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,119
Good. The good thing is that it's just right

361
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,359
Incense

362
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,479
It smells beyond words

363
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,319
No

364
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,800
The roasted duck meat in Guanglu Temple is less old and oily

365
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,839
It can't be compared with this

366
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,800
Your Majesty

367
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,959
Original Material Selection of Jinling Roasted Duck

368
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,199
Wild flower duck

369
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,800
Now it is changed to be carefully selected

370
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
Feeding small white ducks

371
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,800
Ingredients are just one of them

372
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,760
Kung fu is the most important thing

373
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,719
The temperature difference is a fraction of a cent

374
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,359
A thousand miles away

375
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,640
Duck's paw is immersed in

376
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,199
The unique aroma of ham

377
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,280
There is also a faint aroma of flowers and fruits

378
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,560
It's honey

379
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,400
Handmaiden with the sweetness of honey

380
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,920
Neutralized salty ham

381
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,280
To highlight the delicious taste of the main ingredient duck's paw

382
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,719
This way of roasting ducks

383
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,079
What pays attention to is skill

384
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,119
And this ladder duck

385
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,479
The test is ingenuity

386
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,119
You can't tell the outcome of this game, can you

387
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,839
Say so

388
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,439
This game is a draw

389
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,839
Chicken is crisp and rotten

390
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,599
This practice is also unique

391
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,359
Your Highness, what's wrong with this dish

392
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,119
Fresh and smooth

393
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,880
Mellow taste

394
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,239
Seemingly tofu pudding

395
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,760
But how can there be tofu pudding

396
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,760
Such a delicious taste

397
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,839
So it seems

398
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,199
You two are still eating again

399
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,760
It's a tie-breaker

400
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,439
This white gourd chicken

401
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,599
It is a combination of wax gourd cups

402
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,640
Practice with watermelon child chicken

403
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,760
It's quite fresh

404
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,599
It's just

405
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,400
This watermelon can be greasy and fresh

406
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,280
Can make chicken soup

407
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,479
Bring a sweet taste

408
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
But this wax gourd is thick

409
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,400
No matter how beautifully carved it is

410
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,040
It can only be reduced to a container

411
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,760
What's the effect on this chicken soup

412
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,280
Your Highness is right

413
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,239
Every ingredient

414
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,599
We should make the best use of everything

415
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
What your highness said is very true

416
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,920
Everything is the negligence of handmaiden

417
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
What is this all about

418
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
What is this thing pasting up

419
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,760
I don't know that either

420
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,520
Recipe canon meal

421
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,680
Hu Shang Shi

422
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,160
Are you putting yellow mud on winter bamboo shoots

423
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,280
You come

424
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:23,880
Good

425
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,199
Concentrate

426
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Don't make a fuss

427
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,119
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

428
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,760
Your Majesty

429
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,719
Once fish and shrimp are dehydrated,

430
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,119
Carry it into the palace chilled

431
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,560
Often lose its true taste

432
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,560
The best kitchen in the world

433
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,040
It can't make up for this regret

434
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:43,680
So do winter bamboo shoots

435
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,239
Dig out winter bamboo shoots in the forest

436
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,880
Baking in place with mud

437
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,239
Is the most beautiful in the world

438
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,119
This bamboo shoot leaves the soil

439
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,199
Not more than half an hour

440
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,920
The handmaiden is wrapped in yellow mud

441
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,040
Cook with slow fire

442
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,560
In order to retain its natural fragrance

443
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,040
Please taste it, Your Majesty

444
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,439
This

445
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
This mountain family gives a clear confession

446
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,120
The recorded forest freshness

447
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,879
It should be eaten locally

448
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,320
Leave the soil for a long time and then put yellow mud on it

449
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,399
And what is the effect

450
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,080
Your Highness, you will know when you taste it

451
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,120
Xianna

452
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,840
Delicious

453
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,679
Please have a look at it

454
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,199
It's salt grains

455
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,080
This lotus root tastes special

456
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:20,439
I can't taste it for a while

457
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,399
The ingredients inside

458
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,840
Taiping Shenghui Fangnei

459
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,800
There was a record

460
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Replenishing Qi and Harmonizing Middle School

461
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,040
Medicated diet for promoting fluid production and moistening lung

462
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,600
It is this Taiping mixed lotus root

463
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,879
It's just lily yam

464
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,000
Asparagus white poria cocos

465
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:36,719
Speaking of it

466
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,080
There is nothing unusual about it

467
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,239
Then this medicated diet

468
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,360
Is it for your majesty

469
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,040
What a pity

470
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,000
Your Majesty must be

471
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,199
Delicacies have been used for a long time

472
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,080
The stomach is bored with panic

473
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,959
Will feel that

474
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,520
Is this spring fresher with winter bamboo shoots

475
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,560
Right, Crown Princess

476
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:25,879
Crown Princess

477
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,320
Should it be all right

478
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,399
I have no idea

479
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,639
Hu Shangshi, they are gone

480
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:18,719
Check

481
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,840
Hu Shang Shi

482
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,919
Is everything ready

483
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,760
Ready

484
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,879
Jade chowder

485
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,959
Be careful

486
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,280
Nothing

487
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,439
Strange

488
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,679
It's about time

489
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,120
Why don't you see Hu Shangshi for a long time

490
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,360
Goose meat is soft and rotten

491
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,080
The soup smells fragrant

492
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,040
Your Majesty always likes to eat geese

493
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,000
The way of roasting goose collected from the folk

494
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,959
No less than a thousand kinds

495
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,600
Can get your majesty's praise

496
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,879
It's not easy

497
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,879
Eat two geese in a row

498
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm afraid I can't taste the delicious taste

499
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:30,959
Come

500
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,360
Unexpectedly better than Yunlin Goose

501
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,639
The taste is fragrant for three points

502
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,800
There are also snow vegetables hidden in the goose belly

503
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,639
Love Princess

504
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:12,040
Queen

505
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,719
Together

506
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:26,600
This goose is as colored as ivory

507
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,080
Soft bone fragrance

508
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
End of product

509
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,879
There are bloodshot bones

510
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,959
The taste is extremely mellow

511
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,760
It's memorable

512
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,040
Right

513
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,080
Hu Shang Shi

514
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,159
How is this goose meal cooked

515
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:45,280
Return

516
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,000
Your Majesty

517
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:48,080
This dish presented by Hu Shangshi

518
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,360
It is the legendary fire-roasted goose

519
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,159
Mother concubine

520
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:58,080
What is a roasted goose

521
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
His Royal Highness King Wei

522
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,120
That is to put geese

523
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,280
Imprisoned in an iron cage

524
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,959
Ignite charcoal fire and bake it

525
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,520
Goose drinks pepper slurry when heated

526
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,040
Shedding of goose feathers

527
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
The goose is still alive

528
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,080
Pepper paste penetration

529
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,320
Goose meat is tender

530
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,080
Cook a goose in this way

531
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,639
Goose meat is extremely tender

532
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,159
Bold

533
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,479
Too cruel

534
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:24,360
Your Majesty, pardon

535
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,320
Hu Shang Shi

536
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,520
Cooking together is taken from nature

537
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,280
How can you cook

538
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,600
Such cruel food

539
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,239
Somebody

540
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,320
Your Majesty

541
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,879
Your Majesty is generous and kind

542
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,320
There was a ban first

543
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:41,479
How dare a handmaiden disobey

544
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,719
It's just

545
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,199
How to make this goose meal

546
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,879
It was carefully developed by handmaiden

547
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,159
I also hope your majesty will be tolerant

548
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,040
Please have a look at it

549
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,560
What is this

550
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,439
Your Majesty, this is coarse shell ash

551
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,919
This goose meal is made of coarse shell ash

552
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,639
Made instead of open flame

553
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,239
Named Roast Goose Without Fire

554
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:47,879
Handmaiden is stupid and ignorant

555
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,000
I misunderstood Hu Shangshi

556
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,040
I also ask your majesty to plead guilty

557
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:55,439
Be jealous of talents and slanderers

558
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,159
Even if the cooking skills are higher,

559
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,879
But there is no room for people in my heart

560
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,239
How do you deserve to be in charge of a game

561
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,439
Your Majesty, today is the Shangyuan Festival

562
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:11,120
Don't let these little things

563
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,399
Bad the festive atmosphere

564
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,840
You guys must feel that you are still eating

565
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,600
Today's party is boring

566
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,959
So I specially set out

567
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,080
Make everyone happy

568
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,360
All right, all right, you guys go down

569
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,760
Prepare meals separately

570
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,040
Yes

571
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,159
Your Majesty

572
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,719
Is Yao Dianshan's hand all right

573
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,919
Yeah

574
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,159
It seems to be seriously injured

575
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,800
You said she was hurt like this

576
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,239
Still insisting on cooking

577
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,000
I can't do it anyway

578
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,439
I can't do this for me

579
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,719
Yeah

580
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,520
I don't know

581
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,800
Will it have an impact on the future

582
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,719
I think this injury is like this

583
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,719
Never rest

584
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,840
It will definitely fall into the root of the disease in the future

585
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,800
I'll take care of the rest

586
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,239
You're sweating in pain

587
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:12,520
I'll do the rest

588
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,719
You go get busy with something else

589
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:15,040
Purple Azolla

590
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,719
Do you know this seasoning recipe

591
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,479
How many times have I peeked at it

592
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:21,560
I've learned it a long time ago

593
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:23,040
You go

594
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,040
To do something else

595
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:27,199
If I get so badly hurt,

596
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,840
I can't even hold a knife

597
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,280
Nothing

598
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,840
Be careful

599
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,040
Zi Jin

600
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,199
This is my possession

601
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,919
It has a miraculous effect on bone and muscle pain

602
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,399
At least it can relieve the pain for a while
