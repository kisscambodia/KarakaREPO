Check the number of cashiers handed over by year

5
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,360
It's a tedious task.

6
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,479
Our department is understaffed

7
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
sudden edict

00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,880
Isn't it a crab in soup

9
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,440
What a mess

10
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,279
Of course

11
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,440
His Highness's order

12
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,080
sir, it must be done

13
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,919
It's just that the end of the year

14
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,759
Please also grant your Highness a grace period

15
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,199
Rong Chen went back to draw up the charter

16
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,199
Report to His Highness again

17
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,440
Your Highness

18
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,440
In fact, this government grain warehouse

19
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,279
There are performances everywhere

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,039
Statistics can be reported

21
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,039
If you really want to send personnel to check on the spot

22
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,440
It's just the selection of this person

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,039
need to reconsider

24
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,880
scrutiny after scrutiny

25
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,080
Be cautious

26
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,440
Yichen's opinion

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
Why don't you put it on hold

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Think long term

29
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,679
Master Song is right.

30
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,039
It's a pity that I saw your majesty yesterday

31
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,000
He said eight months is too long

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
Only for half a year

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,399
So

34
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,039
Lord Song

35
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,520
tired

36
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:53,919
adult

37
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,360
Please

38
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,119
resign

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,839
What laughing

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Is the book organized?

41
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,079
Your Highness

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,239
Your Highness

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
The maid has doubts

44
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,679
dare to ask

45
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,679
Your Highness, what is this painting?

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,799
This is the fruit of the tribute from Sumatra

47
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,119
it's called gambler

48
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,239
Grandpa didn't like the smell of it

49
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,720
but i tried it once

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,640
taste very sweet

51
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,119
Dare to ask your highness

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,239
Where are the overseas countries

53
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,239
What kind of customs?

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,079
This is the homework of the Food Bureau

55
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,679
To make a menu for overseas envoys

56
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,000
listen to you

57
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,839
Seems like I can't wait to find a boat

58
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,959
fled overseas

59
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,279
There is no shortage of strange people in all dynasties

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,239
Passionate about finding immortals overseas

61
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,359
Xian did not find

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,079
But there are a few logbooks

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,959
if you are interested

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,119
find yourself

65
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,359
Maybe on the side of the travelogue

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,399
Your Highness

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
Concubine Taisun has invited someone again

68
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:55,920
Your Highness

69
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,239
take it

70
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,559
Your Highness won't be here tonight

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,959
Yes

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,920
Yuan Gonggong

73
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,359
Grand Concubine

74
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,519
Your Highness is afraid that you will be empty

75
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,679
The special servants came to report

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
so

77
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,079
he's not coming

78
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,119
The emperor has recently detained his master to discuss political affairs

79
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,040
So His Highness he is too busy

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
After Your Highness is free

81
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,160
The first to think of you

82
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,399
Go ahead

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,839
Grand Concubine

84
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,799
Brocade book

85
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,279
It's my fault

86
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,839
I broke his heart

87
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
walk with me

88
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,640
if someone disappoints you

89
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,040
She wants to regret now

90
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
will you forgive her

91
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,760
why not answer

92
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Your Highness

93
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,320
no one

94
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,200
can be changed

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,279
goodness is great

96
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,519
You are really weird

97
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
You have done so much

98
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,760
see me but say nothing

99
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
You know I'm talking about her

100
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,559
But let me go see her

101
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,079
I let you go

102
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
because you want to go

103
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,839
His Highness is in doubt

104
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,320
can not be released for a long time

105
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,760
How can this be happy

106
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,640
It's better to be open and honest and ask for peace of mind

107
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,200
isn't it?

108
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,519
in the royal

109
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,359
Don't ask for a life-and-death love

110
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,200
But ask for a wife who is respectful

111
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,200
But I sat with her

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,919
both feel uncomfortable

113
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,719
you say this world

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,960
Is there such a strange couple?

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,359
Your heart is so sincere

116
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,400
Who in the world will not cherish

117
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,039
As long as your Highness treats you with sincerity

118
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,400
There will be a day when the clouds will see the sun

119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,840
i go see her

120
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,400
you are really happy

121
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,200
As King's Worry

122
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,440
worry about oneself

123
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,400
Your Highness Showing Your Face

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
We are Xinyue

125
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,799
His Highness is in doubt

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
can not be released for a long time

127
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,960
How can this be happy

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,760
It's better to be open and honest and ask for peace of mind

129
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,239
Let's go to Hongqing Palace

130
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,320
Yes

131
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,119
The people's daughter greets Her Royal Highness the Crown Prince

132
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,200
Your Highness

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,359
Concubine Taisun greets Princess Concubine

134
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,479
will be back soon

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,719
Your Highness, please take a seat

136
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,479
This is Miss Hu Fuqi

137
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,119
Entering the palace to visit the concubine Taisun

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,719
Your Highness is back

139
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,840
why didn't you tell me sooner

140
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,880
you are talking to the princess

141
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,119
How dare a slave to disturb

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,599
Seven Sisters

143
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
How did you come

144
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,640
Shanyuan greets the concubine Taisun

145
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,159
No one reported it before

146
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,119
what happened

147
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,799
why not answer

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,280
The previous crown princess gave her mother

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,599
The favor of visiting the palace

150
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,799
Now the concubine is ill

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,119
mother often misses

152
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,039
But the legs are not flexible

153
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,239
So he sent the seventh sister into the palace to visit the sick.

154
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
I am sick

155
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,599
what's wrong with me

156
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
The concubine and the grandson have been married for a long time

157
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,320
but no offspring

158
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,039
Not only the princess misses

159
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,799
Parents are often worried

160
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,200
elder sister

161
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,919
I have always thought of family

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
No matter how much I blame you or hate you

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,159
I also regard you as the only support in the palace

164
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,479
You are the only person I can trust

165
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,799
But only because I have no children

166
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,280
Can't win more honor for the Hu family

167
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,919
you

168
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,599
you one by one

169
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,679
Why are you so cruel to me

170
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,200
why

171
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,679
speak

172
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,080
Sanjie

173
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,880
No wonder His Highness just came

174
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,919
Left without looking back

175
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,679
He thought I was a wife

176
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,799
for my own selfish desires

177
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
to dedicate my sister to my husband

178
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,919
So flattering for my mother-in-law

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,679
OK

180
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,320
Since you don't care about your face

181
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,039
Then I will complete you

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,880
come

183
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,799
drag this bitch down

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
Thirty

185
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,039
banished from the palace

186
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Grand Concubine

187
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,799
This

188
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,919
master

189
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,799
Grand Concubine

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
please forgive the slave

191
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,200
master

192
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:41,760
master

193
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,159
The eldest lady saves the slave

194
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,239
The slaves also obey your orders

195
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,280
Slaves are obeying orders

196
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,400
Master Jinshu has followed you since childhood

197
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,559
But the closest maid by your side

198
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,799
Such a one for the Hu family

199
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,039
The servant girl who can betray and deceive her master at any time

200
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,919
I will never keep her
Free at kisskh.me


201
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,599
you take her out of the palace immediately

202
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,840
from today

203
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
without my orders

204
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,760
No one from the Hu family is allowed to enter the palace again.

205
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,599
you listen

206
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,400
from today

207
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,479
I want to live by my own will

208
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
either you

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,159
still father

210
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,039
If you go against my will

211
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't blame me for being ruthless

212
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
elder sister

213
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,280
Sanjie

214
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Why does the third sister seem like a different person?

215
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,599
It's better to change

216
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
If she was still

217
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,159
hazy look

218
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,640
I can't live in this palace

219
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,119
now so

220
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,440
She looks like a grandson

221
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,239
let's go

222
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,280
I will send you out of the palace

223
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,239
Your Highness

224
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,559
Your Highness

225
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,840
Your Highness

226
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
Concubine Taisun is still waiting outside

227
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,880
There is no need to report her news in the future.

228
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,400
Yes, I understand

229
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,479
wait

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,719
The slaves are going to invite the concubine Taisun now.

231
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,559
Your Highness

232
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,320
I am past

233
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,559
tell her

234
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,919
the book is messed up

235
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,479
call her to rearrange

236
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,000
Your Highness

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,880
I know

238
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,880
you go to report again

239
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,119
I have an urgent matter to meet with Your Highness

240
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,159
Grand Concubine

241
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,440
You know the temper of Your Highness

242
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,960
The more you clamor to see him

243
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,239
The more angry he is

244
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,320
otherwise

245
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,400
you go back first

246
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,520
Wait until the day when His Highness will be relieved

247
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
Are you here to make amends?

248
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,400
This is over

249
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,440
master

250
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,479
It's windy here

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,159
let's go back

252
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,719
I can't find a book I'm looking for

253
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,799
how did you organize

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm asking you

255
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,200
Your Highness

256
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,760
asking me

257
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,640
Still asking a slave

258
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,719
What's the difference

259
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,559
His Highness said

260
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,799
I am a slave

261
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,640
What did you say

262
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,440
I persuaded the Highness to go down to see the Taisun Concubine

263
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,359
Your Highness vented his anger on me

264
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,239
I think Your Highness should know

265
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,159
everything i do for you

266
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,599
Not a slave would do it for a master

267
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,520
you

268
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,919
i love you

269
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
what i did for you

270
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,840
A woman does it for a man she admires

271
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,960
To make His Highness happy

272
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,319
I can endure the loss

273
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,599
even heartache

274
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,359
persuade you to see the concubine Taisun

275
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,800
but you

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
But the books I organized

277
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,079
Just give up like this

278
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,439
Your Highness did not lose a book

279
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,680
but my heart

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,439
you

281
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,959
How dare you talk to me like this

282
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,319
Your Highness

283
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:29,239
You treat me the way a master treats a slave

284
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
from now on

285
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,839
I will also use

286
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,239
Treat you the way a slave treats a master

287
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,920
It wasn't my job to organize the study

288
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,719
It is only natural that His Highness is dissatisfied

289
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,920
But the punishment is

290
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,439
Your Highness, if you have no other orders

291
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,520
The maid quit

292
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,719
what did she just say

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,319
she

294
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,640
she said she likes you

295
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,520
She said she was going to be a slave

296
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,880
to treat her master

297
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
get her back

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,280
go

299
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,880
roll roll roll

300
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,599
roll roll roll

301
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,959
Your Highness asks you to come back

302
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,760
let you go back

303
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,599
you are finished

304
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,400
Your Highness

305
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,199
It is better to use Tibetan pig or mullet roe

306
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,280
no no no

307
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,359
Someone also used

308
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,640
What else can I use?

309
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,760
I have my own way

310
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:41,359
real

311
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,359
Go ahead

312
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,160
You get busy

313
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,680
hurry hurry hurry

314
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,719
go

315
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,000
look

316
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,359
how is she cutting cucumbers

317
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not giving up

318
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,359
come yet

319
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm coming

320
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,520
Grandson, please take a seat

321
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,119
Father

322
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,479
I heard you are sick

323
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,760
Have you ever called a doctor?

324
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,040
What is the disease

325
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,160
Headache

326
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:13,680
no

327
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,839
is here

328
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,800
cut out the heart

329
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,040
messed up

330
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,119
At once

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,800
both hurt

332
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,599
Father is sick

333
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,079
should be healed in peace

334
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,520
any mission

335
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,920
Although I told my son

336
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:41,760
really

337
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,439
really
Free at kisskh.me


338
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:45,680
Okay

339
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,560
You adult

340
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,640
don't have to be so serious

341
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,400
Today I'm not here to look for the ballast

342
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,959
Lord Liu enters the palace for an audience

343
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,119
I'm here to see the menu for the embassy

344
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,479
I'm just leading the way

345
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:10,599
Meng Shang food

346
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,119
Last year's meal list at Guanglu Temple was due to the different tastes

347
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,079
almost cause trouble

348
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,800
This year's Prince's decree

349
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,719
to supervise

350
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,319
Not a little sloppy

351
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,319
Mr. You has had a lot of dealings with those Fan people.

352
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,959
That's why I asked him to take a look

353
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,280
two adults

354
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,479
please come with me

355
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,119
succulent

356
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,439
but not greasy

357
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,160
Completely different from the usual pork

358
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,959
Tibetan fragrant pig sent by Wusi Zangdusi

359
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,839
what the adults say is good

360
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,719
This pig grows in the forest

361
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,199
drink natural spring

362
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,239
It is eaten by wild people participating in pine mushrooms

363
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,520
So the meat is delicate and mellow

364
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,359
fresh and tender

365
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,040
slaves want

366
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,560
Most of the guests come from the sea

367
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,160
I have never tasted the delicacy of Tibet

368
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,719
This is how to make soup with the backbone of Tibetan pig

369
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
The front legs are made of a lion's head

370
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,599
such pork

371
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,479
No matter how it is cooked

372
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,239
will not disappoint

373
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,280
well said

374
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,119
I am the only one in the world

375
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,119
Where to find this ginseng pig

376
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,359
It's so delicious

377
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,239
good

378
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,800
Garnish with ginger and cinnamon

379
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
unripe fragrant nose

380
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,839
Pufferfish are poisonous

381
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,119
Jiang perch is ashamed

382
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,439
Saury is indeed the first of Jiang Xian

383
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,280
But now the spring flood has not come

384
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,880
I even used dried fish to pass it off

385
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,719
Also used gold foil

386
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,359
It's ordinary color

387
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,280
Wrapped in arabesque satin

388
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,280
She's an absolute beauty

389
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,439
self-deception

390
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,160
back off

391
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:26,119
back off

392
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Why do you add pepper to it?

393
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:43,640
in my hometown

394
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,800
Pepper all the way from Sumatra

395
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,839
Shipped from Guri

396
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,000
The price is more precious than gold

397
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,400
adult

398
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,680
This is the tribute girl who just arrived

399
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,359
my country's Kunei pepper piles up like a mountain

400
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,680
you save others

401
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,000
Treat such a cheap thing as a treasure

402
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,239
Wouldn't it be rude

403
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,640
The slaves have little knowledge

404
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,800
please forgive me

405
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,239
What's the disrespect

406
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Unknown His Royal Highness arrives

407
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,479
Please forgive me if I miss you

408
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,359
It's a small disqualification for entertaining guests

409
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,280
It is a great thing to lose the national body and talent

410
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,359
I heard everything you just said

411
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,680
under the sky

412
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,439
Could it be the king's land

413
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,400
The Shore of the Land

414
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,079
Could it be that the prince

415
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,079
I am China since the Qin and Han Dynasties

416
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,959
Then there is no end to the source of foreign

417
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,959
As for me even more so

418
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,119
Grandpa the Emperor

419
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,119
where is the caravan

420
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,280
Whether by sea or land

421
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:46,199
Can't bully the widow, can't bully the weak

422
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,319
Some places don't know the time

423
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,680
give the calendar

424
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:50,959
church farming

425
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,719
In some places, banana leaves are used as food.

426
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,800
People can only eat cold food

427
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,000
to open a ceramic market

428
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,160
Administer acupuncture herbs

429
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,959
It's unethical in some places

430
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Killing

431
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,680
We're going to put an end to the war

432
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,520
brought by our fleet

433
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,760
More than just gorgeous silk and china

434
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,280
Chinese herbal medicine

435
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,719
Acupuncture weaving

436
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,880
Architectural Navigation

437
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,839
and a large number of Chinese classics

438
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,800
stay in overseas countries

439
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,439
why we do this

440
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,319
only because of widowhood

441
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,199
followed by chaos

442
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,599
Only the world is peaceful

443
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
Then the people of the world can enjoy happiness

444
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,239
so

445
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,880
She doesn't understand what you're going to tell her

446
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,560
and treat them equally

447
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,599
Your Highness, please forgive me

448
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,839
These children are confined to the deep palace with limited vision

449
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,839
The lessons of His Highness are better than my ten years of work

450
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,199
Remember today's words

451
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,079
One must have a broad mind and vision

452
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,560
good for your life

453
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:51,920
Yes

454
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:37,760
back off

455
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,079
A Red Shrimp is mentioned in the Supplements of Materia Medica in the Tang Dynasty

456
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,079
Born in Linhai Kuaiji

457
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
The big one is one foot long

458
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,520
must be a hairpin

459
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,880
Just in time with Taiping County Chronicle

460
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,400
The colorful giant shrimp with burly and unusual

461
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,319
same

462
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,359
Therefore, it is also called the god shrimp in Quanzhou Prefecture.

463
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,719
Today, the traditional practice of local fishermen is specially used

464
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,359
Cook Splendid Shrimp Rice

465
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
Please taste

466
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,400
where is the meal

467
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,439
Your Highness does not know

468
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,079
fishermen's food

469
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,800
often refers to fish

470
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:51,239
Shrimp dipped in sauce with unique flavor

471
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:54,719
Makes people feel like they are back in the bow

472
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,760
The moment the sea breeze blows

473
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,079
indescribably delightful

474
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,239
Fragrant and chewy

475
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,880
the smell of the sea

476
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,119
Your Highness, what do you say?

477
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,719
Flour glutinous sweet and endless aftertaste

478
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:26,040
Needless to say, betel nut and taro

479
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,119
Taro again

480
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,319
Crunchy and sweet

481
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
Far better than steamed taro

482
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,680
One taro and two

483
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,199
common food

484
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,920
make an unusual taste

485
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,839
That's the craft

486
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,800
no matter how delicious

487
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,760
Just some sliced ​​cucumbers

488
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,040
Fennel Broad Beans

489
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,280
add taro

490
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,719
Not even a piece of meat

491
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,199
Why be so stingy

492
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,199
Are you going to win by quantity?

493
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,520
Grandpa Huang asked his father to do errands

494
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,719
Father fell ill

495
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,199
But the emperor's order is the emperor's order

496
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,040
he is sick

497
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm the only one here

498
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:28,719
Your Highness

499
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,439
Do you still need to ask the prince for the meal list?

500
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,280
call the cook

501
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,359
Why use ordinary food

502
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,800
Back to His Highness

503
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:55,880
ancients cloud

504
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,479
Have friends come from afar

505
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,040
entertain guests

506
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:02,199
should make them feel at home

507
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,439
But the people of our country are the most precious people

508
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,439
All the products of this land

509
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,719
It is a gift from God to the hard-working people

510
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,080
They are the ones who should taste the most

511
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,520
and

512
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,679
Zhang Qian was on a mission to the Western Regions

513
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,959
Bring back the ingredients you used today

514
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,560
precious seeds

515
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,280
Rooted and sprouted in my Chinese land

516
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,120
cultivated from generation to generation

517
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:28,719
In order to change the ever-changing taste

518
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,800
vote me with peach

519
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,639
Report it to Qiong Yao

520
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Prepare meals for the envoys

521
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
In addition to mountain delicacies

522
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,879
Add these too

523
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:51,879
the rice I just ate

524
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,879
It's very soft and delicious.

525
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Jingshan Bridge Rice

526
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,959
Huguang suffered a natural disaster last year

527
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,199
If this rice is supplied to the embassy

528
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,199
Then the wealthy businessmen in Beijing

529
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,679
will compete

530
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,040
so that

531
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,239
People's life will be much better

532
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,879
Just a little chef

533
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,919
How to have so much mind

534
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,639
But it's just a coincidence

535
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,040
Why is he back

00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,320

you haven't been looking for

547
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:57,000
Is this logbook?

548
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,399
I sent it to you

549
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,080
no use

550
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,800
Take it all

551
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,520
take it

552
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,280
On behalf of the slaves and maids, thank the imperial grandson for the reward

brought back by our fleet

557
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,639
will be more than jewelry and spices

558
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,239
There will be more products that benefit the Chinese people

559
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,159
completion

560
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,719
Forgot the most important sentence

561
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,040

that's what she said

564
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,360
How dare that servant dare to talk nonsense?

565
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,439
That's what Yao girl said

566
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,439

00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,360
Back to His Highness

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,120
Slaves are guilty, please punish Your Highness

583
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,760
what are you guilty of

584
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,280
The slaves are stupid, please express your highness

585
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,760
get out

586
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,360
The slaves retire

587
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,760
you go get her back

588
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,560
If you can't persuade you to come back, don't come back

589
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:51,080
Your Highness

590
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,520
Why is this called persuasion to come back?

591
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,280
I can't stand her yin and yang look

592
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,439
Your Highness

593
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,080
Yao girl is not yin and yang strange

594
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,159
This is how slaves serve their masters

595
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:01,959
Q&A

596
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,840
cautiously

597
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,080
no arrogance

598
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,679
What's wrong

599
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,280
what's wrong

600
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,360
I never treated her as a slave

601
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,000
go quickly

602
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,520
go

603
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,919
Your Highness

604
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,199
you see

605
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:30,479
is the month

606
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,560
Her Royal Highness takes tonic

607
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,879
Hot things that cannot be baited

608
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,679
Eat early

609
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,040
Into barley lotus seed duck soup

610
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,600
Substitute hibiscus meat with chub tofu

611
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,639
Apricot Blossom Goose Mixed Gorse

612
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:46,879
cut roe

613
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,439
go get her back

614
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,199
this time

615
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:25,840
go for me

616
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,760
Yes

617
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,120
Pinellia

618
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:53,000
three spoons

619
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,000
Gold Fang San

620
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:23,879
Zijin

621
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:25,439
look at my craft

622
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,080
do you look good

623
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,399
it's too expensive

624
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,639
The pattern is too dense

625
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,760
But still much better

626
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:39,600
make persistent efforts

627
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,120
Meng Shang food

628
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:01,239
Mr. Chen

629
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,520
Meng Shang food is polite

630
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:04,639
sir

631
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,399
ashamed

632
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:09,320
I vaguely remember when Hanying entered the palace for training

633
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,000
you have taught

634
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
It's right to call you Mr.

635
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,879
I didn't know you were visiting today

636
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,959
But what did the grandson command?

637
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,479
Lord Yang entered the palace today

638
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,280
Occasionally taste Miss Yao's Suzhou pastry

639
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
quite elegant

640
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,360
I want to call the kitchen cook in the house to copy it

641
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,959
I came here specially to ask for a recipe.

642
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:27,560
this little thing

643
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,560
I asked Zijin to write it out and send it over

644
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:31,399
He Lao, come to the door yourself

645
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:38,159
Then thank you Meng Shang for eating

646
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,120
I'll send someone to pick it up later

647
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,399
Okay

648
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,199
Mr. Chen walk slowly

649
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,840
Lord Shang Shi please forgive me

650
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,040
I'm also afraid of missing Zijin's good future

651
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
servant of israel

652
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,639
what a good future

653
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,879
Young and ignorant is a good thing

654
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,800
save a lot of worries

655
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,080
There are rules in the palace

656
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,600
Female officials have the dignity of female officials

657
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,679
People are in my food bureau all day

658
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,040
Take my shelter for a day

659
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,639
There is no reason to forcibly take it away

660
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:20,280
Don't do this stupid thing next time

661
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:21,479
I will not forgive

662
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,120
Yes

663
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,679
doesn't taste right

664
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:43,000
Your Highness

665
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,520
today's dish

666
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,000
Same as yesterday

667
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,120
what's wrong

668
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,760
try it yourself

669
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,159
How dare a slave

670
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:06,320
can't taste

671
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,080
Your Highness please express

672
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,199
Not the food is wrong

673
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,919
Your Highness is in a bad mood

674
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:15,919
Your Highness

675
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,320
same food

676
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,919
Diners have different moods

677
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,120
taste will be different

678
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:22,800
I think it's because the cooks don't care
