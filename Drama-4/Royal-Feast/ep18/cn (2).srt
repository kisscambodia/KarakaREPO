1
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,040
Why is Yao Zijin

2
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,800
Su Yuehua

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,760
You can't afford to lose and deliberately provoke you, right?

4
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
Ziping, tell me why you won

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
say something

6
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,319
People are willing to gamble

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,919
Ziping

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,440
Ziping

9
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,800
you don't talk

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,559
At that time, the empress was clearly

11
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,880
There must be a problem with this

12
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,080
You tell me

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,039
what did you do

14
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,839
Wang Mojie loves to visit Zen and worship Buddha

15
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
Can the real Wangchuan Tuli

16
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,679
There are boat tourists

17
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,440
only no monks

18
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,559
monk
Free at kisskh.me

19
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,399
The old monk under the tree

20
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,279
Emperor Taizu once entered Huangjue Temple as a monk

21
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,399
The most hated people in my life

22
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,440
Put bald and monk in your mouth

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,839
Who in the Forbidden City dares to speak only a few words?

24
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
The consequences could be disastrous

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,759
But now times have changed

26
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,279
Few people in the palace remember this taboo

27
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,240
But the queen is well aware

28
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,479
how can you win

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,039
Turns out you were deliberately misleading me

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,399
Su Yuehua

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,639
People catching mice in their own home

32
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,600
The person who made you put on good looks is not right

33
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,119
One has to get in.

34
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,320
Ziping

35
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,880
It's just a little trick

36
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,679
today's test

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,639
I'm the

38
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,360
i won

39
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,600
Yuehua

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,839
The most difficult part of the real Wangchuan map do you think

41
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,759
Is it really about recreating the mood in the painting?

42
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,039
Is not it

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,919
Wangchuan map sample

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,720
Truly the most exquisite fancy cold cuts in the world

45
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,440
It's a pity for the cold season

46
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,639
blown by cold wind

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,679
All ingredients will become colder and harder

48
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,360
The function of viewing is far greater than eating

49
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,440
I already thought about it

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,679
Using the method of carving candied fruit in Jingzhou, Huguang

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,880
Preserve all the ingredients in advance

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,160
for the nobles to taste

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,759
Pity

54
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,040
The painting was stolen by you

55
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
anything i can think of

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,279
you would not have imagined in advance

57
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,799
because you put all your thoughts

58
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,519
It's all about showing off

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
But forget that the ingredients are ultimately imported

60
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,200
The picture of Wangchuan is very beautifully restored

61
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,880
If you use this talent for sidetracking

62
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,519
Then you are on the way of cooking

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,920
really stop there

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,640
Walk Zijin

65
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,720
ignore her

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,959
can't see

67
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,559
awesome

68
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,079
You adult

69
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,640
What I draw you can believe

70
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,279
You can't be so naive

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,519
let's go

72
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,480
Really annoying

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,559
can't afford to lose

74
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,119
All right

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,519
The person sent to fetch the painting did not take a close look at the painting

76
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,519
I made her a trap

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
But it's interesting that you come to me

78
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Just lost once

79
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,119
Why do you look so ugly

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,959
She's never been so serious

81
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
In the end what happened

82
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,519
The high-rise buildings in the city are cut too clear

83
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,600
It's sunny in the evening

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
West Mountain Green and East China Sea

85
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
Nanji Boat Club Beijing

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,920
The red brocade garden is suitable for sunset

87
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,279
Huang Yunlongmu sees Qiucheng

88
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,279
The sky is deserted

89
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,959
Watching the Flying Hundred Miles

90
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
how

91
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,440
good poem good poem

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,040
Your Highness

93
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,559
Upstairs last night

94
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,799
Is there a beauty on the boat

95
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,079
what look

96
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,760
Where does the beauty come from in the dead of night

97
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,679
There's almost a female ghost

98
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
This looks more and more like a person

99
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,239
full of nonsense

100
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,920
But where does the letter pen look like?

101
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,239
Is it like

102
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,399
slave maid dazzling

103
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
wrong, wrong

104
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,920
Slave, damn it, slave, damn it

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,799
slaves be damned

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Your Highness

107
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Hu Shangshi was my accident

108
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,000
please forgive

109
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,799
A message from Kunning Palace just now

110
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,840
from now on

111
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,039
You are no longer the classic meal of the Shangshi Bureau

112
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,520
Hu Shangshi

113
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,760
Please allow me to have a second chance to test

114
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
You already lost the first game

115
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
How dare you speak out

116
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,960
not going out

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,200
If you lose the second game

118
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,559
how should

119
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,799
just me

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Can beat Yao Zijin

121
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
What an amazing person she is

122
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
not worth mentioning at all

123
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,640
replace me

124
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,760
I can give you one last chance

125
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,640
But this time if you lose again

126
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,239
leave the food court forever

127
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,039
Yes

128
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,520
That Su Dianshan's knife skills

129
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
It's a bit eccentric

130
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
look

131
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Nashan Nashui

132
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,559
It's a bit like the original painting

133
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,679
Descendants of the famous chef Su

134
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
nature is extraordinary

135
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,200
such a pity

136
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,960
The Queen is intentionally helping Hu Shanwei

137
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,960
Nature does not judge fairly

138
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,960
The old monk who practiced Zen

139
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,080
Can predict the queen's mind so accurately

140
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,039
You are still crouching tiger, hidden dragon in the food bureau

141
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
The tricks of young people can't be hidden from the eyes of the empress

142
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,000
Wang Mojie's picture of Wangchuan and the old monk who participated in Zen

143
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,080
It also complements each other

144
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,280
It's just the second game.

145
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,200
It's not something that the concubines of the harem can decide.

146
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,159
concubine empress means

147
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
On behalf of the emperor, the East Palace will invite important ministers in the DPRK

148
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,559
Swimming Taiye Pool

149
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
What about the second game?

150
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
Set in Xiyuan

151
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:11,919
Your Highness

152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,559
Freshly delivered Jin Yu Soup

153
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,400
I know you don't like too sweet

154
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,640
Specially told them to put a little honey

155
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,559
Just seasoned with osmanthus

156
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,320
you try

157
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,440
Your Highness

158
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,960
Recently, I am either writing or drawing

159
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,760
Don't have to deal with government affairs?

160
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
I rarely have time to spend more time with you

161
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,719
Is it not good

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,200
When the former emperor was

163
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,000
Not taking you on a northern tour

164
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,760
It is to force you to assist in government affairs

165
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
The memorial can never be read

166
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,280
I can't even see you

167
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,039
Now His Highness is free

168
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,239
I am happy

169
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,359
It's just that the father emperor has not been on the throne for a long time

170
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,280
Many government affairs

171
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,719
His Royal Highness as the Crown Prince

172
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,039
should share more for him

173
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Then he must be willing to let me help him share the burden.

174
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,239
Your Highness should be cold

175
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm tired

176
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,440
princess

177
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,640
His Royal Highness he

178
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,919
It seems that all the past

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,640
Your Highness has never forgotten

180
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,119
temple

181
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,599
No risk of burning felt

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
Simmer what Lei Gong Li

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
open, open, open

184
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,239
Come with joy today

185
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,039
You must be happy

186
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,000
Your Highness, look

187
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,159
Your Highness

188
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,040
Your Highness

189
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,359
the emperor is here

190
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,079
big brother

191
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Isn't His Highness the Emperor ill?

192
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,280
Holy car is coming

193
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,560
Notify the dining room

194
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,319
meal preparation

195
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,239
Yes

196
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,719
father emperor

197
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,520
see your majesty

198
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,280
no

199
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,119
thank you your majesty

200
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Hurry up

201
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,640
quick

202
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,479
put this over there

203
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
come over here

204
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,760
tap tap

205
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,040
don't disturb the holy drive

206
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:13,880
Zhao Gonggong

207
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,880
The nobles have no good ears

208
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,000
How can you hear it from so far away?

209
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,839
Your kid has a long life, right?

210
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,280
what to do

211
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,800
Zhao Gonggong

212
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,599
Just let them do these little things

213
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
He Lao, you ordered it yourself

214
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,599
Your Majesty came to Xiyuan last time

215
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,319
eat something cold

216
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
cold wind blows again

217
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,160
As a result, I went back and fell ill.

218
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,160
So this time the queen and the lord let me come

219
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,439
just to tell you

220
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,119
These wild birds

221
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,680
must be extra careful

222
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,599
Please rest assured, Eunuch Zhao, I will wait to understand

223
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,920
Those two are busy first.

224
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,400
is a good sword

225
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,880
Your Majesty listened to you

226
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,199
The first to persuade

227
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
Sure enough, it won the favor of the emperor

228
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,640
You don't have to send anything to me anymore

229
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,280
I don't lack anything

230
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,839
The king asked

231
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,880
be careful

232
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,880
It was the cold

233
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,079
The prince will entertain you on my behalf

234
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,199
Then the king of Zhao came

235
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,119
it's been a long time our brothers

236
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,199
We didn't have a tour of Xiyuan together.

237
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,319
So today everyone

238
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,359
His Majesty as soon as he ascended the throne

239
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
Sui Lu was increased

240
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
King's grace is so mighty

241
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,160
My brother is grateful

242
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,239
I want to enter the palace to thank you

243
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,160
we are brothers

244
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,199
Don't be too polite

245
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,640
come and sit

246
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,719
Brother Xie

247
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,719
Ah Soo

248
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,400
come over

249
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
Wait until you finish the copybook I gave you

250
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,239
I'll take you to the falcon, okay?

251
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,319
real

252
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:52,920
Wei Wang since childhood

253
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,280
It's very close to His Royal Highness.

254
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,880
My favorite person in the world is my brother

255
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,680
royal brother

256
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,160
Although the prince is young

257
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,359
quite prestigious

258
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,760
popular again

259
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,400
Even King Wei admires him so much

260
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,839
No wonder my father used to tell us when he was there

261
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:20,599
This other day is also the emperor of peace

262
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,680
I am most concerned about

263
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,520
the suffering of the people

264
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,199
The court and the opposition

265
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:59,160
You are all serving the emperor

266
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,800
Loyalty for more than 20 years

267
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,760
It is the pillar of the country

268
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,479
If there is any omission in my future governance

269
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,359
i hope you

270
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Just take out this seal of guilt

271
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,199
close to hear

272
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,520
I

273
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,640
must consider

274
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,640
I give you this stamp

275
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,199
Just want to get along honestly between the ruler and the minister

276
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,640
What I don't like is flattery

277
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:36,079
I love to hear the truth

278
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
heartfelt

279
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,160
Thank you

280
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,800
Aiqing

281
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,800
What advice?

282
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,800
His Majesty's government is clear and bright

283
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,359
How dare you speak ill

284
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,640
All love

285
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,000
It is naturally a good thing that the emperor can accept advice and ask for advice

286
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,239
But today's garden tour is rare and easy

287
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,760
Why don't you just leave the government behind

288
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,680
wait until they think about it

289
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:26,920
It's not too late to make suggestions to the emperor

290
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,280
His Royal Highness said

291
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,160
Please, Your Majesty, Rong Chen, wait and think about it

292
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,880
As soon as I ascended the throne, I issued a petition for advice

293
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,920
to this day

294
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,479
no love advice

295
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,839
Okay

296
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,640
nothing more

297
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,359
everyone please

298
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,439
thank you your majesty

299
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,079
The fish this season is really delicious

300
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,359
father emperor

301
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,040
The fish is delicious

302
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,959
But it's a scum after all

303
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,079
extremely cold in the stomach

304
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,359
Dinosaur body

305
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,479
withdraw

306
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,920
Eat less oil, don't eat too much

307
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,520
In case you get sick

308
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
How can you accompany me to fly the eagle?

309
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,400
Brother is it not delicious?

310
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Brother, this is delicious

311
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,000
Obviously the best

312
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,160
Excuse me, is Yao Zhangshan here?

313
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,439
I'm

314
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,000
Meng Shangshi has orders

315
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,239
please come with me girl

316
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,640
is this frozen

317
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,000
really

318
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
melt-in-the-mouth

319
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,280
This chicken nugget is also very tender and delicious

320
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
Chicken cooked in advance with light vinegar

321
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
to be so fragrant

322
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,680
What is the use of this copper coin?

323
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,359
Miao Miao Miao

324
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,119
Deer carrageen is delicious with porridge

325
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,599
Please taste your majesty

326
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,160
The common practice of mandarin fish porridge is not common

327
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,359
Brother this is really interesting

328
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,160
It's just the Yuanzhen monk porridge in Yijianzhi

329
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,959
read a few books

330
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,560
Dare to show off in front of the royal

331
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,719
really interesting

332
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,959
If you love to read, you are not an elegant chef.

333
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,239
Brother, you are so weird today

334
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,560
Nothing is pleasing to the eye

335
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,160
How the hell did this cook offend you?

336
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,439
do i have

337
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:27,839
you read wrong

338
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,040
What is Hu Shangshi telling you to do?

339
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,040
what do you say

340
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,680
This is not what Meng Shangshi told me to lead you there

341
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,959
Meng Shang food

342
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,239
Are you serving the emperor's meal?

343
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,800
It must be the person in front of the imperial family who will send the message.

344
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:01,479
look

345
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,319
Your boots are full of mud

346
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,319
It is also worthy to serve in front of the emperor.

347
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,599
come

348
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,400
Come on, there are assassins

349
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,160
come

350
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,199
one more person

351
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,520
black mole under eyebrow

352
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,599
short stature

353
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:09,920
went over there

354
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,319
don't chase

355
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,199
Yes

356
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,040
what am i saying

357
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,479
how do you back down

358
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,680
People still can't tolerate you

359
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,599
isn't it coming now?

360
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:53,880
thank you sir

361
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,040
how thank you

362
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:03,880
Blood

363
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,760
The more you wipe, the more you see people

364
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,119
now what

365
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,719
can you still see

366
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,839
not soon

367
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,719
what's the matter

368
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,400
let me see

369
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
move me

370
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,760
what happened

Don't come here, get out of the way

375
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:17,760
Ah Soo

376
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,160

377
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,959
you get up

378
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:19,719
Your Highness

386
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,160
Yes

387
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,199
There may be something strange before King Wei goes out

388
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,199
no no

389
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,680
Your Highness was just fine.

390
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,719
what's the matter

391
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,280
it's staghorn

392
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,119
Your Majesty must be the sake of the antlers

393
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,319
who allowed you to talk nonsense

394
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,160
Carrageen grows in the mountains

395
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,959
Inevitably contaminated with snake venom

396
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:04,400
Mung bean soup must be blanched before eating

397
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,359
Now His Royal Highness King Wei is poisoned

398
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm afraid they neglected this

399
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,320
His Majesty's cooks are careful when preparing meals

400
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,919
Can't make such a big mistake

401
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:17,080
Or hurry up and ask the imperial doctor to treat His Royal Highness King Wei.

402
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,360
All cooks involved will be taken down

403
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,239
Who made the staghorn dish today

404
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,879
they

405
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,520
What happened

406
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,399
take away

407
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Why are you arresting people for no reason?

408
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,639
what are you doing

409
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,159
go fast

410
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,199
what did i do

411
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,760
open

412
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,520
let me go

413
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,919
less nonsense

414
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,479
what the hell did we do

415
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,679
let me go

416
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,479
what happened

417
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,600
quick

418
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,000
elder sister

419
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,280
can't go can't go

420
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,080
what happened

421
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,679
Hu Shangshi

422
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,399
today's event

423
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:34,600
Hu Shangshi

424
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,360
Fresh scallops delivered

425
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,719
They were all blanched in mung bean soup

426
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,120
Meng Shangshi and Ziping were wronged

427
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,760
I'm escaping myself

428
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,600
There is still time to care about other people's lives and deaths

429
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,199
You are really an extraordinary person

430
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:49,879
The grudge between you and me

431
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,639
It's not about business after all

432
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,439
Meng Shangshi and others imprisoned

433
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,040
The Food Bureau will surely lose its reputation

434
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,080
The errand for the imperial meal

435
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,639
It must be taken by the Shangshan Superintendent

436
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,280
So what's in it for you?

437
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,520
There is no recipe under the rule of Meng Shangshi

438
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,760
That's a big mistake

439
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,520
Until I officially take over in the future

440
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
Will take back the right to eat

441
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,080
You don't need a small palm and beak

442
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,479
Ke Jinyiwei

443
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,600
not from the rest of the staghorn

444
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,959
find any problems

445
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,199
How can you be so sure

446
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,320
Snakes crawled over venom residues

447
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,919
Who can guarantee the dish that King Wei is taking

448
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,879
no problem

449
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,679
Yuehua

450
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,520
you've been in the pantry

451
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,320
should have seen

452
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,959
all deer carrageen

453
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,639
They have all been poisoned with mung bean water.

454
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,159
i didn't see anything

455
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,239
Yuehua

456
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,239
on the plate of that dish

457
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,959
Only Yin Ziping and Fang Hanying

458
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,280
Let you escape

459
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,639
But don't you forget

460
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,959
In the future, there will be no Meng Shang Shibao for you

461
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,719
If you come to provoke without distinction

462
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,719
Don't blame me for being ruthless

463
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,679
Yuehua

464
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,280
I can win by strength

465
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,159
Why is it necessary to grow branches outside?

466
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,239
you wouldn't think

467
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,360
It's me who moved my hands and feet in the deer carrageen, right?

468
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,040
It's their own negligence

469
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,439
I bumped into the emperor's favorite young son again

470
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,719
It's God's gonna kill her

471
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,159
If the doctor diagnosed

472
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,360
King Wei's illness really has nothing to do with them.

473
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,719
King Wei suddenly fell into a coma after eating

474
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,639
How do they get away

475
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,919
Yuehua, you need to know

476
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,600
This is not man-made

477
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,919
Everything is God's will

478
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,879
what we do

479
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,360
Just stand by and watch

480
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,360
Understand

481
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,479
Yes

482
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,199
imperial concubine

483
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,320
King Wei is sick

484
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,919
Dai Court sentence

485
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,199
Everyone in the palace knows

486
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,479
My son was in good health before going to the park

487
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,360
He ate poisonous deer carrageen

488
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,159
Empress, this minister does not dare to make an assertion.

489
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,639
Now is not the time to investigate the cause

490
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,080
the most important is

491
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,560
It is to cure King Wei's disease

492
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,159
Sister Yao

493
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:48,719
evergreen

494
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,000
I've asked someone I know.

495
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,719
Wei Wang was seriously ill with high fever

496
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,320
His Majesty prayed for him personally

497
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,679
waiting all night

498
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,560
It's just that the imperial doctor has been unable to find the cause for a long time.

499
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,919
Meng Shangshi is afraid that there is more luck than luck

500
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,000
don't wait

501
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,919
I want to see the noble concubine

502
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,800
I really have something to say

503
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,840
Now King Wei is seriously ill

504
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,800
The imperial concubine is angry with Meng Shangshi

505
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,719
Don't say you can't see

506
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,000
even if you see

507
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,080
I'm afraid I'll even fold myself in.

508
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,919
evergreen

509
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,080
then you tell me

510
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,919
What are the symptoms of Wei Wang?

511
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,080
How can I know this?

512
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,320
move

513
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,600
Not only Meng Shang eats them

514
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,800
And Shanglinyuan Guanglu Temple

515
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,919
Anyone involved in this matter will be implicated

516
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,600
I can't care

517
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,560
You've been waiting here for two hours

518
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,320
You have done your best

519
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,560
Let's go back

520
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,080
let's go

521
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,600
evergreen

522
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,520
let's go

523
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,760
His Majesty

524
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,959
Although His Highness has taken the detoxification decoction

525
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,879
But he's too young

526
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,919
Puffy face now

527
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,239
Pulse float

528
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,919
I'm afraid I can't stand it

529
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,479
His Majesty

530
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,239
cocoa on his back

531
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,040
Toxic backlog in the lungs

532
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,479
redness, heat and pain

533
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,399
Your Majesty, you are most like you

534
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,760
usually infirm

535
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,919
How can you say he can bear this pain?

536
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,800
I want to spend this time peacefully

537
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,639
I really can only ask for God's mercy

538
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,840
His Majesty the Crown Prince is worried about King Wei's condition

539
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,120
see you again

540
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,919
let him go back

541
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,040
Yes

542
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,080
Your Majesty, you said that the old man is well behaved

543
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,239
How can you suddenly be poisoned?

544
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:12,320
Someone must have hated the concubine

545
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,080
Deliberately wanting the life of the old man

546
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:24,919
His Royal Highness

547
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,399
His Majesty said, please, His Royal Highness, please go back first.

548
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,760
Waiting for Wei Wang's condition to improve

549
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:31,800
Again

550
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,360
let's go Chen Wu

551
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Prince's Boxing Heart

552
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,800
Please refer to His Majesty

553
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:20,360
quick

554
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,320
To report to Hu Shangshi

555
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,159
Yes

556
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,080
queen concubine

557
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,040
Shang Food Bureau is wronged

558
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,600
to perform in person

559
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,879
you are so brave

560
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,120
How dare you come to stop the queen of honor

561
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,879
don't go back

562
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,360
The Queen's Concubine is still wronged by the food bureau

563
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,800
Ask the Queen to plead guilty

564
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,000
Someone drag her down

565
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:12,800
empress

566
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,320
Emperor Taizu set up a drum outside the Meridian Gate

567
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,919
Allow the injustices of the world to sue the Holy Spirit

568
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:21,120
Empress Xiaoci Empress Renxiao emulates the imperial court

569
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:23,560
In the harem, open the way to vindicate the grievances

570
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,560
But now the grievance is in front of the empress

571
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,959
How can you just sit back and watch

572
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,159
Don't stop her mouth

573
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:30,120
queen concubine

574
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:30,959
wait

575
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,800
Slaves see the Queen's Empress

576
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,719
Meng's omission made a big mistake

577
00:44:46,439 --> 00:44:47,719
You're still here to plead for her

578
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,679
take away

579
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:49,600
Hu Shangshi

580
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:52,919
How can you make assertions in front of the empress?

581
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,760
Really no grievance

582
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,280
Why can't I justify

583
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:57,639
not take away

584
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:58,719
Hu Shangshi

585
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,840
queen concubine

586
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,520
Don't listen to this banshee

587
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:05,080
She is a member of the Meng clan

588
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,800
Will do everything possible to excuse her

589
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,239
This slave maid will send her to Gong Zhengji

590
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:10,280
by example

591
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,040
She just mentioned Queen Xiaoci

592
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,000
Empress Renxiao

593
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,879
If you don't listen to her plea

594
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,080
I'm not merciful

595
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,239
Empress Taizu, the emperor, has long stated that

596
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,239
Only those who have serious grievances and secret serious feelings can complain about grievances

597
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,360
There are still people in the harem who deliberately falsely accuse

598
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,199
Implicate the innocent

599
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,840
How can she be trusted

600
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,879
In addition, this person shouted injustice in front of the palace and collided with the phoenix driver.

601
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,320
violate palace rules

602
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,479
Crash the phoenix

603
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
The slaves are willing to be punished

604
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,120
Just ask the queen to redress

605
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:39,800
you can think about it

606
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:41,439
If you repent when you are punished

607
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,760
be punished for causing trouble without cause

608
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,199
By then

609
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,320
I want to send you to Gong Zhengji plus a first-class crime

610
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,000
Beg the Queen's Concubine

611
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,199
empress

612
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:55,199
Okay

613
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,000
I fulfill you
