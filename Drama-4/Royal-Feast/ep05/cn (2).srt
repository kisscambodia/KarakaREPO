1
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:44,879
little women dare

2
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,239
please forgive me

3
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:59,400
plead guilty now

4
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
may reduce the sentence

5
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,239
The girl has a mole on the palm of her left hand

6
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,239
I remember really right here

7
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,240
don't pull

8
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,960
I will do it myself

9
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,520
see

10
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,279
sorry girl
Free at kisskh.me

11
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,960
a little woman abrupt

12
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,919
It's good to know the truth

13
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,960
Lord Liao Gongzheng said

14
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:08,360
There is no place in the world that Jinyiwei can't go to

15
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,399
There is no one who Jinyiwei can't arrest

16
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,039
but this does not mean

17
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,000
They can arrest innocents at will

18
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,720
this time

19
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,240
If I endure it any longer

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,440
What's the face of Shang Food Bureau

21
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
It's all a misunderstanding

22
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,880
If someone impersonates the palace, what if they plan to do something wrong?

23
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,720
Involving royal safety

24
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,919
easily neglected

25
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,800
Liao Gongzheng has now revealed the truth

26
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,839
If you are still unrepentant

27
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,720
search here

28
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,279
Can our errands be done?

29
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,199
There are no idlers in the food bureau

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
what to see

31
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,960
go back to do their own errands

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,559
Mr. You since the imperial concubine Zhaoxian left

33
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,960
Most of the palace affairs are managed by the Crown Princess

34
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,759
This Meng Shang food has always been favored by the princess

35
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,960
I was going to check it out and report back to you

36
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,000
But now it seems

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,759
Meng Shang food

38
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,679
can you promise me

39
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,160
There are really no impostors in the Shang Food Bureau.

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,759
Naturally no

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Okay

42
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,759
Since there is a guarantee of Meng Shangshi

43
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,320
Of course I have to believe

44
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,559
But in the future

45
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,600
If anyone finds out about the food bureau

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,079
There are really fake palace maids

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Meng Shangshi should be punished together

48
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,119
checked all

49
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,839
Talking is useless

50
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,480
You adult

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,279
please

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,559
When Lady Xiao was in charge

53
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
Strictly enforce the law

54
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,239
No successor now

55
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,519
It's getting worse

56
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,000
As early as the Hongwu period

57
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,519
The matter of cooking and drinking

58
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
food bureau

59
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,799
It follows the old example of the Taizu period.

60
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,519
Now it's being called a power grab

61
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,959
The food bureau is still like this

62
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,399
Not to mention the other sisters

63
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,119
Today's six innings and one division

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,040
The prestige of the past is gone

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
If only Empress Renxiao was still alive

66
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,640
All right

67
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,359
you come with me

68
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:00,799
follow me

69
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,720
Come with me

70
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,279
Come in

71
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,480
give me hand

72
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,239
Even the moles are ruined

73
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,640
your heart is so cruel

74
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,239
let go

75
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,559
you let me go

76
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,200
you

77
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm worried that Jinyiwei finds out that you have entered the palace as a fake

78
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000
So now I'm dead

79
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
suicide

80
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:10,839
can stop you

81
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,000
All this controversy and doubt

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,600
is not it

83
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
But you didn't think

84
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,679
Witnesses come so quickly

85
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:19,760
go

86
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,160
you follow me

87
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,119
I tell you

88
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,359
Now my troubles are over

89
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,760
here comes your trouble

90
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
you go with me to Meng Shang Shi's

91
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,640
make things clear

92
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,600
go

93
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:33,720
go

94
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,279
what to do

95
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,200
I won't confront you

96
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,279
I'd rather die than leave the palace

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I definitely don't

98
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,320
OK

99
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,320
A man who is not afraid of death

100
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,119
then you tell me

101
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,839
Is there anything scarier than death?

102
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
you will never understand

103
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,040
Thousands of households in Daming

104
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,000
Since ancient times

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,799
are all good

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,399
But there are countless pariahs in the area of ​​Zhezhi

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,880
Just because their ancestors were traitors

108
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,760
always discriminated against

109
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,799
Become a pariah from generation to generation

110
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,320
Not allowed to take the imperial examination

111
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,279
lifelong career

112
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
pretty woman

113
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,880
Once grown

114
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,079
to sell the pillow

115
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,080
Pay heavy taxes to the government

116
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,799
My parents lost their money

117
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
looking for crickets

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,239
just to escape

119
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,200
But it ended up being empty

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,880
do you know

121
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
My whole family is dead

122
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,919
only me

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,280
i don't want to hurt you

124
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,200
But how many people will be involved in the event of an incident?

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,719
so

126
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,000
you are for revenge

127
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,039
just entered the palace

128
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,200
revenge

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,559
I'm struggling to live

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,880
what am i revenge

131
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
who do i take revenge on

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,679
I don't want to laugh at the door like my mother

133
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,679
I don't want to bow down like my dad

134
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,919
I don't want to be like my brother

135
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,520
Killed by a cricket

136
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,919
I want to be an upright person

137
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,479
So I've been pretending to be stupid

138
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,840
I finally got my chance

139
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,679
escaped successfully

140
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,039
I've been to many restaurants

141
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,400
Be a handyman cook

142
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
they don't want girls

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,479
I don't want wages

144
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,280
i eat leftovers

145
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,760
no matter how they bully me

146
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,400
I also endure

147
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,640
Only in this way

148
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,159
I can stealthily learn the cooking skills of a cook

149
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,840
why are you looking at me like that

150
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:31,840
right

151
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,559
I'm from a scumbag

152
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,440
Almost made a skinny horse

153
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,440
I also steal other people's cooking skills

154
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
i'm a thief

155
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,320
The family of the prosperous landlord did not want to let their daughter enter the palace

156
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,320
Bought the eunuch

157
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,840
So I entered the palace

158
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,960
This is my only chance

159
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,599
only

160
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,400
Born in a cheap family, went to nowhere

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,679
How is it similar to her?

162
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,679
All right

163
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,280
All right

164
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,799
I tell you

165
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,119
Hanging and killing traces

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,359
are different

167
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,840
Don't be stupid again

168
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,840
Just do as I say

169
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,000
Meng Shang food

170
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,479
I have something to report

171
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,039
I quit first

172
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
what happened

173
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:33,799
do not worry

174
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,039
I won't repeat

175
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,200
just one thing matters

176
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
must let you know

00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,719

What's up

179
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,239
Isn't the eldest sister the most disciplined?

180
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,400
Why are you trespassing without reporting it?

181
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,520
You go down first

182
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
what are you doing

183
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,000
you understand

Concubine's forgiveness

185
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,119
Your Highness the past six months

186
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,479
The concubine Taisun sent people to the pharmacy department several times

187
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,719
Receive medicinal materials on the grounds of illness

188
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,599
Medicines are self-prescribed

189
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,119
After seeing the medicine, there is no major problem

190
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,919
let go

191
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,280
you are a brilliant doctor

192

Naturally knows how to collect herbs slowly

but i don't understand

Taisun Concubine is the supreme glory

195
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,919
Why do you want to die again and again

196
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,239
right

197
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,039
Of course it's good to be a concubine

198
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,760
high bed soft pillow brocade clothing and jade food

199
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,119
But Mrs.

200
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,320
If it's all based on human life

201
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,599
how do you want me to be happy

202
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,799
human life

203
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,479
what life

204
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,599
elder sister forgot

205
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,599
I didn't want to be my father's puppet

206
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
leave him at his mercy

207
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,799
He secretly went to his grandfather's house

208
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,719
Sometimes he's not in the pharmacy

209
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,559
I also took a prescription for him.

210
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,119
once

211
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,919
I prescribed medicine for a woman

212
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,440
within three days

213
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,440
It's one corpse and two lives

214
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,239
you quack

215
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,520
kill my wife

216
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,119
i want your life

217
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:08,559
stand up

218
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,960
what are you doing

219
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,520
smash me

220
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,799
Stop

221
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,559
Medical lazy

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,119
What kind of hospital do you run?

223
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,280
kill for life

224
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,799
stop

225
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,039
I can only blame you for not being good at medicine

226
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,039
disobey the father

227
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,719
Unauthorized medical rescue

228
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,080
The patient is pregnant

229
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,239
But you missed the medicine for promoting blood circulation and promoting menstruation

230
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,479
can it be okay?

231
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,200
The patient has three daughters

232
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,559
Poor family can't afford

233
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,280
I listened to her pleading

234
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I can't bear it

235
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,359
want to help her

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,359
Just because of your assertiveness

237
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,599
made a big mistake

238
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,359
If it weren't for my father's painstaking efforts to save

239
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,719
Can you still be safe here?

240
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
help me

241
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,119
help me

242
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,320
I thought it was because I was not good at academics

243
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,359
kill people

244
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,599
implicated grandfather

245
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,080
I want my father to cover up

246
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,760
So I'll just listen to you

247
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,359
Entering the palace as a concubine

248
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,239
But I didn't know until my grandfather got news.

249
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,479
for you to force me back

250
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,719
increased the dose

251
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,200
Kill the patient alive

252
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,239
elder sister

253
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,599
what does your heart do

254
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,359
For glory and wealth

255
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,880
so vicious

256
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,679
Grand Concubine

257
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,599
still sour

258
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,080
Your Highness

259
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:07,680
Your Highness

260
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,079
Your Highness

261
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,239
I am the auspiciousness you carefully built

262
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,079
It is your tool to seek power and wealth

263
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,439
Respectfully on weekdays

264
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,680
treat me like a gentleman

265
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,560
Now it's revealed

266
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,199
Finally no need to hide

267
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,439
every time you

268
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,400
Add a small amount of poison to the food

269
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,680
just waiting for the day

270
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,479
able to go unnoticed

271
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,239
Weakness and death

272
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,040
But I was stopped

273
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,359
But you still haven't given up

274
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:51,040
That day also accidentally implicated the emperor's grandson

275
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:52,479
right

276
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,479
you should be lucky

277
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,880
Grandson, he is fine

278
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,680
little madman

279
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,599
no matter how crazy you are

280
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,760
how painful

281
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,319
you have to remember

282
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,439
Thankfully it didn't spread

283
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,280
Otherwise not only will you die

284
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,239
Even the whole family will be buried with you

285
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,160
you don't care about the elder sister and father

286
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,640
But you always have to care about your mother

287
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
with innocent siblings

288
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,439
Be your great grandson

289
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,199
If the imperial grandson hates you

290
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,560
You are not even auspicious

291
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,119
Zijin, let me help you

292
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,839
Yin Ziping, come here

293
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:29,760
Hidden set

294
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,479
What is your order?

295
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,839
from today

296
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,760
You can't go into the big kitchen anymore

297
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:36,800
why

298
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:07,800
What happened

299
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,319
What did Yin Ziping do wrong?

300
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,319
Yeah, what did Yin Ziping do wrong?

301
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,400
Hidden set

302
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,439
Okay don't ask

303
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,319
get busy

304
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,800
I told Meng Shangshi

305
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,079
About Yin Ziping's real origin

306
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,319
you overheard our conversation

307
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,520
I don't understand why you

308
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,760
To give such people another chance

309
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,000
but I

310
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,560
would never work with such a person

311
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,959
But

312
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,719
Meng Shangshi is already in full view

313
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,000
Guarantee that no one is impersonating the food bureau.

314
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,959
so she is lucky

315
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,239
Even if the entire Shang Food Bureau

316
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,640
Everyone knows her secret

317
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,719
Nor will it be openly dismantled

318
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:13,920
After the storm

319
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,599
Find a way out

320
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,719
go away

321
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,520
Is what Fang Dianshan said true?

322
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,560
such a filthy man

323
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,160
do not know

324
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,719
let's go before we get tired

325
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,199
come in

326
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,439
Slower

327
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,000
ok ok ok

328
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,599
Just leave it here

329
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:56,760
come over here

330
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,040

331
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,280
Yuehua

332
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,719
The wound is alright

333
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:48,959
thank you

334
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,079
why are you still ignoring me

335
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,719
it's too cold outside

336
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,719
They asked me to send the bed out

337
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,719
Remember to take the medicine for a while

338
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,439
I'm in

339
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,520
you are lying

340
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,560
They all think I'm filthy and disgusting

341
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,959
how could you care about me

342
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,479
i have a teacher

343
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,479
Smart and beautiful

344
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,599
calligraphy and painting

345
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,959
she's a joy

346
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,400
same as beggar

347
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,800
are all scumbags

348
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,359
according to law

349
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,000
Happy households can't eat beautifully

350
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,520
Can not intermarry with good nationality

351
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
Can't even walk in the middle of the avenue

352
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,439
So she suffered cold eyes all her life

353
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,199
wandering everywhere

354
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,920
But she doesn't agree

355
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,599
Fighting all my life

356
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,439
the more humble

357
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,520
The more you can't lose your ambition

358
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,439
even if i want to change

359
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,520
There's no chance

360
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,760
My teacher

361
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,319
she loves to drink

362
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,719
drunk

363
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,359
she kept saying

364
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't agree

365
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't agree

366
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,160
I'm not convinced

367
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,319
that's what she is

368
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,319
So no matter if the world hates you, hates you and scolds you

369
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,079
One day you will prove to the world

370
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,119
You can be a decent person

371
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,800
I don't agree

372
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,800
I don't agree

373
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm not convinced

374
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,079
I don't agree

375
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm not convinced I'm not convinced

376
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,160
I'm not convinced I'm not convinced

377
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:14,959
okay

378
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,839
Drink the medicine in a while

379
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,040
go to the kitchen and sleep

380
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,239
it's warm there

381
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:22,959
I'm in

382
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:33,680
you

383
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,079
I am sorry

384
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,079
I know it's wrong

385
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,520
elder sister

386
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,520
elder sister

387
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,239
Don't you want to go to Siwansi?

388
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,719
we'll send it

389
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,760
thank you

390
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,040
Thanks for your hard work

391
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,640
Sister Yao treats people kindly

392
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,239
take care of us all

393
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,319
How good would it be if she served as a pawn?

394
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,599
let's go

395
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,359
Meng Shang food

396
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,520
I beg you

397
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,359
I beg you to promise me

398
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,920
Meng Shangshi, I beg you

399
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
I beg you

400
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,680
get up

401
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:40,680
Meng Shang food

402
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,959
you allowed me to cook

403
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,959
Do you have no self-respect?

404
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:18,839
really want to participate in the test

405
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,280
nature

406
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm not like you

407
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,160
Not even a shadow

408
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,680
see you

409
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,280
what

410
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,719
you chased

411
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,400
just to look at him

412
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,319
nothing more

413
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,880
One is a high-ranking royal aristocrat

414
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,839
One is a little palace maid with her head down to wash the dishes

415
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,160
distance between you

416
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,040
It's farther than the Tianhe

417
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
Maybe it's not fate

418
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,359
That's not necessarily

419
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:07,640
Can't tell, we're doomed

420
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,359
My mother was ill

421
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,560
I went north to live in my ancestral home

422
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,479
I think it's too restrictive

423
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,359
just run away

424
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,040
Play with the girls of the tenant's house

425
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,640
His Majesty brought the imperial grandson to familiarize himself with farming

426
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,640
I had a chance to meet him

427
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,280
do not move

428
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,640
you see

429
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,839
get up

430
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,119
come for a drink

431
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,680
go fast

432
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,439
What are you saying it's not destiny?

433
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,640
Fool

434
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,599
You are grateful for the small favors of others

435
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,280
do you know him

436
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,760
In case you want to understand

437
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,199
you don't like it
Free at kisskh.me


438
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,400
So you have to get to know the man

439
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,079
know what kind of person he is

440
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,839
Is it worth your love

441
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:45,359
You are young and know a lot

442
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,000
From time immemorial

443
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
Naturally beautiful and talented

444
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,880
I can listen to more drama

445
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,880
forever old

446
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,640
forever and ever

447
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:02,239
May all lovers in the world be married

448
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,800
Zijin

449
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,199
what do you say

450
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,400
I said the world is only willing to sing the West Wing

451
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,599
But I forgot the legend of Yingying

452
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,760
Mr. Shang Shi is busy with official business.

453
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,479
really make me wait

454
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,479
prince

455
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,040
The palace gate is locked

456
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,800
How dare you enter the palace privately

457
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,319
adults misunderstood

458
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,719
Today I play chess with my father

459
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,959
I'm going to accompany him tomorrow

460
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,640
So I only have to stay in the palace tonight.

461
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,800
then you shouldn't be here

462
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,040
Please

463
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,439
Facing the savior

464
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,599
You are as cold as ice

465
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,640
Your biological daughter reunites after a long absence

466
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,560
also indifferent

467
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,319
On ingratitude and ruthlessness

468
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,959
you think second

469
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
No one dares to be the first

470
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,079
it's you

471
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,359
it's me

472
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,599
I sent someone to send the news to Su Yuehua

473
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,599
To reunite you mother and daughter

474
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,400
I'm still really struggling

475
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
why are you looking at me like that

476
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,400
Don't be too impressed

477
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,800
you want to threaten me

478
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,359
Have you really forgotten my life-saving grace?

479
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,199
let me go

480
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,040
go away

481
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,199
help

482
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:03,839
stop me

483
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,360
go away

484
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,959
wronged

485
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,719
adult

486
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:23,679
presumptuous

487
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,280
adult

488
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,600
go away

489
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,520
my lord, I am a wronged lord

490
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm the wronged adult to let go

491
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,639
let go

492
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,800
adult

493
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
wronged

494
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,520
let go

495
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,840
then

496
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,600
I just killed one

497
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,080
drunken sinner

498
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:51,919
You killed your husband's brother

499
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,520
But you know

500
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,360
I kill my relatives because I refuse to rape

501
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,479
I am innocent

502
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,719
Lun Jigang is always better than right and wrong

503
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,080
according to law is a death penalty

504
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:07,000
But you shouldn't die

505
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
Encounter with the world of amnesty

506
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,199
Just absolved you of the death penalty

507
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,320
Later you were abandoned from the clan

508
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,719
I'm extra kind again

509
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,239
Let you enter the palace as a maid

510
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,159
You can be a decent chef today

511
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:24,360
Shouldn't I be the first to thank you?

512
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,639
When entering the palace

513
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,600
I'm just a humble maid

514
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,719
It's all up to me to be where I am today

515
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
Besides, I also helped you

516
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,919
Even if there is a great kindness

517
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,760
There's always a day left

518
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,520
Believe it or not

519
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,159
I helped you

520
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,840
never thought of getting anything in return

521
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
When I saw you for the first time

522
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,120
so I

523
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,479
what to laugh at

524
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:16,600
prince

525
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,439
why don't i tell you

526
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,239
From the day I killed Su Feng

527
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,280
The former Meng Ziyun is already dead

528
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,320
me now

529
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,159
is a fatherless

530
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,560
No husband and no daughter

531
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,919
more ungrateful woman

532
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,080
I can help you one last time

533
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:39,919
Say it

534
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,239
do something for me

535
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,719
get out

536
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,080
His Royal Highness

537
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,679
Father

538
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,679
Father

539
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I just saw that you were in a hurry

540
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,639
Are your legs uncomfortable again?

541
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,760
I'll give you a click

542
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,520
Come

543
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,600
Daughter

544
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,879
Your Highness

545
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,399
You know that your father loves the king of Han

546
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,840
More than a day or two

547
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,760
Why do you have to suffer so much

548
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,879
During the second brother's stay in Beijing

549
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,239
The chariot and horse equipment used by the royal family for many times

550
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
and never returned to the fief

551
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,719
Ministers call for impeachment

552
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,879
The father heard the report

553
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,959
humiliating me for being obese

554
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,679
no relatives

555
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,760
I haven't seen the ministers for many days

556
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:08,760
Let alone instructing them to impeach Gao Xu

557
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,959
I know my father loves my second brother

558
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,360
But I am also his relative

559
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,320
close relative

560
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,959
Is it because

561
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,760
fat and thin

562
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,919
Your father's heart is so narrow

563
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:34,719
Your Highness

564
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,479
Your Highness is cautious

565
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,000
The grandfather of the emperor is too old

566
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:45,199
Everything must be according to his will

567
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,639
Can't contradict anywhere

568
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,080
The second uncle acts arbitrarily on the surface

569
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,600
But he fought with his grandfather for many years

570
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,479
Outstanding military exploits

571
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,600
It is necessary to prevent him from being pretentious and deliberately tempting

572
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,639
The father's difficulties, the son understands

573
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,639
But he was angry with his second uncle

574
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,320
It's better to go to the emperor's grandfather's side and offer the soup and medicine in person

575
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:07,919
To show the sincerity of a filial son

576
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,239
unspeakable resentment

577
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,639
Abandoned dry city

578
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,199
Okay

579
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,280
good son

580
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,479
I go out to catch my breath

581
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,879
Your Majesty let you think behind closed doors

582
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,199
where are you going

583
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,000
If the emperor put me in prison

584
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,360
you are the jailer

585
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,000
If you keep it, you will keep me for twenty-seven years

586
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:51,600
what's the matter

587
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,639
I now

588
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,280
Don't you even have the freedom to go out and take a breath?

589
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,399
jailer

590
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:15,800
Mother

591
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,239
leave first

592
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,199
go

593
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,000
Did you check it out?

594
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,399
Today, the King of Han did not enter the palace to defend himself

595
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,919
But after lunch, His Majesty suddenly became furious

596
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,159
Urgently ordered the prince to meet

597
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,239
lunch

598
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,320
These are all returned by the Qianqing Palace.

599
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,159
Yes

600
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,360
Your Majesty has not touched the lunch delivered today.

601
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,600
all back

602
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,439
this is

603
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,080
This is a dessert made by Meng Shangshi himself

604
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,239
In those days, Song Taizu attacked the Southern Tang Dynasty for a long time.

605
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Anxiety, worry, not eating

606
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
fell ill in the barracks

607
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,000
Lucky to have a chef

608
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,719
Locally grown orange cake

609
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,479
Dessert made from walnuts

610
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:59,120
Only then did Song Taizu turn the corner

611
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:02,639
Since then, this dessert has made great achievements

612
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:04,239
called the Great Rescue

613
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,520
The slaves heard that when the war was going on

614
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:14,080
whenever the emperor is in danger

615
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,399
Han Wang disregarded his own safety

616
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:19,439
Rush into thousands of troops with fine horses to save them

617
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,879
Turned the tide of the battle many times

618
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:23,320
Therefore

619
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,439
Whenever the emperor sees this dessert

620
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,000
will recall the filial piety and merits of the Han king

621
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:36,080
back off

622
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,080
Yes

623
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:54,120
It seems that your food bureau is not very peaceful.

624
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:02,719
Thank you princess for your forgiveness

625
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,719
The slaves promised to help the King of Han

626
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:07,560
It is also expedient

627
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:11,159
I just wanted to find out what his plans were in Beijing.

628
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,639
Will it be detrimental to His Royal Highness
