1
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,160
Your Highness

2
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,639
Your Highness

3
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,360
Brush the kebabs with this creamy ghee

4
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,839
Why use ghee?

5
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,600
back to His Majesty

6
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
Use different fires when grilling meat

7
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,839
such as firewood, charcoal

8
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,960
taste is different

9
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,119
different meat
Free at kisskh.me

10
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,839
The way of roasting is also different

11
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
such as the burnt

12
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,639
Originally a famous dish in Kaifeng in the Northern Song Dynasty

13
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,160
Brush with pepper brine when roasting

14
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,199
But Your Majesty's constitution is easy to get angry

15
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,880
The slaves deliberately switched to butter ghee

16
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,119
thank you your majesty

17
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,759
I have been waiting for a long time

18
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,919
stop baking

19
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,880
all old

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,479
father emperor

21
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,119
be careful

22
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,479
not very crisp

23
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,880
His Majesty

24
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
bake with ghee

25
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
Take the first bite

26
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
must be crispy

27
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,639
if crisp

28
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,479
It must have been overcooked.

29
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,479
father emperor

30
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,640
Father, do you remember?

31
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,480
once

32
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,320
Son ordered someone to come

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,359
Bring you roast lamb

34
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,799
It was Erchen's first time hunting.

35
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,119
downed ibex

36
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,200
this time

37
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,119
It is lamb ribs with more beautiful meat

38
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
more fragrant

39
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,279
burnt

40
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,279
burnt

41
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,040
i mean

42
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,720
That lamb was burnt last time you roasted

43
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,440
Completely inaccessible

44
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,720
because at that time

45
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,399
It was the first time my son came to bake in person

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,679
no experience

47
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,040
Yao Dianshan

48
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,799
Grilled meat is very greasy

49
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,880
Your Majesty used to have a toothache after eating it

50
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,920
how can you give

51
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,119
Souji Zen

52
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,600
I added to the seasoning

53
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,320
A pinch of slightly spicy thyme powder

54
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,799
Can remove fire and smell

55
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,359
Can also be seasoned

56
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,519
Your Majesty is eating

57
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,480
It is accompanied by the chrysanthemum drink to remove the fire

58
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,279
As long as it matches

59
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,040
Roasted meat can resist the cold

60
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
There is also the therapeutic effect of nourishing and warming

61
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,320
not to mention

62
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,679
at the banquet that day

63
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,559
Sushi and Hu Shangshi

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,399
Isn't it also grilled meat?

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,640
His Majesty

66
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,040
Slaves are careful

67
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,279
Meal prepared for you

68
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,040
what is this

69
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,559
Hurry up

70
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Your Majesty please try

71
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,600
how to have shares

72
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,040
The taste of scallops

73
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,000
His Majesty said it

74
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
The fish belly is also specially added

75
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
winter bamboo shoots and mushrooms

76
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,119
Sea cucumber and scallops

77
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,440
Chicken Qing

78
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,119
pork to season

79
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,799
because of net oil

80
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,920
And the bread is tightly wrapped

81
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,359
Although the fish is grilled

82
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,000
yet fresh and not greasy

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,920
fragrant

84
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,799
This Roasted Mandarin Fish with Flowers

85
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,720
And nourish the heart

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,359
Remove oily smell

87
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,959
mandarin fish

88
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,440
rich and rich

89
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,440
good sign

90
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,399
why don't you eat

91
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,640
father emperor

92
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,320
When Erchen was practicing swords just now

93
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,000
the wind

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
some discomfort

95
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,679
Retired first

96
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,279
Xuan Shengyin

97
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,359
Yes

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,839
Unexpected day

99
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,959
you will also run

100
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,359
Your Majesty, come to please

101
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,440
Zijin

102
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,799
get out of my way

103
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,000
empress

104
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,840
go

105
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,280
go see

106
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,080
Your Highness
Free at kisskh.me


107
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,880
The slave's right hand is inconvenient

108
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,919
Forget it, Yuan Qi will come.

109
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,880
I'm afraid some people are clumsy

110
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,440
hurt me more and more

111
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,880
It's just bitter meat

112
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,679
why

113
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,159
And let me mention the wild lamb

114
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,799
thousands of miles

115
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,719
from Khurmus

116
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,719
brought back opal

117
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
see if you like it

118
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
back to your highness

119
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,359
slaves dare not say

120
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,559
Say it

121
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,640
forgive you

122
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,359
Gentleman far son near grandson

123
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,400
how

124
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,039
Famu is far from fire and near earth

125
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,159
in the heart of the emperor

126
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,400
Your Highness

127
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,960
Is the beloved good grandson

128
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,400
His Majesty

129
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,359
It is the eldest son who is to blame at every turn

130
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,599
often needed

131
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,400
You and the empress have come to considerate

132
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,280
that lasts forever

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm afraid even His Highness himself thinks that

134
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
The emperor can successfully inherit the throne

135
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
There is a part of your credit in

136
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,000
That is naturally in your heart

137
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,000
Just one less for Your Majesty

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,080
Ru Mu Zhi Si

139
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,400
awe

140
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,880
You are too bold

141
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
your hands are not good

142
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,000
Back to His Highness

143
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,080
Imperial Physician Sheng's Rejuvenation

144
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
The injury has greatly improved

145
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,359
The two countries are fighting for strength

146
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,200
Form a team to win or lose

147
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,479
The winding road leads the way

148
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,919
Will keep the deep palace ring expedition

149
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,359
Take the risk and get out of the car

150
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,479
Flying guns across the river under the heavy city

151
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,359
Learn about military affairs

152
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,080
Seeing peace with success

153
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,520
This is the father

154
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,159
When I was the Crown Prince of the East Palace

155
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,280
A poem written to Zeng Zidi

156
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,000
The poem is about chess

157
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,719
hidden

158
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,960
when today

159
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,400
to establish peace and prosperity

160
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,599
Mind and Courage

161
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,200
you say so

162
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,880
more like me

163
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,359
Know more about my father

164
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,080
As soon as the emperor ascended the throne

165
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,799
Stopped the official purchase

166
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,400
Dozens of bursts

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
Disaster relief tax exemption

168
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,559
light-hearted

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
rest with the people

170
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,000
It is to rectify the government

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,039
open the way

172
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,640
past dynasties

173
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,719
There are some heroes who started a national business

174
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
There is a holy master who maintains ZTE

175
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,119
But as generous and merciful as His Majesty

176
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,799
A virtuous master who loves the people

177
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,599
also famous for later generations

178
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,919
Shine with the sun and the moon

179
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,679
If it comes to the emperor's holy

180
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,840
That's three days and three nights.

181
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,919
just one thing

182
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,280
Queen Mother

183
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,320
how are you here

184
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,919
I heard that your old injury relapsed on the school grounds

185
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,479
I specially accompany your father

186
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,280
come and see

187
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
so is your child

188
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:50,919
injured

189
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,280
Why don't you say a word

190
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,039
Worrying for the Queen Mother

191
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,239
It's all sons and daughters

192
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,640
let's continue

193
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,520
His Majesty

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,960
The slave's mouth is unobstructed

195
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,320
sin deserves death

196
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,000
no problem

197
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
what did you say today

198
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,960
I won't blame you

199
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,679
Your Majesty the Father

200
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,400
this bold girl

201
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
say your exploits

202
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,559
will be famous

203
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,200
didn't ask you

204
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,400
you just told me

205
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,799
Three days and three nights of merit can't be finished

206
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,080
The only thing wrong

207
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,840
what's the matter

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,239
a little lady

209
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,000
How dare you talk about the emperor

210
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,559
should be punished

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,479
Say

212
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,679
His Majesty

213
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,919
The slaves also listen to the discussions in the market

214
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
they said

215
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:48,799
them

216
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,359
say yes

217
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,640
they said

218
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,280
Traitors and criminals of the Jianwen Dynasty

219
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,239
have been subdued

220
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,280
just pity them

221
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
innocent wives

222
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:57,880
suffer from

223
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,400
shut up

224
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,400
Say

225
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,559
They are all implicated

226
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
or sub-lijiaofang

227
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,479
or become slaves with heroes

228
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,520
Some were even exiled for thousands of miles

229
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,039
dead in a foreign land

230
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,559
When His Majesty came to the throne

231
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,400
Zeng pardoned the world

232
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,239
praised by the people

233
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,479
Grace is like the radiance of the rising sun

234
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,559
Even sinners can be forgiven

235
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,200
But

236
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,359
This radiant light

237
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,280
Why can't I take care of myself

238
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,640
The most miserable person in the world

239
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
Out of madness, but not back

240
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,280
father emperor

241
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,159
This is just an ignorant girl

242
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,799
you are kind and generous

243
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,280
Don't compare with her

244
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,919
I inherit the throne

245
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,200
King's Landing

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
Can the world be wide

247
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,760
The complexity of common affairs

248
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,400
Can I be alone

249
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,000
I am making a request

250
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,880
sincere

251
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,159
But few speakers

252
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,520
Road is congested

253
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,400
Up and down

254
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,799
Fang You officials corrupt and miscellaneous

255
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,640
Tsunade is slack

256
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,799
Today there is a harem maid

257
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,200
actually told me the truth

258
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,760
How can I blame her

259
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,039
i said

260
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,559
merit must be rewarded sin must be punished

261
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,159
You are

262
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:32,919
back to your majesty

263
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,400
Slaves are the classic meals of Shangshi Bureau

264
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,159
Your Majesty bestows you a promotion

265
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,039
not soon thank you

266
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,400
The slaves thank the saints

267
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,559
take good care of you

268
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,760
Let's go to Nanjing when the injury is healed.

269
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,280
Thank you father for compassion

270
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,440
queen

271
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,359
Deal with the family members of the rebels

272
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,200
It was the will of the imperial examination that year

273
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,760
nowadays

274
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,280
if i forgive them

275
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,479
Wouldn't it go against the will of the Emperor Kao?

276
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,799
Where the harem maid

277
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,719
Don't talk about things outside the palace

278
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,400
Since His Majesty asked

279
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,200
The concubine had to answer

280
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
His Majesty is more than ten years old

281
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,159
served by Emperor Taizu

282
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,799
Naturally abide by the ancestral teachings

283
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,960
Emperor Ming's ancestral teaching has something to say

284
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,520
Extra law and punishment are intended to warn the world

285
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,119
Not the usual method used by the Shoucheng Emperor

286
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,479
Later descendants became emperors

287
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,280
Obeying the Law and the Great Rule

288
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,640
no penalty

289
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,520
Fear of misconduct

290
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,719
Injured innocent

291
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,359
The female family members of the back house are innocently affected

292
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,959
His Majesty forgave them

293
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
It is to follow the ancestor's teaching

294
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,920
queen

295
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,520
These words

296
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,400
is it in your heart

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
hold for a long time

298
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,560
Although the maid was daring just now

299
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,160
but said

300
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,560
His Majesty's thoughts

301
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,479
I am the queen of your majesty

302
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,880
Of course you should be worried

303
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,040
deliver an imperial order

304
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,760
The traitor in Jianwen

305
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,880
The main offender has been known to be murdered

306
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,040
Family first-time education department

307
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,040
Jin Yiwei

308
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,199
Coat of arms

309
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,000
and trainers and

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,439
Slave in the family of the hero

311
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
if there are survivors

312
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
Amnesty

313
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,359
You can be for the people

314
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,640
return the soil

315
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,640
Your Majesty Shengming

316
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,280
Your Highness

317
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,040
all right now

318
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,800
The slaves retire

319
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,000
you use me

320
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:20,280
Your Highness

321
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,959
His Majesty came suddenly

322
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,800
The slaves are also at a loss

323
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,199
think about it

324
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,119
I got injured on the training ground

325
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,479
The emperor will definitely come to test himself

326
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,239
You guessed he was coming

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,640
Your Highness

328
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,560
your mess

329
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,520
I can't find the north even if I hold my father and emperor.

330
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,479
your actual purpose

331
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,760
In fact, for

332
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
Exiled female relatives plead for mercy

333
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,520
Your Highness Misunderstood

334
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,000
really wronged

335
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,040
How dare a slave

336
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,359
not telling the truth

337
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,479
Your Highness

338
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,439
those innocent women

339
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
because of the family's fault

340
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,400
once relegated to

341
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
They are forced to entertain people with sensuality

342
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
humiliated

343
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,280
this unfortunate situation

344
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,680
How similar to my mother

345
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,199
Your Highness

346
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
The maid also helped you

347
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
if not

348
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,719
Your Highness has set off for Nanjing.

349
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,479
I really shouldn't

350
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,640
send you a rabbit
Free at kisskh.me


351
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
i should send a fox

352
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,479
just for you

353
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,520
Pretending to be good-natured in front of me again and again

354
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,359
It's all fake

355
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,479
I

356
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,599
fraud

357
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,439
Your Highness also lied to me

358
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,719
what

359
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,680
Your Highness said earlier that he would let me go

360
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,199
Are you telling the truth?

361
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,199
Your Highness lied to me that I didn't read the military book

362
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,560
I don't know what it means to retreat

363
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,319
You do everything possible

364
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,079
Just to deceive me

365
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,719
all right now

366
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,839
The slaves retire

367
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,839
It's true

368
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,680

also true

370
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,760
what are you going to do

371
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,640
don't push me

372
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,520
I have something urgent to report

373
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,040
Your Highness is busy

374
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,800
Your Highness

377
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:34,719

378
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,040

Yao Sishan

381

Yao Sishan

382
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,479
Sister Yao

383
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,520
Yao Sishan is back

384
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,599
Congratulations to Sishan Hexi Sishan

385
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,880
Yao Si's hand is injured

386
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,119
But a blessing in disguise

387
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,280
Rewarded by His Majesty

388
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,119

00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,439
Great luck

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,880
ok ok ok ok

395
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,760
alright, alright

396
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,959
We all take Sister Yao

397
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,160
Can't breathe

398
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Sister Yao

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,959
later became a chef

400
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,119
Do you want to teach us how to cook?

401
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,680
yeah yeah yeah yeah

402
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,079
Do you want to teach us how to cook?

403
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,880
Sister Yao must teach us how to cook.

404
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,319
Yes, teach us more

405
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,839
teach us a little more

406
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,800
go go go go

407
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,640
go to work

408
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,359
Yao Sishan

409
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,239
The Queen's Concubine

410
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,520
Yao Sishan, don't move

411
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,760
Let's Jiang Si Yao

412
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,040
Diagnose and treat for you

413
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,319
her medical skills

414
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,880
Comparable to Ligong Recuperation Pansiyao

415
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Even smarter

416
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,359
How is Jiangsi Medicine

417
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,719
Please report back to the Queen on your behalf

418
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,280
Yao Sishan's right hand

419
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,400
Great improvement

420
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,319
As long as the spoon does not go into the kitchen

421
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,239
will not strain the muscles

422
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,760
she is in good health

423
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,160
Just a little sullen

424
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,959
I think it's due to the daily fatigue

425
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,560
Just take a good rest

426
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,079
It's okay

427
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,199
I'll prescribe some more yakuju pills

428
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:55,800
Rejuvenating Qi and Treating Depression

429
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,160
tired

430
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,719
congratulations

431
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,079
What does this mean?

432
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,760
come in

433
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:24,839
stop her

434
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,199
let me go

435
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:27,719
open

436
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,800
Ali

437
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,040
old lady

438
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,439
I, Ali, canonize the crown prince and concubine

439
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,079
hairpin ring to use

440
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,520
must use the best

441
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,560
old lady

442
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Prince Concubine

443
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,479
old lady

444
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,280
Crown Prince Concubine

445
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,520
Requires the gift of envoy canonization

446
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,359
Ritual can't be messed up

447
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,719
The Empress has already ordered

448
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,439
Let the old lady decide everything

449
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,560
Yes

450
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,000
East Palace is justifiable

451
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,760
prince of a country

452
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,479
Why risk sending someone to assassinate

453
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,920
If it's what the prince did

454
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,680
How can you send a young army to join in?

455
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,800
Isn't it a big fanfare to tell people

456
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
Who is the mastermind behind the scenes?

457
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,640
Doubtful about this

458
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,839
Your Majesty can't be trusted

459
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:36,760
I have my own opinion

460
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
you are seriously injured

461
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,040
don't worry

462
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,160
His Majesty

463
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,560
Everything is Jinyiwei

464
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,319
Poor verification

465
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,560
It's the minister's negligence

466
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
Your Majesty, please forgive me for three days

467
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,680
The minister must re-investigate

468
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,119
Find out the real mastermind

469
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:50,800
trouble

470
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,520
His Royal Highness arrives

471
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,599
father emperor

472
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,040
Erchen sent people to visit

473
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,199
just got the news

474
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,560
On Aoshan Lantern

475
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,719
artisan laying gunpowder

476
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,280
already on the night of the celebration

477
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,719
being silenced

478
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,280
Afterwards, the emperor took pity on the craftsmen

479
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,239
innocently affected

480
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,680
not only blame

481
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,640
Also to the unfortunate artisan who lost his life

482
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,959
be pampered

483
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,079
this person

484
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,119
also escaped

485
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:21,959
Jin Yiwei's interrogation

486
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,800
No wonder

487
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,800
The craftsmen of this strict trial

488
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,400
all living

489
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,520
who else

490
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,760
Doubt a dead man?

491
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,479
His Majesty

492
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,359
Evidence must be found in this man

493
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,000
his master

494
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,560
ten years ago

495
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,640
The old man of the Han Dynasty

496
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
King of Han

497
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,160
are you alright

498
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,479
Your Highness

499
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,959
You are recovering from a serious injury

500
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,599
come to defend me

501
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
I should be thanking you

502
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,760
This framing trick

503
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,400
really despicable

504
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,160
The emperor was only angry for a while

505
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
to be deceived

506
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,400
Your Highness, don't worry

507
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,280
It's something else

508
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,280
I am worried that someone will take this opportunity

509
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,680
The strategy of adjusting the tiger away from the mountain

510
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:22,880
Your Highness be careful

511
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,520
Do not leave Beijing recently

512
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,000
take good care

513
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,280
can be fished out

514
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,239
Okay

515
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,280
This placement

516
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,560
Pay attention to the location

517
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,319
Okay

518
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,920
The plate should be laid out layer by layer

519
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,760
don't get in the way here

520
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,160
not going out

521
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,719
I'm also the chef of the Food Bureau

522
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,239
palm meal

523
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,520
a pariah

524
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,359
This life ends here

525
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,760
Wait until I take charge of Shangshi Bureau

526
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:21,800
maybe still

527
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,000
How about some scraps for you?

528
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,000
His Majesty

529
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,959
His Majesty

530
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,880
It's windy here

531
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,959
Let's go back sooner

532
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,599
Chest tightness recently

533
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,280
let's go

534
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:58,920
Liu Gonggong

535
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,760
His Majesty is still worried about the assassins

536
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Your Majesty is here

537
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,319
still rude

538
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
Shangshi Bureau tribute fresh pastries

539
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,280
May your majesty be happy

540
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,839
be careful

541
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,199
Thank you for your grace

542
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,199
how about sushi

543
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,880
but you're not alone

544
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,319
Will it please His Majesty?

545
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,079
It seems that I really underestimate you

546
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,040
not

547
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,000
Your Majesty Chrysostom

548
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,000
If there is something delicious

549
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,040
fun meal

550
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,640
allow me to offer

551
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,079
you don't know much

552
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
no medicine diet

553
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,000
How can I prepare myself for Your Majesty?

554
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,280
But it is

555
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,760
Just a moment of freshness

556
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,359
Wait until it's fresh

557
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
Let's see how to put you back in shape

558
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:28,119
Then you take a good look

559
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,239
How did I rise to the top

560
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,599
crazy crazy

561
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,079
What about Zijin?

562
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,000
except her

563
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,160
No one can control Yin Ziping

564
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:38,959
what about people

565
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,560
What are you doing?

566
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,439
come out

567
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,119
Your Highness

568
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,719
what are you doing

569
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:15,640
doorway

570
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,000
Ali

571
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,599
old lady

572
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,040
Can't go in there, old lady

573
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,359
old lady

591
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,000
His Royal Highness

592
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Don't be too polite

593
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,000

594
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,000

596
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
didn't you hear

597
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,319
Grandma is looking for Ali

598
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,119
haven't brought it out

599
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,359
Yes

600
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,000
grandmother

601
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Just now I have been listening to you shout

602
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,160

605
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,359
old lady

606
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,239
His Royal Highness in person

607
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,520
Named this raccoon slave

608
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,400
Inkstone

609
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,359
grandmother

610
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,319
I still have business here

611
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,439
you go back to rest

612
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:22,680
no

613
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,319
come

614
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,199
Don't hurry up and send the old lady back

615
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,880
Your Highness

616
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,520
slow down

617
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,000
His Royal Highness

618
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,000
His Royal Highness

619
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,000
I

620
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,000
come out

621
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,760
Chen Wu

622
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,239
Grandmother just passed away

623
00:31:59,239 --> 00:31:59,959
call her back

624
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:00,880
Yes

625
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,359
Your Highness

626
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,920
really go you

627
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,000
Your Highness, what does this mean?

628
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,959
Why so afraid of my grandmother

629
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:26,520
Ali

630
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,199
Ali

631
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,520
Ali

632
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,680
where did i go all day

633
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:43,319
Where does Mrs. Peng Chengbo follow?

634
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:46,000
I really have nowhere to hide

635
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,119
Entered His Highness' study

636
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,000
anyway

637
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,839
They can't search here.

638
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,520
Your Highness, please forgive me

639
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,119
You even dare to use me

640
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,800
Why are you so afraid of her

641
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,719
Your Highness still remember

642
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
I am seriously ill

643
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,719
Is it about going out of the palace to recuperate?

644
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,520
The imperial physicians in the palace are helpless

645
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,959
If it weren't for the old lady, she wouldn't give up

646
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,199
Hire famous doctors everywhere

647
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,479
I'm afraid I'm no longer in this world

648
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,119
the hardest time

649
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,000
Only the old lady refused to abandon me

650
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,439
Old lady's recommendation

651
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,359
It is to consolidate the power of the Zhang family.

652
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,160
but she treats me

653
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,719
I can't be ungrateful

654
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,959
you really want to be a foodie

655
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,479
Don't look at Sishan and Shangshi

656
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,160
only one level away

657
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
It's really different

658
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,520
how old are you

659
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,760
I want to be the head of a palace

660
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,680
really shameless

661
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,719
Your Highness

662
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,920
mocking others so much

663
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,520
It's not what a gentleman does

664
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,119
I didn't laugh at others

665
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:55,520
I just laugh at you

666
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,239
Then I never knew Your Highness

667
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,640
Your heart is so bad

668
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,400
i never knew

669
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
Your heart is so deep

670
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,719
what are you talking about

671
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,520
You come to me on your own initiative

672
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,719
don't you just want me to pity you

673
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,959
take the initiative to cover up for you

674
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,120
you are waiting for me

675
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,639
Praise your mother in person

676
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,439
you are free

677
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm being tortured now

678
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
It's all because of you

679
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,919
you use me again and again

680
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,199
never soft

681
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,520
I am to you

682
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,919
soft-hearted again and again

683
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,159
Take the initiative to help you carry everything

684
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,959
Is it fair?

685
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,560
Has your Highness thought about it?

686
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,479
Maybe I have nowhere to go

687
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,360
Go ahead

688
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,760
Yes

689
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,919
Your Highness

690
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,000
let's go

691
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:06,439
where to

692
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,280
Kunning Palace

693
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,919
Kunning Palace

694
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,040
Your Highness

695
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,919
Didn't you say it all

696
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,000
She won't get it this time

697
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,919
all her wishes

698
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:17,919
I want it all

699
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,280
just because i don't want to

700
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,639
see her sad again

701
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Your Highness

702
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,879
it hurts

703
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:39,040
let go let go

704
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
get down to business

705
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,679
what are you doing

706
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,040
This is

707
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,639

708
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,040
Meal for His Majesty

00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,040
you help me see

710
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
is there anything wrong

711
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,199
Steamed pork belly

712
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,439
Burning sheep's head and hoof-stuffed chinchilla

713
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,719
These are too greasy

714
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,639
Don't repeat the mistakes of Yuehua before

715
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,919
You want to make Bazhen cake

716
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,600
I was about to ask you to teach me

717
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,760
His Majesty has been feeling unwell recently

718
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,959
This is the pharmacist

719
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:18,719
tell me

720
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:19,879
Bazhen cake can be prepared

721
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,280
Your Majesty's Weak Spleen and Stomach

722
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,360
And the miraculous effect of puzzle and soothing

723
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:24,719
fit for His Majesty

724
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,239
Ziping

725
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,679
You are obviously incompetent

726
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,120
We should take advantage of strengths and avoid weaknesses

727
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,120
Why do you suddenly think

728
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,239
Want medicine?

729
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,120
of course

730
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,479
not right

731
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,719
His Majesty

732
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,280
Guo Guifei today

733
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
See you for the third time

734
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,000
not see

735
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,280
Yes

736
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,959
Your Majesty Your Majesty

737
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,719
Your Majesty, are you alright?

738
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,600
His Majesty

739
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,879
imperial physician Xuan imperial physician

740
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:51,919
His Majesty

741
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,840
Please bring your majesty's meal list

742
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,479
princess

743
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,360
The doctor has checked

744
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,520
No blockages in meals

745
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,719
queen concubine

746
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,000
All meals

747
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,600
The minister has carefully checked

748
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,159
Nothing wrong with

749
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,320
Your Majesty suddenly fainted today

750
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,239
I'm afraid it's just a relapse of an old disease

751
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,040
It's about His Majesty's Dragon Body

752
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,560
not to be taken lightly

753
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,239
Dietary non-toxic

754
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:51,280
Doesn't mean they're innocent

755
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,639
Food is the same as Chinese medicine

756
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,159
if they collide with each other

757
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,080
harmful rather than beneficial

758
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,080
Still need to check

759
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,560
to draw conclusions

760
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,719
How can you say this is good?

761
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:15,800
This Eight Treasures Cake

762
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,879
who did it

763
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,159
back to the princess

764
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,520
Bazhen cake is made by slaves

765
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,600
Inside this eight treasures cake

766

The Eight Treasures of the Palace

773
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,600
It is the prescription prescribed by Yitai Hospital.

774
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,239
need to combine the last two flavors

775
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,479
replace it with ginseng

776
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,560
And deer antler

777
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,280
confused

mother

779
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,120
I just checked

00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,879
Medicinal recipes used by the emperor on a daily basis

781
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,399

enough is enough

785
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,560
Now the female chefs of Shangshi Bureau

786
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,840
Little knowledge of pharmacology

787
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,399
Dare to use medicinal food easily

788
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,360
Father emperor weak spleen

789
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,080
Supplement like this

790
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,159
This is not life

791
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,320
Are you sick?

792
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,120
queen concubine

793
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
Your Majesty has been in poor health recently

794
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,959
The Food Bureau is acting cautiously

795
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,560
The list of medicated meals should be reported to the Tai Hospital first.

796
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,719
Medicated diet prescribed by Tai Hospital

797
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,760
Pharmacy Division dispenses medicinal materials

798
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,159
What medicine to take and how much

799
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,199
all recorded

800
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:28,120
Never dare to make any mistakes

801
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,479
The person in charge of the pharmacy department of the Taiyuan Hospital

802
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,159
should also be punished

803
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,560
Knowing that the father and the emperor are empty and will not be compensated

804
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:37,479
Let the Shang Food Bureau make medicated meals

805
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,399
especially deer antler

806
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,040
frail person

807
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,080
Once overdose

808
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
just too much blood

809
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,040
even appear

810
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,399
hematemesis syndrome

811
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:48,719
In my opinion

812
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,399
The person who made Bazhen Cake this time

813
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,360
with a loving heart

814
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,239
Complete disregard for the emperor's dragon body

815
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,040
should be severely punished

816
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Are you guilty?

817
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,280
Do not plead guilty to the queen

818
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,800
queen concubine

819
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,959
Your Majesty likes to eat meat

820
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,520
Irregular spleen and stomach

821
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,959
Physicians for
Free at kisskh.me


822
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,280
Replenish your body for His Majesty

823
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,919
Prescribing plenty of supplements

824
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,280
such as deer antler and ginseng

825
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,159
Lingzhi etc.

826
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,280
As the princess said

827
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,120
Too much supplements can also hurt the body

828
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,280
but

829
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,399
All medicines in the palace

830
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,080
and how much

831
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,840
They are all drawn up by the Taiyuan Hospital.

832
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
with medicated meal

833
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,360
There are many precious medicinal herbs

834
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:34,040
To prevent others from stealing for profit

835
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,399
There is also professional supervision

836
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,840
so

837
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,479
The Food Bureau can't decide the dose

838
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,520
you can

839
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,840
shirk responsibility, right?

840
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,520
so

841
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,719
When slaves deliberately use ginseng

842
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
simmered for hours

843
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,639
Ginseng into charcoal

844
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,159
Still quietly in the clear water of the noodles

845
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,840
Added raw carrot juice

846
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,919
raw radish juice

847
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,000
Yes

848
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,719
imperial concubine

849
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,239
Raw radish juice is cool

850
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,719
It can also reduce phlegm and stagnation

851
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
Detoxification

852
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
You can still breathe

853
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,000
dissolved in supplements

854
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,159
Excessive medicinal properties

855
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:11,239
Radish

856
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,479
It can also digest and appetizer

857
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,719
to His Majesty's body

858
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,199
absolutely beneficial

859
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,800
so

860
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,600
Your Majesty is sick

861
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,520
It has nothing to do with Bazhen Cake

862
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,239
It seems

863
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:24,520
you know

864
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,360
The medicated food prescription given by the Tai Hospital is inappropriate

865
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,800
Still hiding

866
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,120
Why hide the truth?

867
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,000
stop holding on

868
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,159
step by step

869
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,280
hot

870
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,320
You used to speak bluntly in front of me

871
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,679
With such courage

872
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,320
Why not put the truth

873
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,439
tell everyone

874
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,159
back to His Majesty

875
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,080
In the meal recipe of Bazhen Cake

876
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,000
with supplements

877
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,679
indeed to your majesty

878
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,040
Has the effect of nourishing the body

879
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,360
It's no fault in itself

880
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,760
It's just that His Majesty previously believed

881
00:43:17,399 --> 00:43:18,879
Ginseng is added to the prescription

882
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,239
Deer antler is effective

883
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:21,800
The doctors

884
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,199
dare not disobey

885
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,560
Fear of overdose

886
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,360
If the slaves report truthfully

887
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,159
easily misunderstood

888
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:31,239
In case something goes wrong

889
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,120
will involve a lot of imperial physicians

890
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:34,840
And the women of the pharmacy department

891
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,639
It is better to start with Codonopsis and deer antler

892
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:39,800
to replenish vitality

893
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,719
Use radishes to calm down

894
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,600
You won't get sick

895
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:47,600
as a cook

896
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,520
More than just a delicious meal

897
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,120
also empathetic

898
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:53,879
get things done

899
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,000
still so lawful

900
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,879
as a chef

901
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,800
I really feel sorry for you

902
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,320
i think

903
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,399
Concubine thought

904
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:05,959
Let's make her a concubine
