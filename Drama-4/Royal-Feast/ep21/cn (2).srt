1
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,919
Your Highness

2
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,679
Do you think I'll get pissed off?

3
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,679
eventful

4
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Your Highness, this tortoise paste may be a little fishy

5
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,479
do you want to use something else

6
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,160
i'm angry now

7
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,479
Don't you know I'm on fire

8
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,000
take away

9
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,800
Yes

10
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
add honey and osmanthus

11
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,839
go quickly

12
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,080
go here

13
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,119
What's wrong?

14
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
It's just a medicine for a woman's body

15
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,839
get off

16
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,440
Strange

17
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,679
Why is Miaoxian also taking medicine and you are taking medicine too?

18
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,520
And you didn't ask for a doctor

19
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,639
how

20
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
It's your recipe

21
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,959
I've never seen anyone around you

22
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,720
The screen is too young

23
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,399
The mother is afraid that she will not be able to take care of it

24
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,359
So I chose

25
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,880
Four clever maids brought it

26
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,760
queen concubine

27
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,079
This morning, the East Palace sent everyone back.

28
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,119
means princess

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Mother, this is the meaning of the son's own

30
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,399
go down

31
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,720
Yes

32
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
it doesn't matter if you don't like it

33
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,440
Tomorrow I'll send someone to take four more

34
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,640
mother

35
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm not blaming you

36
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,519
if you are normal

37
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
I will never interfere

38
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
but are you

39
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,040
you are the prince of the east palace

40
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,279
prince of a country

41
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,359
If there are no children

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,839
Who will bear the heavy responsibility in the future?

43
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
Mother and son are still young

44
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,799
sooner or later there will be children

45
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Why are you so anxious

46
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,799
i can't bear

47
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,040
I don't even bother to make trouble for my daughter-in-law.

48
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,079
But the world is waiting and watching

49
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,679
Looking forward to the birth of Daming's future heir

50
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,119
How about this

51
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
The concubines of the East Palace

52
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,079
If you don't like

53
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,760
then choose

54
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,279
Choose until you are satisfied

55
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,839
They are all fine

56
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
The son is not dissatisfied

57
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,720
they are all good

58
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,040
But none of your favorites

59
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Mother, if you send someone over again

60
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,920
Erchen will send it back as it is

61
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,399
Don't worry about this

62
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,160
Erchen resigns

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,799
Junji

64
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,279
This is your inescapable responsibility

65
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,119
you bring me back

66
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,160
master

67
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,279
this kid

68
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,559
Why doesn't he understand

69
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
If I don't embarrass them today

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
They will become sinners

71
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,399
as long as there are children

72
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,040
They can no longer be blamed by the world

73
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,239
to really have a way to live

74
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
Mother's pain

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,279
His Highness has not yet realized

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
So what to do now

77
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,239
Since he doesn't like the person who sent it

78
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
Then pick one he likes

79
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,000
what are you doing

80
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,679
Meng Shang food

81
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,920
His Royal Highness King Wei coughed late at night

82
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,760
I read it in the herbal medicine

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,399
Fifty holes made from one frozen pear

84
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,679
stuffed with pepper

85
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,600
Then wrap it in hot ash and simmer it until cooked

86
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,959
After cooling, remove the peppercorns and eat

87
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,239
Relieves cough

88
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,959
so i want to give it a try

89
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,679
Remember what I told you before

90
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,440
What is meal preparation?

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
so-called meal preparation

92
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,959
is to fully consider the needs of the diners

93
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,440
Do your best to preserve the original flavor and essence of the ingredients

94
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,079
Recreate delicious and delicious food

95
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
Since you choose to specialize in medicinal diets

96
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,839
Remove the physique of those who pay attention to the meal

97
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
It is very important to choose food

98
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,519
let's talk
Free at kisskh.me


99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,760
How did you choose the medicine pear

100
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,040
recorded in this sketch

101
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
Only Xuancheng's milk pear

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,640
There are also Yali in Jingzhou County and Beidu

103
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
suitable for medicine

104
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,960
But after my few trials

105
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,359
I found this year's tribute to the perfume pear

106
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,520
also has excellent effects

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,039
So I took it out this time.

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,840
It is good to know how to identify pharmacopoeia records

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,840
But what?

110
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
The eater is a child

111
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,599
Too much pepper

112
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,919
he won't like

113
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,320
Instead use ghee and honey

114
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,320
and

115
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,119
Pear peel clears the heart, reduces fire, promotes fluid and quenches thirst

116
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,239
medicine itself

117
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Wouldn't the medicinal properties be greatly reduced if the pear peel was removed?

118
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,039
You humbly said that you are not good at medicated diet

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
I almost believed it

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
as a cook

121
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,239
Always pay attention to the characteristics of the food in the world

122
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,479
understand

123
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,840
clear

124
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,599
Xie Mengshang index finger

125
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
Zijin Zijin

126
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,159
Meng Shang food

127
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,320
Order of Kunning Palace

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,719
Shang Shang Food Bureau presents a fruit box for supper

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
Only these cooked potatoes are left.

130
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,799
China's good taro is more than betel nut taro

131
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
The most delicate mountain taro

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,159
It is the best ingredient for making taro paste

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
What about sliced ​​steamed pork?

134
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,760
It has to be Fenghua big taro

135
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
This little taro

136
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,039
Made of sweet-scented sweet-scented taro seedlings and scallion oil taro

137
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,840
wouldn't it be good

138
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
So what about this

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Lai Zijin

140
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,919
come help me

141
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:04,719
Yes

142
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,200
Meng Shang Food, please stay

143
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,239
go

144
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes

145
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,880
The queen concubine doesn't often eat at night

146
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:44,320
Meng Shangshi only took cooked taro chips and torreya seeds

147
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,599
Fried Almonds in Sauce

148
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,359
Serve with Parsley and Bijian Soup

149
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,320
Can strengthen the spleen and stomach, soothe the nerves and help sleep

150
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
Invite the Queen to dinner

151
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,119
remember our bet

152
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,880
Silly girl, what are you doing?

153
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,039
who can stand against the royal

154
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,359
Hold on like this

155
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,479
Who in the world can save you

156
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,599
princess

157
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,559
The princess calms down

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
wait for me to persuade

159
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
she'll change her mind

160
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,159
The world is born as if in a cage

161
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,039
to get back to nature

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,760
Unless it turns into a handful of loess

163
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,960
You haven't said a word for half a year

164
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,000
Facing this old window all day

165
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,119
Do you really think that

166
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,559
Can you get out of this world?

167
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,719
The person who can replace you is like a crucian carp crossing the river

168
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,520
It's just that I don't allow resistance

169
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
Let no one say no to me

170
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,119
princess

171
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,239
Ali is the one who I watched grow up

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,799
It's a courtesy number

173
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,479
good girl who knows the rules

174
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,679
Please look at my thin face

175
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
give her another chance

176
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,479
Silly boy

177
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,799
refused to enter the palace

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,039
there are only two ways left

179
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,280
renunciation or death

180
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
you are so young

181
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,359
Do you really have to twist your hair?

182
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:50,719
Will you be with the ancient Buddha with the blue light for a lifetime?

183
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,679
The princess forced me into the palace

184
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
Don't be afraid of causing disaster

185
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,000
Name has been set

186
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,760
I advise you not to be delusional

187
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Honestly be your grandson

188
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,919
But I'm not reconciled

189
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,359
can you bet

190
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,039
Waiting for you to realize the prosperity of this noble place

191
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,400
saw my son again

192
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
All the unwillingness will come to nothing

193
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:37,919
By the time

194
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,799
I'm waiting for you to beg me

195
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,359
give you this grace

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
You've been in the palace for some time.

197
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,919
Know what is the supreme place in the world

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,679
Back to the Queen's Concubine

199
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,080
the so-called royal family

200
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,760
wealth and glory supreme power

201
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,119
There is no one else in the world

202
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
Have you ever seen the prince

203
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,359
His Royal Highness is wise and wise

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
smart decision

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
Have a kind heart that loves the people

206
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,719
I will order tomorrow

207
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,719
make you prince concubine

208
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,640
Slave, thank the queen for her kindness

209
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,119
Please take your life back

210
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,039
What did you say

211
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Slave's blessing is shallow

212
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,200
ashamed

213
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,479
Seeing the imperial power but not admiring the imperial power

214
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,599
Knowing the glory but not envy the glory

215
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,599
you are comfortable

216
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,000
But between you and him

217
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,320
There is a destiny destined by God

218
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,520
Are you willing to cut it off too?

219
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,479
slave

220
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
When entering the palace

221
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,200
always have resentment

222
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,960
Can get along with His Royal Highness day and night

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,679
A cavity of ice and snow also melted because of him

224
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,520
empress

225
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,799
The slaves sincerely admire His Highness

226
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,239
But affection and freedom eventually have to make a choice

227
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,520
Slaves do not want to be concubines

228
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,359
Please concubine

229
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,840
do you know what you are talking about

230
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,080
Niangniang promised that the slaves would let me go

231
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,960
How dare you speak so arrogantly in front of me

232
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
I am the ruler of this harem

233
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,320
As long as I don't let you go

234
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,039
you will be obediently in this harem

235
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,359
be your prince

236
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,359
Descendants of the royal family

237
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
naive and stubborn slave

238
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,160
Unreasonable

239
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,319
Not worthy to serve His Highness

240
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,280
How dare you say such a thing so boldly

241
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
No matter how hard your bones are

242
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,040
Hard but sharp axe

243
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,560
Your will is firmer

244
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,800
Unable to shake the supreme imperial power

245
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
The reason why you can talk to me like this

246
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,920
Nothing but taking advantage of my tolerance and compassion

247
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,680
Wait until you run out of my last bit of patience

248
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Your brother, your Sun's nine clans

249
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,520
will collapse in an instant

250
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,839
Everybody says

251
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,040
The Queen's Empress is gentle and gentle

252
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
But they all got you wrong

253
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Your will is stronger than any man

254
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,079
Decisions are also far beyond comparison

255
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,560
But

256
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,880
Yuxin's desire

257
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,959
Even if you die nine times without regret

258
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,479
The slaves retire

259
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,959
The Queen's maid is so rude

260
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,439
You shouldn't forgive her anymore

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,760
Really soft, sweet, crispy and delicious

262
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,000
When I was in trouble

263
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,079
She could just sit back and watch

264
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,280
But she ran for me regardless of her past suspicions

265
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,079
mother is right

266
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,359
she is a good boy

267
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,319
empress

268
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,160
I just wanted to see

269
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,719
Is there really anyone in this world who dares to disobey the imperial power?

270
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,439
even

271
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,359
resist fate

272
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,920
wait for me here

273
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,800
The eldest sister invites you late at night

274
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,199
what's the matter

275
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,319
what is this

276
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,920
seeker

277
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,040
I don't need it

278
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,640
If the eldest sister came to me for this

279
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,760
Then I'll go back first

280
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,040
The princess takes it

281
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,119
I said I don't need it

282
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
elder sister

283
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,839
It doesn't really matter whether you have children or not.

284
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,640
Sister sincerely pray to God

285
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,040
May you live in peace and joy

286
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
This wish is enough

287
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,439
elder sister

288
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,599
Why do you keep saying such strange things tonight

289
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,560
elder sister

290
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,560
elder sister

291
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,199
Ziping

292
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,760
What are you stunned for?

293
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,479
How can you be so stubborn?

294
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,680
fine

295
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,119
really okay

296
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,800
But this tofu practice knife skills

297
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,599
I don't know when to practice.

298
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:26,800
what

299
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,239
Last time I saw Fang Dianshan making Wensi tofu

300
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,359
Later, I heard that there was a tofu banquet.

301
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,000
There are one hundred and fifty-eight tofu dishes

302
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,599
She's on fire

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,439
Facing that piece of tofu every day

304
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
I don't know what I'm doing

305
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:54,599
come with me

306
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,560
Your Highness

307
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,640
Although His Majesty has exempted the golden beads of Cochin

308
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,839
Purchasing of Shaanxi Sichuan Tea Class

309
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,680
But there are still many places to buy forced levy and forced collection

310
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,760
Labor and wealth

311
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,959
For example, the red lacquer azurite that pays tribute every year

312
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,760
Regardless of local production

313
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,839
Collect all

314
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
Forcing people to sell property

315
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,640
Buy Dan Lacquer Azurite at High Prices

316
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,079
to complete the government's apportionment

317
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,479
Profiteers take the opportunity to drive up

318
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,079
As a result, the price has jumped dozens of times

319
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,359
People go bankrupt

320
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,719
Why are you stopping me from writing?

321
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,800
I don't think you are scolding profiteers

322
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,319
you are cursing

323
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,400
The eunuchs sent by the father to various places to buy

324
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,680
do you know

325
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,239
those sent by the father

326
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,640
Most of the people he values

327
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,400
Some are even confidants who have served for many years

328
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,239
Do you think the father believes in you or them?

329
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,680
I can't let someone like you

330
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
hurt by slander

331
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
I am now a censor

332
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,599
have the responsibility of supervising the divisions to report wrongdoing

333
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,599
Don't sit back and watch eunuchs become miserable

334
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,000
Chaos my Daming Jiangshan

335
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:02,800
Your Highness, you should also be wary of the villains around you

336
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,439
Don't be fooled by them

337
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:35,880
Your Highness

338
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,719
reward you

339
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,160
Your Highness

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,719
good tea

341
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,839
good tea good tea thank you sir

342
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,800
Gentle water nourishes all things

343
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,800
The tyrannical water destroys fields and hurts people

344
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
so people repair waterwheels

345
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,479
Xingtianyuan builds dams to prevent disasters

346
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,079
water is so

347
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,319
so do people

348
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,599
The eunuch followed the emperor's grandfather to fight for many years

349
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,400
There's a lot of talent around

350
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,319
indeed one

351
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,880
Righteous and brave young talent

352
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,439
what

353
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,439
go

354
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,400
here and here

355
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,959
return

356
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,359
How did you come

357
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,000
I come to see your sweetheart

358
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,560
Zheng Sanbao's bravery and skill in several voyages to the West

359
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,280
Ye Shiha has sent slaves to dry many times

360
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,119
Appeal to local ethnic groups

361
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,280
Of course

362
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,959
There are also private messages from the inner court

363
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,479
The scheming Huang Yan

364
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,599
Eunuch and Water

365
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,199
It is not even different from Baiguan

366
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,400
Neither good nor evil

367
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,280
Just see how to use it

368
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,560
Your Highness is wrong

369
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,599
The blade is held in the hand of the knight

370
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,199
can be chivalrous

371
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,760
in the hands of bandits

372
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,400
a murder weapon

373
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,959
The Ming Dynasty is about all people

374
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
The sage today is merciful, the prince is virtuous

375
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,319
Hold on firmly to this blade

376
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
But who can guarantee

377
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,199
In the Ming Dynasty, there were sage kings and heroes.

378
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,319

00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,640
Yes

382
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,359
you

383
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,640
Impeached Jin Yiwei again

384
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,599
impeach the eunuch

385
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,119
How many times have I told you

386
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,359
what's on your mind

387
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,520
Just tell me privately

388
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,599
You swear so unabashedly

389
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
Be careful someone behind the back makes a cold arrow

390
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,199
Since His Highness knows that he is a villain

391
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,079
Why stay by your side

392
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,920
when i was young

393
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
Yuan Qi is waiting by my side

394
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,479
Accidentally fell from a horse

395
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,479
He rushed over to guard

396
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,520
Seriously injured for a year

397
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,319
Shaoyuan

398
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,800
Even a humble boy

399
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,800
also flesh and blood

400
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
I'm going to cook

401
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,199
It's too delicious

402
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,119
Zijin

403
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,839
You say this stinky tofu

404
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,920
smells so bad

405
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,520
Why does it taste so delicious?

406
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:04,920
incense bar

407
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,920
Zijin

408
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,040
The first piece is mine

409
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
You are not allowed to steal mine

410
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,119
my my

411
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,760

412
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,000
give me a bite too

413
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,319
Eat slowly, be careful

414
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,239
Zijin

415
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,280
just ran so fast

416
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,280
ask you you ignore me

417
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,719
What are you doing now?

418
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,599
I

419
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,000
taste it

420
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,000
Meng Shang food is here

421
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,040
This year's Shangyuan Festival

422
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,839
Long live lanterns for Aoshan to be set up in the palace

423
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
pray for world peace

424
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,280
Your Majesty will also reward a hundred official banquets

425
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,119
You gotta cheer up

426
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,319
deal with it

427
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,319
Yes

428
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,479
Meng Shang food

429
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
if i remember correctly

430
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,520
test between us

431
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,119
No winner yet

432
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Hu Shangshi

433
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,160
It has come to this point

434
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,599
Are you still not willing to give up

435
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,800
No matter what, I'm still a foodie

436
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,719
On grade

437
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,199
not yet

438
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,680
you are arrogant in front of me

439
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,719
Is this still necessary now?

440
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:31,959
Meng Shang food

441
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,640
You are already the master of Shangshi Bureau

442
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,400
But a test is a test

443
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,079
no winner

444
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,839
How to be convincing

445
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
This third

446
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
are you willing to fight

447
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,400
What is the bet

448
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,640
Shangyuan Festival

449
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,839
We will try this

450
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,760
If I get lucky

451
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,599
Meng Shangshi wants to be in front of the world

452
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,680
Admit that the skill is inferior to others

453
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,680
if i lose

454
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,079
please leave the palace

455
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,520
Never set foot in the Forbidden City again

456
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,640
how

457
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
as you wish

458
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:33,680
if not she is

459
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
sister of the princess

460
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,959
How could she be allowed to linger for so long

461
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,920
now humiliating

462
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,119
Meng Shangshi didn't take the opportunity

463
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,239
expel her from the palace

464
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,079
Are you right? Zijin

465
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,439
don't say this

466
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,640
You promise me two things, okay?

467
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,040
two pieces

468
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,359
sweet bean flower

469
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,920
How can tofu brain be sweet?

470
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,599
Back to His Highness

471
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,199
It was prepared by Shang Food Bureau

472
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,199
How is tofu brain sweet?

473
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,239
tofu brain why

474
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,119
make it sweet

475
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,319
what's in there

476
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
Back to His Highness

477
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,319
it's inside

478
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,680
maybe it's sugar

479
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,520
or syrup

480
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,959
It could also be osmanthus

481
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,680
I don't know the exact slave.

482
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,000
How can anyone in this world

483
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
Put sugar in the tofu brain

484
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Your Highness does not know

485
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,880
grandmother

486
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,839
He is from Jingzhou Prefecture

487
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,479
Made for ministers since childhood

488
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,520
It's this sweet bean flower

489
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,199
Especially sweet and delicious

490
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:54,560
This

491
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,959
But it's obviously a pot

492
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,079
How to taste salty and sweet

493
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,119
No taste at all

494
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,479
The servant saw it with her own eyes

495
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,199
that is a

496
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,280
The copper piece that divides the pot in two

497
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,040
smeared on copper

498
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,160
concrete

499
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,839
After the slaves asked

500
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:11,880
talk again

501
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,680
what a joke

502
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,079
Tofu brain can only be salty

503
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,280
I'm done with the first errand

504
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,599
will you help me again

505
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,920
I never heard you mention it before

506
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,839
you two

507
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,959
Did you meet outside the palace?

508
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
Since he likes him

509
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,400
Why do you keep pushing me?

510
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,280
I've just been in the kitchen for a while

511
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,479
limited salary

512
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,959
Daughter's golden pearl and jade

513
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,439
I don't even have a ropa sweater

514
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,599
those poems

515
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,359
i don't understand

516
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,680
How to express affection

517
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:02,920
Only do one or two

518
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,079

519
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,160

Yoshiko collar

522
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
I beg you Zijin

523
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,239
Yoshiko collar

524
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,840
I will be grateful to you for the rest of my life, okay?

525
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,520
go, go, go, go

526
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,199
Ziping

527
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,000
go

528
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,239
Let Shang Food Bureau in the future

529
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,560
No more sweet tofu brain

530
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,399
Yes

531
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,760
Your Highness

532
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,800
This book

533
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,040
It seems that Mr. Mei borrowed it.

534
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,800
he forgot

535
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,000
The slaves will send it over now

536
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,040
Give me

537
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,159
Sweet smell all over the house

538
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,879
go out to relax

539
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,560
really someone

540
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,159
I love sweet tofu

541
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,120
Mr. Mei

542
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,639
Yao Dianshan

543
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,439
This is the meal for you by the Food Bureau

544
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,000
thank you

545
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,239
Your Highness, what do you see me doing?

546
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,439
What about the food box?

547
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,959
what food box

548
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,719
That's not for His Highness

549
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,280
Your Highness

550
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,959
This can't fall

551
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,159
you give me give me

552
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,040
Didn't His Highness say it himself?

553
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,439
Don't let anyone mention it again

554
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,080
The slaves naturally dare not disobey

555
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,679
Take the twenty rods yourself

556
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,760
Your Highness Your Highness

557
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,719
that's supply

558
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,919
The tea and rice of the ministers entering the palace

559
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,320
It stands to reason

560
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,719
This should be done by Guanglu Temple

561
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,199
But they fool around all day

562
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,840
rice is done

563
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,080
How hard to eat, how hard to eat

564
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,199
Guang Luqing was just reprimanded by His Majesty

565
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,719
for the purpose of organising the annual banquet

566
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,639
take this shit

567
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,600
Push it to the Food Bureau

568
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:20,959
really

569
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,679
absolutely true

570
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,919
didn't say a word

571
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,560
food boxes are

572
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,719
handed it from me

573
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,320
Then why do you have to laugh so happily?

574
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,320
accepted

575
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,439

There must be a misunderstanding

620
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,879
What is the misunderstanding?

621
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,320

669
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,959

when the accident happened

677
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,520
Luckily you got in the way

678
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,399
really hit the head

679
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm afraid it's forever

680
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,000

681
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,320

682
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,320
Are there any hidden dangers in her hands?

00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000

specific situation

687
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,879
until she wakes up

688
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:40,840
make another judgment

689
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:43,959
from now on

690
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,879
The rest move out of here

691
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,600
make her feel at ease

692
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,199
Give her medicine first

693
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,399
Yes

694
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,760
Although drinking should be warm

695
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,439
but also different wines

696
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:23,479
different wine

697
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,439
use different heat

698
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,520
That way, it doesn't lose its original flavor

699
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,159
I always know that cold wine hurts the stomach

700
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,159
overheating and lung damage

701
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,040
So only use warm wine

702
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
But I don't know the time to warm the wine

703
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,360
