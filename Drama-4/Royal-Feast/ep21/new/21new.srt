468
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Sweet bean pudding

469
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,881
How can bean curd be sweet

470
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:25,560
Back to your highness's words

471
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:27,160
It was prepared by the Food Bureau

472
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,160
How is bean curd sweet

473
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,200
Why is bean curd

474
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,080
Make it sweet

475
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,280
What the hell is in here

476
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:41,641
Back to your highness's words

477
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:43,280
It's inside

478
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,641
It's possible that it's sugar

479
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,481
Or syrup

480
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,920
It could also be sweet-scented osmanthus

481
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,641
I don't know the specific handmaiden either

482
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:53,961
How could anyone in this world

483
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:55,641
Put sugar in bean curd

484
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:58,521
Your Highness doesn't know

485
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,841
My grandmother

486
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:00,800
It is a native of Jingzhou Prefecture

487
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
I made it for my minister since I was a child

488
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,481
This is the sweet tofu pudding

489
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,160
Especially sweet and delicious

490
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,521
This

491
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:08,920
But this is obviously a pot

492
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:11,040
How do you taste salty and sweet

493
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,080
It doesn't smell at all

494
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,440
The handmaiden saw it with his own eyes

495
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,160
That's a

496
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,241
A piece of copper that divides the pot into two

497
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,001
The copper sheet was smeared

498
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,121
Specific

499
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,800
After the handmaiden asked

500
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,841
Talk back and forth again

501
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,641
What nonsense

502
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,040
Tofu can only be salty

503
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,241
I've done the first favor

504
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:51,560
Why don't you just help me one more time

505
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,881
I've never heard you mention it before

506
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:56,800
You two

507
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
Did you meet me outside the palace

508
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,121
Then since I like him,

509
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:02,361
Why do you keep pushing me

510
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,241
I just became a palm meal.

511
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
Limited salary

512
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,920
Gold pearls and jade from my daughter's house

513
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,400
I don't even have a ropa khan towel

514
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:11,560
Those poems and words

515
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,320
I don't understand either

516
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,641
How to express affection

517
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,881
Only do one or two

518
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:16,040
A delicious meal

519
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,121
To the fullest of one's mind

520
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,361
Just help me this time

521
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:20,640
Haoziliao

522
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:22,961
I'm begging you, son

523
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,200
Haoziliao

524
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,801
I am grateful to you all my life

525
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,481
Go, go, go, go

526
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:32,160
Purple Azolla

527
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,961
Go on

528
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Let Shangshi Bureau in the future

529
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,521
No more sweet bean curd

530
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,360
Yes

531
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,721
Your Highness

532
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,761
This book

533
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:49,001
It seems that Lord Mei borrowed it

534
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:49,761
He forgot to take it

535
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,961
The handmaiden will send it now

536
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,001
Give it to me

537
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,120
A house full of sweet odors

538
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,840
Go out for relaxation

539
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:04,521
There is really someone

540
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,120
Love sweet bean curd

541
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,081
Lord Mei

542
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,600
Yao canon meal

543
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,400
This is the meal for you from the Shang Food Bureau

544
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,961
Thank you very much

545
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,200
Your Highness, what do you see me do

546
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:51,400
Where's the food box

547
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,920
What food box

548
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
That's not for your highness

549
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,241
Your Highness

550
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:01,920
This, this can't fall

551
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,120
You give me give me give me

552
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,001
Didn't your highness say it himself

553
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,400
No one is allowed to mention it again

554
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,041
Handmaiden naturally dare not disobey

555
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:12,640
You go and get twenty sticks

556
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,721
Your Highness Your Highness

557
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:16,680
That's the supply

558
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,880
Tea and rice for ministers entering the palace

559
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,281
It stands to reason

560
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,680
This deserves to be Guanglu Temple Office

561
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,160
But they fool errands all day long

562
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:22,801
Cook a meal

563
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,041
How bad it tastes

564
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,160
Guangluqing has just been reprimanded by your majesty

565
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,680
On the grounds of organizing the annual banquet,

566
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,600
Take this errand

567
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,561
It was pushed to the Shang Food Bureau

568
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,920
Really

569
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:34,640
It's absolutely true

570
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:38,880
I didn't say a word of redundancy

571
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:39,521
The food boxes are all

572
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:40,680
Pass it through my hand

573
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,281
Then why smile so happily

574
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,281
Accepted

575
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:54,400
Great, great

576
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:56,801
Now I can get revenge

577
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,801
Make way, make way, make way

578
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,920
You say it again

579
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:19,920
Fresh Meat Lantern Festival

580
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:21,081
I'm using

581
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:22,961
Bamboo insect bee pupa grasshopper

582
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:28,281
Don't you look at me like that

583
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:31,160
Fried bee pupae is crisp and tender

584
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Is it a top-grade delicacy

585
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,081
Yin Ziping

586
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:35,400
You are clearly

587
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,440
Deliberately bullying Lord Mei

588
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,920
Sachet sachet

589
00:37:58,521 --> 00:37:59,481
Run slowly

590
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:04,521
Pain, pain, pain

591
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,440
Why did you steal

592
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,200
You let go of me

593
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,241
Don't learn well at a young age

594
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:09,481
Go with me to the yamen and let go

595
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:15,680
I didn't steal the money I didn't steal

596
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,840
You let go of me

597
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,321
You let go of me

598
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,880
What's going on

599
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:22,721
This man steals

600
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,081
Arrest it for me

601
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:24,920
Yes yes

602
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,360
I've said all the good things

603
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:28,600
Begged him for half an hour

604
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,241
He handed me over to the chief anyway

605
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:33,281
People are asking you to turn over a new leaf

606
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:34,281
Be innocent

607
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,761
He won't let me go in the end

608
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:38,281
Wait outside the cell

609
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:40,640
I have to be an apprentice in a restaurant

610
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,801

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,640
What a nice man

614
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,721
Don't let him fool you

615
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:52,081
On this surface

616
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:53,440
A gentle scholar

617
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:55,241
The heart is so black and cruel

618
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:56,961
He took my wages

619
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,561
There must be a misunderstanding in this

620
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,840
What's the misunderstanding

621
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,281
I won't give him arsenic

622
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm already a good man

623
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,081

626
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,321
The wine from the Royal Wine Shop has arrived

627
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,200
You go check it

628
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:11,761

Yes yes

641
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,281
Move all this inside

You write it again

650
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,120
Almost

651
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,440
That's a big difference

652
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,400
You see

653
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:16,640
Be careful

654
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,521
There was an accident in the wine warehouse

655
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:30,801
Yao Ziliao was seriously injured and unconscious

656
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,041

657
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:39,680
What reason do I have to do this

658
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,961
You help me to the top

659
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,440
Just to control the food bureau

Although I don't know

661
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:44,561
Your real purpose

662
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:46,241
But in order to remove obstacles,

663
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:47,680
Nature can do whatever it takes

664
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,001
The eunuch who was caught

665
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,120
He is still being held in Gongzhengsi

666
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,321
What did he say

667
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,920
He insisted that it was an accident

668
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,840
Your opponent is injured

669
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:00,920
Shouldn't you be happy

670
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:03,880
I

671
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:21,920
Seasonal medicine

672
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,961
When will Zi Jin wake up

673
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:26,801
Your own injuries

674
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:27,680
I'm okay

675
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:30,400
What happened to her

676
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,281
When an accident occurs

677
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:34,481
It's a good thing you got in the way

678
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,360
Really hit the head

679
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,001
I'm afraid in this life

680
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:37,961
I can't wake up

681
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,281
Then her hand

682
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,281
Will there be hidden dangers in her hands

683
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,281
Meng Shang Shi

684
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:47,961
Yao Dianshan's Hand

685
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,081
Need careful aftercare

686
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:50,761
Specific circumstances

687
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:51,840
After she wakes up,

688
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,801
Re-judge

689
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,920
From now on

690
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:57,840
The rest of the people move out of here

691
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,561
Give her peace of mind to recuperate

692
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:09,160
Give her medicine first

693
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,360
Yes

694
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,721
Although drinking should be warm,

695
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:34,400
But you have to divide different wines

696
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,440
Different wines

697
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,400
Use different temperatures

698
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,481
Only in this way can we not lose the original taste

699
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:42,120
All I know is that cold wine hurts my stomach

700
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
Overheating and lung injury

701
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:45,001
Therefore, we can only use warm wine

702
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:47,241
But I don't know when to warm the wine

703
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,321
There is also a lot of knowledge

704
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:50,200
Why don't you come down to the temple and teach me

705
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,840
Good or not

706
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:16,400
Zi Jin

707
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:17,761
You're awake

708
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:20,001
Purple Azolla

709
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:30,081
My hand

710
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,840
Don't worry, son

711
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,160
Ji Dian's Theory of Medicine

712
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
You just have to have a good rest

713
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,120
It will be fine

714
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,561
You mustn't move your hand

715
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:37,281
It hurts

716
00:43:58,561 --> 00:43:59,360
Crown Princess

717
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:01,561
Your Highness drank wine

718
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Just say some headaches

719
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,880
Let's take a break first

720
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,041
What the hell is going on

721
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:06,521
Now that your highness has rested,

722
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:07,801
Handmaiden is later

723
00:44:07,801 --> 00:44:08,920
Then report the government affairs

724
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,761
Handmaiden leaves first
