1
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,359
Sweet bean pudding

2
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,920
How can bean curd be sweet

3
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,599
Back to your highness's words

4
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,199
It was prepared by the Food Bureau

5
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,199
How is bean curd sweet

6
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,239
Why is bean curd

7
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,119
Make it sweet

8
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,319
What the hell is in here

9
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
Back to your highness's words

10
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,319
It's inside

11
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,680
It's possible that it's sugar

12
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,520
Or syrup

13
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,959
It could also be sweet-scented osmanthus

14
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,680
I don't know the specific handmaiden either

15
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,000
How could anyone in this world

16
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
Put sugar in bean curd

17
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Your Highness doesn't know

18
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,880
My grandmother

19
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,839
It is a native of Jingzhou Prefecture

20
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,479
I made it for my minister since I was a child

21
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,520
This is the sweet tofu pudding

22
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,199
Especially sweet and delicious

23
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:54,560
This

24
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,959
But this is obviously a pot

25
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,079
How do you taste salty and sweet

26
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,119
It doesn't smell at all

27
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,479
The handmaiden saw it with his own eyes

28
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,199
That's a

29
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,280
A piece of copper that divides the pot into two

30
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,040
The copper sheet was smeared

31
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,160
Specific

32
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,839
After the handmaiden asked

33
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:11,880
Talk back and forth again

34
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,680
What nonsense

35
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,079
Tofu can only be salty

36
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,280
I've done the first favor

37
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,599
Why don't you just help me one more time

38
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,920
I've never heard you mention it before

39
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,839
You two

40
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,959
Did you meet me outside the palace

41
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
Then since I like him,

42
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,400
Why do you keep pushing me

43
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,280
I just became a palm meal.

44
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,479
Limited salary

45
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,959
Gold pearls and jade from my daughter's house

46
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,439
I don't even have a ropa khan towel

47
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,599
Those poems and words

48
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,359
I don't understand either

49
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,680
How to express affection

50
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:02,920
Only do one or two

51
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,079
A delicious meal

52
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,160
To the fullest of one's mind

53
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,400
Just help me this time

54
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,679
Haoziliao

55
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm begging you, son

56
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,239
Haoziliao

57
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,840
I am grateful to you all my life

58
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,520
Go, go, go, go

59
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,199
Purple Azolla

60
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,000
Go on

61
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,239
Let Shangshi Bureau in the future

62
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,560
No more sweet bean curd

63
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,399
Yes

64
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,760
Your Highness

65
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,800
This book

66
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,040
It seems that Lord Mei borrowed it

67
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,800
He forgot to take it

68
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,000
The handmaiden will send it now

69
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,040
Give it to me

70
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,159
A house full of sweet odors

71
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,879
Go out for relaxation

72
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,560
There is really someone

73
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,159
Love sweet bean curd

74
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,120
Lord Mei

75
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,639
Yao canon meal

76
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,439
This is the meal for you from the Shang Food Bureau

77
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,000
Thank you very much

78
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,239
Your Highness, what do you see me do

79
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,439
Where's the food box

80
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,959
What food box

81
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,719
That's not for your highness

82
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,280
Your Highness

83
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,959
This, this can't fall

84
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,159
You give me give me give me

85
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,040
Didn't your highness say it himself

86
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,439
No one is allowed to mention it again

87
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,080
Handmaiden naturally dare not disobey

88
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,679
You go and get twenty sticks

89
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,760
Your Highness Your Highness

90
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,719
That's the supply

91
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,919
Tea and rice for ministers entering the palace

92
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,320
It stands to reason

93
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,719
This deserves to be Guanglu Temple Office

94
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,199
But they fool errands all day long

95
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,840
Cook a meal

96
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,080
How bad it tastes

97
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,199
Guangluqing has just been reprimanded by your majesty

98
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,719
On the grounds of organizing the annual banquet,

99
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,639
Take this errand

100
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,600
It was pushed to the Shang Food Bureau

101
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:20,959
Really

102
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,679
It's absolutely true

103
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,919
I didn't say a word of redundancy

104
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,560
The food boxes are all

105
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,719
Pass it through my hand

106
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,320
Then why smile so happily

107
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,320
Accepted

108
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,439
Great, great

109
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,840
Now I can get revenge

110
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,840
Make way, make way, make way

111
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:04,959
You say it again

112
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,959
Fresh Meat Lantern Festival

113
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120

00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,000
Bamboo insect bee pupa grasshopper

115
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,320
Don't you look at me like that

116
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,199
Fried bee pupae is crisp and tender

117
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,479
Is it a top-grade delicacy

118
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,120
Yin Ziping

119
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,439
You are clearly

120
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,479
Deliberately bullying Lord Mei

121
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,959
Sachet sachet

122
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
Run slowly

123
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,560
Pain, pain, pain

124
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,479
Why did you steal

125
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,239
You let go of me

126
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,280
Don't learn well at a young age

127
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,520
Go with me to the yamen and let go

128
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,719
I didn't steal the money I didn't steal

129
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,879
You let go of me

130
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
You let go of me

131
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:08,919
What's going on

132
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,760
This man steals

133
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,120
Arrest it for me

134
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,959

I've said all the good things

136
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,639
Begged him for half an hour

137
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,280
He handed me over to the chief anyway

138
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
People are asking you to turn over a new leaf

139
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Be innocent

140
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,800
He won't let me go in the end

141
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
Wait outside the cell

142
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,679
I have to be an apprentice in a restaurant

143
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,840

What a nice man

147
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't let him fool you

148
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,120
On this surface

149
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,479
A gentle scholar

150
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,280
The heart is so black and cruel

151
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
He took my wages

152
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
There must be a misunderstanding in this

153
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,879
What's the misunderstanding

154
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,320
I won't give him arsenic

155
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,439
I'm already a good man

156
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:52,120

The wine from the Royal Wine Shop has arrived

160
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,239
You go check it

161
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,800

You write it again

183
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,159
Almost

184
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,479
That's a big difference

185
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:00,439
You see

186
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,679
Be careful

187
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,560
There was an accident in the wine warehouse

188

190
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,719
What reason do I have to do this

191
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,000
You help me to the top

192
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,479
Just to control the food bureau

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
Although I don't know

194
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
Your real purpose

195
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,280
But in order to remove obstacles,

196
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,719
Nature can do whatever it takes

197
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,040
The eunuch who was caught

198
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,159
He is still being held in Gongzhengsi

199
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,360
What did he say

200
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,959
He insisted that it was an accident

201
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:45,879
Your opponent is injured

202
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,959
Shouldn't you be happy

203
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,919
I

204
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,959
Seasonal medicine

205
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,000
When will Zi Jin wake up

206
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,840
Your own injuries

207
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,719
I'm okay

208
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,439
What happened to her

209
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,320
When an accident occurs

210
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,520
It's a good thing you got in the way

211
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,399
Really hit the head

212
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm afraid in this life

213
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,000
I can't wake up

214
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,320
Then her hand

215
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,320
Will there be hidden dangers in her hands

216
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,320
Meng Shang Shi

217
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000
Yao Dianshan's Hand

218
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,120
Need careful aftercare

219
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Specific circumstances

220
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,879
After she wakes up,

221
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:40,840
Re-judge

222
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:43,959
From now on

223
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,879
The rest of the people move out of here

224
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,600
Give her peace of mind to recuperate

225
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,199
Give her medicine first

226
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,399
Yes

227
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,760
Although drinking should be warm,

228
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,439
But you have to divide different wines

229
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:23,479
Different wines

230
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,439
Use different temperatures

231
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,520
Only in this way can we not lose the original taste

232
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,159
All I know is that cold wine hurts my stomach

233
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,159
Overheating and lung injury

234
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,040
Therefore, we can only use warm wine

235
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
But I don't know when to warm the wine

236
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,360
There is also a lot of knowledge

237
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,239
Why don't you come down to the temple and teach me

238
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:38,879
Good or not

239
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,439
Zi Jin

240
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,800
You're awake

241
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,040
Purple Azolla

242
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,120
My hand

243
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,879
Don't worry, son

244
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:21,199
Ji Dian's Theory of Medicine

245
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,199
You just have to have a good rest

246
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,159
It will be fine

247
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,600
You mustn't move your hand

248
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,320
It hurts

249
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,399
Crown Princess

250
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,600
Your Highness drank wine

251
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:50,879
Just say some headaches

252
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:51,919
Let's take a break first

253
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,080
What the hell is going on

254
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,560
Now that your highness has rested,

255
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,840
Handmaiden is later

256
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,959
Then report the government affairs

257
00:43:57,879 --> 00:43:58,800
Handmaiden leaves first
