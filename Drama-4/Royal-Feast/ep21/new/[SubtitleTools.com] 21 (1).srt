1
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,919
Your Highness

2
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,679
Do you think this will make me feel relieved

3
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,679
Events

4
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Your Highness, this turtle cream may be a little fishy

5
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,479
Do you want to use something else

6
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm very angry now

7
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,479
Don't you know I'm irritated

8
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,000
Take away

9
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,800
Yes

10
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
Add honey and sweet-scented osmanthus

11
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,839
Go quickly

12
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm going now

13
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,119
What's the matter? You're not feeling well

14
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
It's just a medicine for a woman to recuperate her body

15
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,839
Take it down

16
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,440
It's weird

17
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,679
How come Miaoxian is also drinking medicine. You are also drinking medicine

18
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,520
And you didn't hire a doctor

19
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,639
How

20
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
You wrote the prescription

21
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,959
I haven't seen anyone around you

22
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,720
The screen is too young

23
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,399
Mother is afraid that she can't afford it

24
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,359
So I specially chose

25
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,880
Four clever palace maidservants sent it

26
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,760
Empress Empress

27
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,079
This morning, the East Palace sent all the people back

28
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,119
It means Crown Princess

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Mother, this is the son's own meaning

30
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,399
Let's all go down

31
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,720
Yes

32
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
It doesn't matter if you don't like it

33
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,440
I'll send four more people tomorrow

34
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,640
Mother Queen

35
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,920
I don't mean to be harsh on you

36
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,519
If you are an ordinary person,

37
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
I will never interfere indiscriminately

38
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
But are you

39
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,040
You are the Prince of the East Palace

40
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,279
One country Chu Jun

41
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,359
If there are no children

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,839
Who will bear the heavy responsibility of Jiangshan in the future

43
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
The mother's son is still young

44
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,799
There will be children sooner or later

45
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Why are you in such a hurry

46
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,799
I can't bear

47
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,040
I don't bother to embarrass my daughter-in-law

48
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,079
But the whole world is waiting and watching

49
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,679
Looking forward to the birth of Daming's future heir

50
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,119
How about this

51
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
Those concubines in the East Palace

52
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,079
If you don't like it

53
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,760
Then choose again

54
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,279
Choose until you are satisfied

55
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,839
Mother, they are all very good

56
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
There is nothing dissatisfied with my son

57
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,720
They are all good

58
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,040
But none of them you like

59
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Mother, if you send someone over again

60
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,920
I will send it back as I am

61
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,399
Don't bother about this matter

62
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,160
My son retires

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,799
Zhan Ji

64
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,279
This is also your unshirkable responsibility

65
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,119
You come back here

66
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,160
Master

67
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,279
The child

68
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,559
How could he not understand

69
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
If I don't embarrass them today,

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
They will become sinners through the ages

71
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,399
As long as there are children,

72
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,040
They can no longer be blamed by the world

73
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,239
In order to really have a way to live

74
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
Empress's painstaking efforts

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,279
Your Highness has not yet realized

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
So what should we do now

77
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,239
Since he doesn't like all the people who send it,

78
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
Then pick one he likes

79
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,000
What are you doing now

80
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,679
Meng Shang Shi

81
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,920
His Royal Highness King Wei coughs late at night

82
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,760
I read that it was said in dietotherapy herbal medicine

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,399
Make 50 holes with one frozen pear

84
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,679
Fill with pepper

85
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,600
Then wrap the noodles in hot ash and simmer them until cooked

86
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,959
Remove pepper after cooling and eat it

87
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,239
Can relieve cough

88
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,959
So I want to give it a try

89
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,679
Remember when I told you

90
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,440
What is cooking

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
The so-called cooking

92
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,959
Is to fully consider the needs of diners

93
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,440
Try to preserve the original taste and essence of ingredients

94
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,079
And then make delicious food

95
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
Since I choose to specialize in medicated diet,

96
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,839
Remove from paying attention to the physique of the eater

97
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Choosing ingredients is particularly important

98
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,519
Let's talk about it

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,760
How did you choose the medicine pear

100
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,040
It is recorded in this sketch

101
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
Only the milk pears in Xuancheng

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,640
There are also pears in Jingzhou County and Beidu

103
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
It is suitable for medicine

104
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,960
But after a couple of trials

105
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,359
I found the perfume pears that were paid tribute this year

106
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,520
It also has excellent results

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,039
So this time it was taken out as medicine

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,840
It is good to know how to identify pharmacopoeia records

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,840
But what

110
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
The eaters are children

111
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,599
Pepper tastes too heavy

112
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,919
He won't like it

113
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,320
Why don't you switch to ghee and honey

114
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,320
And

115
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,119
Pear peel clears heart fire, promotes salivation and quenches thirst

116
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,239
It is a medicinal material in itself

117
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Wouldn't the medicine be greatly reduced if the pear skin was removed

118
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,039
You said earlier that you were not good at medicated diet

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
I almost believed it

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
As a kitchen

121
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,239
Always be aware of the characteristics of ingredients in the world

122
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,479
Know something

123
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,840
Understand

124
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,599
Xie Mengshang's index finger point

125
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
Zi Jin Zi Jin

126
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,159
Meng Shang Shi

127
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,320
Herald of Kunning Palace

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,719
Present the midnight snack fruit box with the food bureau

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
All that's left is these ripe taros

130
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,799
Betel nut taro is not the only good taro in China

131
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
The most delicate piedmont taro with taro meat

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,159
It is the best ingredient to make taro paste

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
What about sliced steamed meat

134
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,760
It has to be Fenghua Taro

135
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
This little taro

136
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,039
Make sweet-scented osmanthus sweet-scented taro seedlings and scallion oil taro

137
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,840
Isn't it just right

138
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
What about this one

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Lai Zi Jin

140
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,919
Come and help me

141
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:04,719
Yes

142
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,200
Meng Shangshi, please stay

143
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,239
Go ahead

144
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes

145
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,880
Empress doesn't often eat at night

146
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:44,320
Meng Shangshi only took cooked taro slices and nuts

147
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,599
Slightly fry almonds in sauce

148
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,359
Serve with parsley Bijian soup

149
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,320
It can strengthen spleen and stomach, tranquilize nerves and help sleep

150
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
Please treat the empress to dinner

151
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,119
Remember our stakes

152
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,880
Silly girl, why bother you

153
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,039
Who can fight the royal family

154
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,359
If this stalemate continues,

155
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,479
Who can save you in the world

156
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,599
Crown Princess

157
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,559
Crown princess calms her anger

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Wait for me to persuade slowly

159
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
She'll change her mind

160
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,159
The world is born as if it were in a cage

161
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,039
If you want to return to nature,

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,760
Unless it turns into a piece of loess

163
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,960
You haven't said a word for half a year

164
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,000
Facing this old window all day long

165
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,119
Do you really think

166
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,559
Can I be detached from this world

167
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,719
People who can replace you are like crucian carp crossing the river

168
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,520
It's just that I don't allow resistance

169
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
I don't allow anyone to say no to me

170
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,119
Crown Princess

171
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,239
Ali grew up with my own eyes

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,799
It's a courtesy

173
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,479
A good girl who knows the rules

174
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,679
Please look at my thin noodles

175
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
Give her another chance

176
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,479
Silly child

177
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,799
Refuse to enter the palace

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,039
There are only two roads left

179
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,280
Become a monk or die

180
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
You are so young

181
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,359
Do you really have to hinge your hair

182
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:50,719
Have you been with the ancient Buddha with green lanterns all your life

183
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,679
The Crown Princess forced me into the palace

184
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
You are not afraid of bringing disaster

185
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,000
Name has been determined

186
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,760
I advise you not to be wishful thinking

187
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Be your great grandwife honestly

188
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,919
But I'm not reconciled

189
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,359
Do you dare to gamble

190
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,039
When you know the prosperity of this supreme and expensive place,

191
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,400
I've seen my son again

192
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
All unwillingness will vanish

193
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:37,919
At that time

194
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,799
I'm waiting for you to beg me

195
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,359
Give you this grace

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
You have been in the palace for some time

197
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,919
Do you know what is the supreme place in the world

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,679
Back to the empress's words

199
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,080
The so-called royal family

200
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,760
Prosperity, splendor and supreme power

201
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,119
There is no one like me in the world

202
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
Have you ever seen the prince

203
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,359
His Royal Highness the Prince is wise and wise

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Smart decision

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
There is also a benevolence of loving the people and caring for the people

206
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,719
I will make a decree tomorrow

207
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,719
Make you a prince concubine

208
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,640
The handmaiden thanks the empress for her kindness

209
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,119
Please take back your life

210
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,039
What are you talking about

211
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Handmaiden's blessings are shallow

212
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,200
Shame and dare not accept it

213
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,479
Seeing Imperial Power and Not Admire Imperial Power

214
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,599
Know splendor and don't envy splendor

215
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,599
You are at ease

216
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,000
But between you and him

217
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,320
There is a predestined fate

218
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,520
Are you willing to cut it off together

219
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,479
Handmaiden

220
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
When I first entered the palace

221
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,200
Always have grievances in my heart

222
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,960
Can get along with your highness day and night

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,679
A cavity of ice and snow is also melted because of him

224
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,520
Empress

225
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,799
Handmaiden sincerely admires your highness

226
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,239
But affection and freedom must finally make a choice

227
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,520
Handmaiden is unwilling to be a princess

228
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,359
Please help the empress

229
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,840
Do you know what you're saying

230
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,080
The empress promised the handmaiden that she would let me go

231
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,960
How dare you speak so presumptuously in front of me

232
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
I am the ruler of this harem

233
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,320
As long as I don't let you go

234
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,039
You have to be deferential in this harem

235
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,359
Be your prince's wife

236
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,359
Spread children for the royal family

237
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
Handmaiden is naive and foolish

238
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,160
Unknown doctrine

239
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,319
Even more unworthy to serve your highness

240
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,280
How dare you say such a thing so boldly

241
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
No matter how hard your bones are

242
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,040
A knife and axe that is hard but sharp

243
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,560
Your will is firm again

244
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,800
Can't shake the supreme imperial power

245
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
The reason why you can talk to me like this

246
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,920
Is nothing more than taking advantage of my tolerance and compassion

247
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,680
When you run out of my last patience

248
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Your brother, you are the nine families of Sun Shi

249
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,520
It will overturn in an instant

250
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,839
The world says

251
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,040
Empress is gentle and lenient

252
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
But they are all wrong about you

253
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Your will is far more determined than any man

254
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,079
The decision is far from comparable to human beings

255
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,560
But

256
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,880
What the rest of the heart wants

257
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,959
Die nine times without regret

258
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,479
Handmaiden retires

259
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,959
Empress, this maid is so rude

260
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,439
You shouldn't forgive her any more

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,760
Sure enough, it is soft, waxy, sweet, crisp and delicious

262
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,000
When I was in trouble,

263
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,079
She can stand by and watch

264
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,280
But she put aside the past and ran for me

265
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,079
Mother is right

266
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,359
She's a good kid

267
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,319
Empress

268
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,160
I just want to see

269
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,719
Does anyone really dare to disobey the imperial power in this world

270
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,439
Even

271
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,359
Resist the arrangement of fate

272
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,920
Wait for me here

273
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,800
Elder sister invited each other late at night

274
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,199
What's so important

275
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,319
What is this

276
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,920
Subcharacter

277
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,040
Machamp Chaos I don't need it

278
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,640
If elder sister asked me to come here for this matter,

279
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,760
Then I'll go back first

280
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,040
The Crown Princess accepted it

281
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,119
I said I don't need

282
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
Elder sister

283
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,839
In fact, it doesn't matter whether you have children or not

284
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,640
My sister sincerely prayed to heaven

285
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,040
May you have peace and joy all your life

286
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
This wish is enough

287
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,439
Elder sister

288
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,599
Why do you keep saying such strange things tonight

289
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,560
Elder sister

290
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,560
Elder sister

291
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,199
Purple Azolla

292
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,760
Why are you stunned?

293
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,479
Why are you distracted

294
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,680
Nothing

295
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,119
It's really okay

296
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,800
But this tofu practices knife skills

297
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,599
I don't know how long I have to practice

298
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:26,800
What

299
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,239
Last time I saw Fang Dianshan making Vince tofu

300
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,359
Later, I heard that at the tofu banquet,

301
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,000
There are 158 tofu dishes

302
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,599
She was possessed

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,439
Facing that piece of tofu every day

304
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
I don't know what I'm doing

305
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:54,599
Come with me

306
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,560
Your Highness

307
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,640
Although your majesty has spared the golden beads of toes

308
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,839
Buying tea lessons in Shaanxi and Sichuan

309
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,680
However, there are still many places to buy and collect

310
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,760
Wasting people and money

311
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,959
For example, Dan lacquer azurite paid tribute every year

312
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,760
Regardless of whether it is produced locally

313
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,839
Collect it all

314
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
Forcing people to sell their property

315
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,640
Buy Dan lacquer azurite at a high price

316
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,079
To complete the apportionment of the government

317
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,479
Profiteers take the opportunity to drive up

318
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,079
As a result, prices have soared dozens of times

319
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,359
The people went bankrupt

320
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,719
Why did you stop me from writing

321
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,800
I don't think you are scolding profiteers

322
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,319
Are you scolding

323
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,400
Eunuchs sent by my father to buy everywhere

324
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,680
Do you know that

325
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,239
Those who my father sent

326
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,640
Most of them are people he values

327
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,400
Some are even confidants who have served for many years

328
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,239
Do you think Father believes in you or them

329
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,680
I can't let someone like you

330
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
Be victimized by slanderers

331
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
I am now a censor

332
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,599
It is the responsibility of supervising the departments to report illegal activities

333
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,599
You can't sit back and watch eunuchs become misfortunes

334
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a mess for me.

335
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:02,800
Your Highness, you should also be alert to the villains around you

336
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,439
Do not be fooled by them

337
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:35,880
Your Highness

338
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,719
Reward you

339
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,160
His Royal Highness

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,719
Good tea

341
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,839
Good tea. Good tea. Thank you, Your Highness

342
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,800
Gentle water moistens everything

343
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,800
Violent water destroys fields and hurts people

344
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
So people fix water trucks

345
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,479
Building dams to prevent floods in Xingyuan

346
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,079
Water is so

347
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,319
So do people

348
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,599
Eunuchs fought with Grandpa Huang for many years

349
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,400
There are indeed many talents around me

350
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,319
Sure enough, it is one

351
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,880
Honest and brave young talents

352
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,439
What

353
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,439
Go

354
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,400
This way this way

355
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,959
Come back

356
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,359
Why are you here

357
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,000
I came to see your sweetheart

358
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,560
Zheng Sanbao fought bravely and fought several times to the West

359
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,280
I also lost my ha and went to work as a slave for many times

360
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,119
Zhaofu local ethnic groups

361
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,280
Of course

362
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,959
There are also private news from the imperial court

363
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,479
Huang Yan who is plotting evil

364
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,599
Eunuch and Water

365
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,199
Even it is no different from officials

366
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,400
There is no distinction between good and evil

367
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,280
It just depends on how to use it

368
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,560
Your Highness is wrong

369
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,599
The sword is in the hand of the chivalrous man

370
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,199
You can be chivalrous

371
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,760
Fall into the hands of bandits and bandits

372
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,400
It is a weapon to kill people

373
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,959
Da Ming Guo Zuo concerns all people

374
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Today, the merciful prince is wise

375
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,319
Can hold this sharp blade firmly

376
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
But who can guarantee that

377
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,199
From generation to generation, there are saints and lords in Daming

378
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,319
Bold

379
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,079
Out

380
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,920
Out

381
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,640
Yes

382
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,359
You

383
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,640
Impeach Royal Guards again

384
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,599
Impeach the eunuchs again

385
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,119
How many time have I told you

386
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,359
What are the words in my heart

387
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,520
Just talk to me in private

388
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,599
You swear so openly

389
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
Be careful that someone behind you makes a cold arrow

390
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,199
Now that your highness knows it's a villain

391
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,079
Why do you stay around?

392
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,920
When I was young,

393
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
Yuan Qi waited on me

394
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,479
I accidentally fell off my horse once

395
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,479
He jumped at the guard

396
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,520
He was seriously injured and lay down for a year

397
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,319
Shaoyuan

398
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,800
Even if it is a villain of humble origin,

399
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,800
It is also flesh and blood

400
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
I'll prepare the meal

401
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,199
Isn't this too fragrant

402
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,119
Zi Jin

403
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,839
You said this stinky tofu

404
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,920
It smells so bad

405
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,520
Why does it taste so delicious

406
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:04,920
Fragrant bar

407
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,920
Zi Jin

408
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,040
The first piece is mine

409
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
You are not allowed to rob mine

410
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,119
My my mine

411
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,760
My mine my mine

412
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,000
Give me a bite, too

413
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,319
Eat slowly and be careful of scalding

414
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,239
Zi Jin

415
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,280
Run so fast just now

416
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,280
Ask you and you ignore me

417
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,719
What can I do now

418
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,599
I

419
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Have a quick taste

420
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,000
Meng Shang's food is coming

421
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,040
This year's Shangyuan Festival

422
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,839
Long live Aoshan lamp should be set up in the palace

423
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
Pray for peace in the world

424
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,280
Your Majesty will also reward officials with banquets

425
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,119
You all have to cheer up

426
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,319
Deal with it well

427
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,319
Yes

428
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,479
Meng Shang Shi

429
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
If I remember correctly

430
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,520
The competition between us

431
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,119
It hasn't been decided yet, has it

432
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Hu Shang Shi

433
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,160
It has come to this point

434
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,599
Aren't you willing to stop

435
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,800
No matter what, I am still eating

436
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,719
On Grade

437
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,199
Not yet

438
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,680
You are presumptuous in front of me

439
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,719
Is this still necessary now

440
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:31,959
Meng Shang Shi

441
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,640
You are already the master of the food bureau

442
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,400
But the competition is a competition after all

443
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,079
There is no tie between the winner and the loser

444
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,839
How to convince people

445
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
This third game

446
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
Are you willing to fight

447
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,400
What is a bet

448
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,640
On the Yuan Festival, a banquet was given to officials

449
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,839
Let's try this

450
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,760
If I win by luck

451
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,599
Meng Shangshi should be in front of the world

452
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,680
Admit yourself that you are inferior to others

453
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,680
If I lose

454
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,079
I asked myself to leave the palace

455
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,520
Never step into the Forbidden City again

456
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,640
How

457
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
As you wish

458
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:33,680
If she hadn't been

459
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
Crown Princess's own sister

460
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,959
Will she be allowed to linger for so long

461
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,920
Now bring disgrace to oneself

462
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,119
Meng Shangshi hasn't taken the opportunity yet

463
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,239
Get her out of the palace

464
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,079
Are you right, Zihao

465
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,439
Don't talk about it

466
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,640
Can you promise me two things

467
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,040
Two pieces

468
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,359
Sweet bean pudding

469
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,920
How can bean curd be sweet

470
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,599
Back to your highness's words

471
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,199
It was prepared by the Food Bureau

472
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,199
How is bean curd sweet

473
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,239
Why is bean curd

474
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,119
Make it sweet

475
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,319
What the hell is in here

476
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
Back to your highness's words

477
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,319
It's inside

478
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,680
It's possible that it's sugar

479
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,520
Or syrup

480
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,959
It could also be sweet-scented osmanthus

481
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,680
I don't know the specific handmaiden either

482
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,000
How could anyone in this world

483
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
Put sugar in bean curd

484
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Your Highness doesn't know

485
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,880
My grandmother

486
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,839
It is a native of Jingzhou Prefecture

487
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,479
I made it for my minister since I was a child

488
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,520
This is the sweet tofu pudding

489
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,199
Especially sweet and delicious

490
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:54,560
This

491
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,959
But this is obviously a pot

492
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,079
How do you taste salty and sweet

493
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,119
It doesn't smell at all

494
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,479
The handmaiden saw it with his own eyes

495
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,199
That's a

496
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,280
A piece of copper that divides the pot into two

497
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,040
The copper sheet was smeared

498
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,160
Specific

499
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,839
After the handmaiden asked

500
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:11,880
Talk back and forth again

501
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,680
What nonsense

502
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,079
Tofu can only be salty

503
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,280
I've done the first favor

504
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,599
Why don't you just help me one more time

505
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,920
I've never heard you mention it before

506
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,839
You two

507
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,959
Did you meet me outside the palace

508
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
Then since I like him,

509
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,400
Why do you keep pushing me

510
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,280
I just became a palm meal.

511
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,479
Limited salary

512
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,959
Gold pearls and jade from my daughter's house

513
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,439
I don't even have a ropa khan towel

514
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,599
Those poems and words

515
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,359
I don't understand either

516
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,680
How to express affection

517
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:02,920
Only do one or two

518
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,079
A delicious meal

519
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,160
To the fullest of one's mind

520
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,400
Just help me this time

521
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,679
Haoziliao

522
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm begging you, son

523
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,239
Haoziliao

524
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,840
I am grateful to you all my life

525
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,520
Go, go, go, go

526
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,199
Purple Azolla

527
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,000
Go on

528
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,239
Let Shangshi Bureau in the future

529
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,560
No more sweet bean curd

530
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,399
Yes

531
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,760
Your Highness

532
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,800
This book

533
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,040
It seems that Lord Mei borrowed it

534
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,800
He forgot to take it

535
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,000
The handmaiden will send it now

536
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,040
Give it to me

537
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,159
A house full of sweet odors

538
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,879
Go out for relaxation

539
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,560
There is really someone

540
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,159
Love sweet bean curd

541
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,120
Lord Mei

542
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,639
Yao canon meal

543
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,439
This is the meal for you from the Shang Food Bureau

544
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,000
Thank you very much

545
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,239
Your Highness, what do you see me do

546
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,439
Where's the food box

547
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,959
What food box

548
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,719
That's not for your highness

549
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,280
Your Highness

550
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,959
This, this can't fall

551
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,159
You give me give me give me

552
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,040
Didn't your highness say it himself

553
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,439
No one is allowed to mention it again

554
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,080
Handmaiden naturally dare not disobey

555
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,679
You go and get twenty sticks

556
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,760
Your Highness Your Highness

557
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,719
That's the supply

558
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,919
Tea and rice for ministers entering the palace

559
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,320
It stands to reason

560
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,719
This deserves to be Guanglu Temple Office

561
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,199
But they fool errands all day long

562
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,840
Cook a meal

563
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,080
How bad it tastes

564
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,199
Guangluqing has just been reprimanded by your majesty

565
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,719
On the grounds of organizing the annual banquet,

566
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,639
Take this errand

567
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,600
It was pushed to the Shang Food Bureau

568
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:20,959
Really

569
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,679
It's absolutely true

570
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,919
I didn't say a word of redundancy

571
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,560
The food boxes are all

572
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,719
Pass it through my hand

573
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,320
Then why smile so happily

574
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,320
Accepted

575
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,439
Great, great

576
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,840
Now I can get revenge

577
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,840
Make way, make way, make way

578
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:04,959
You say it again

579
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,959
Fresh Meat Lantern Festival

580
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120

00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,000
Bamboo insect bee pupa grasshopper

582
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,320
Don't you look at me like that

583
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,199
Fried bee pupae is crisp and tender

584
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,479
Is it a top-grade delicacy

585
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,120
Yin Ziping

586
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,439
You are clearly

587
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,479
Deliberately bullying Lord Mei

588
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,959
Sachet sachet

589
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
Run slowly

590
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,560
Pain, pain, pain

591
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,479
Why did you steal

592
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,239
You let go of me

593
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,280
Don't learn well at a young age

594
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,520
Go with me to the yamen and let go

595
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,719
I didn't steal the money I didn't steal

596
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,879
You let go of me

597
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
You let go of me

598
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:08,919
What's going on

599
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,760
This man steals

600
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,120
Arrest it for me

601
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,959
Yes yes

602
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,399
I've said all the good things

603
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,639
Begged him for half an hour

604
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,280
He handed me over to the chief anyway

605
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
People are asking you to turn over a new leaf

606
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Be innocent

607
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,800
He won't let me go in the end

608
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
Wait outside the cell

609
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,679
I have to be an apprentice in a restaurant

610
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,840
Restaurant apprentices need guarantors

611
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,239
He is personally surety for you

612
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,639
Force you to earn your own living

613
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,679
What a nice man

614
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't let him fool you

615
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,120
On this surface

616
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,479
A gentle scholar

617
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,280
The heart is so black and cruel

618
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
He took my wages

619
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
There must be a misunderstanding in this

620
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,879
What's the misunderstanding

621
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,320
I won't give him arsenic

622
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,439
I'm already a good man

623
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:52,120
Yin Ziping

624
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,399
Zi Jin

625
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:55,760
Zi Jin

626
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,360
The wine from the Royal Wine Shop has arrived

627
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,239
You go check it

628
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,800
Yes

629
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,159
Purple Azolla

630
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,159
Why don't you help, too

631
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,320

632
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,159

In

635
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,600
Let them all move in

636
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,399
Yes

637
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,040
Move quickly

638
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,879
Yes yes

639
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,159
Be gentle

640
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,840
Han Tan Chun Wu Wei Tang

641
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,320
Move all this inside

642
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:32,120
Be careful

643
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,360
Lotus and sweet-scented osmanthus brew

644
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:34,959
Chrysanthemum pulp and orchid drink are two barrels each

645
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:35,639
Slow down

646
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:37,520
Let me see

647
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,760
The Jubilee of Taixi White

648
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:50,800
Write like this

649
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:52,800
You write it again

650
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,159
Almost

651
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,479
That's a big difference

652
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:00,439
You see

653
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,679
Be careful

654
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,560
There was an accident in the wine warehouse

655
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
Yao Ziliao was seriously injured and unconscious

656
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,080
Did you do it

657
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,719
What reason do I have to do this

658
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,000
You help me to the top

659
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,479
Just to control the food bureau

660
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
Although I don't know

661
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
Your real purpose

662
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,280
But in order to remove obstacles,

663
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,719
Nature can do whatever it takes

664
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,040
The eunuch who was caught

665
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,159
He is still being held in Gongzhengsi

666
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,360
What did he say

667
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,959
He insisted that it was an accident

668
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:45,879
Your opponent is injured

669
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,959
Shouldn't you be happy

670
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,919
I

671
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,959
Seasonal medicine

672
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,000
When will Zi Jin wake up

673
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,840
Your own injuries

674
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,719
I'm okay

675
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,439
What happened to her

676
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,320
When an accident occurs

677
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,520
It's a good thing you got in the way

678
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,399
Really hit the head

679
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm afraid in this life

680
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,000
I can't wake up

681
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,320
Then her hand

682
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,320
Will there be hidden dangers in her hands

683
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,320
Meng Shang Shi

684
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000
Yao Dianshan's Hand

685
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,120
Need careful aftercare

686
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Specific circumstances

687
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,879
After she wakes up,

688
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:40,840
Re-judge

689
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:43,959
From now on

690
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,879
The rest of the people move out of here

691
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,600
Give her peace of mind to recuperate

692
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,199
Give her medicine first

693
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,399
Yes

694
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,760
Although drinking should be warm,

695
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,439
But you have to divide different wines

696
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:23,479
Different wines

697
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,439
Use different temperatures

698
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,520
Only in this way can we not lose the original taste

699
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,159
All I know is that cold wine hurts my stomach

700
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,159
Overheating and lung injury

701
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,040
Therefore, we can only use warm wine

702
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
But I don't know when to warm the wine

703
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,360
There is also a lot of knowledge

704
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,239
Why don't you come down to the temple and teach me

705
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:38,879
Good or not

706
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,439
Zi Jin

707
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,800
You're awake

708
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,040
Purple Azolla

709
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,120
My hand

710
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,879
Don't worry, son

711
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:21,199
Ji Dian's Theory of Medicine

712
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,199
You just have to have a good rest

713
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,159
It will be fine

714
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,600
You mustn't move your hand

715
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,320
It hurts

716
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,399
Crown Princess

717
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,600
Your Highness drank wine

718
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:50,879
Just say some headaches

719
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:51,919
Let's take a break first

720
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,080
What the hell is going on

721
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,560
Now that your highness has rested,

722
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,840
Handmaiden is later

723
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,959
Then report the government affairs

724
00:43:57,879 --> 00:43:58,800
Handmaiden leaves first
