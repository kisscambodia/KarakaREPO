1
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,919
Your Highness

2
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,679
Do you think this will make me feel relieved

3
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,679
Events

4
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Your Highness, this turtle cream may be a little fishy

5
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,479
Do you want to use something else

6
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm very angry now

7
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,479
Don't you know I'm irritated

8
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,000
Take away

9
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,800
Yes

10
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
Add honey and sweet-scented osmanthus

11
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,839
Go quickly

12
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm going now

13
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,119
What's the matter? You're not feeling well

14
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
It's just a medicine for a woman to recuperate her body

15
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,839
Take it down

16
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,440
It's weird

17
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,679
How come Miaoxian is also drinking medicine. You are also drinking medicine

18
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,520
And you didn't hire a doctor

19
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,639
How

20
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
You wrote the prescription

21
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,959
I haven't seen anyone around you

22
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,720
The screen is too young

23
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,399
Mother is afraid that she can't afford it

24
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,359
So I specially chose

25
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,880
Four clever palace maidservants sent it

26
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,760
Empress Empress

27
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,079
This morning, the East Palace sent all the people back

28
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,119
It means Crown Princess

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Mother, this is the son's own meaning

30
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,399
Let's all go down

31
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,720
Yes

32
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
It doesn't matter if you don't like it

33
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,440
I'll send four more people tomorrow

34
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,640
Mother Queen

35
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,920
I don't mean to be harsh on you

36
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,519
If you are an ordinary person,

37
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
I will never interfere indiscriminately

38
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
But are you

39
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,040
You are the Prince of the East Palace

40
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,279
One country Chu Jun

41
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,359
If there are no children

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,839
Who will bear the heavy responsibility of Jiangshan in the future

43
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
The mother's son is still young

44
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,799
There will be children sooner or later

45
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Why are you in such a hurry

46
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,799
I can't bear

47
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,040
I don't bother to embarrass my daughter-in-law

48
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,079
But the whole world is waiting and watching

49
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,679
Looking forward to the birth of Daming's future heir

50
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,119
How about this

51
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
Those concubines in the East Palace

52
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,079
If you don't like it

53
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,760
Then choose again

54
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,279
Choose until you are satisfied

55
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,839
Mother, they are all very good

56
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
There is nothing dissatisfied with my son

57
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,720
They are all good

58
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,040
But none of them you like

59
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Mother, if you send someone over again

60
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,920
I will send it back as I am

61
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,399
Don't bother about this matter

62
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,160
My son retires

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,799
Zhan Ji

64
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,279
This is also your unshirkable responsibility

65
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,119
You come back here

66
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,160
Master

67
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,279
The child

68
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,559
How could he not understand

69
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
If I don't embarrass them today,

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
They will become sinners through the ages

71
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,399
As long as there are children,

72
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,040
They can no longer be blamed by the world

73
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,239
In order to really have a way to live

74
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
Empress's painstaking efforts

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,279
Your Highness has not yet realized

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
So what should we do now

77
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,239
Since he doesn't like all the people who send it,

78
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
Then pick one he likes

79
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,000
What are you doing now

80
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,679
Meng Shang Shi

81
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,920
His Royal Highness King Wei coughs late at night

82
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,760
I read that it was said in dietotherapy herbal medicine

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,399
Make 50 holes with one frozen pear

84
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,679
Fill with pepper

85
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,600
Then wrap the noodles in hot ash and simmer them until cooked

86
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,959
Remove pepper after cooling and eat it

87
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,239
Can relieve cough

88
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,959
So I want to give it a try

89
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,679
Remember when I told you

90
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,440
What is cooking

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
The so-called cooking

92
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,959
Is to fully consider the needs of diners

93
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,440
Try to preserve the original taste and essence of ingredients

94
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,079
And then make delicious food

95
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
Since I choose to specialize in medicated diet,

96
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,839
Remove from paying attention to the physique of the eater

97
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Choosing ingredients is particularly important

98
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,519
Let's talk about it

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,760
How did you choose the medicine pear

100
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,040
It is recorded in this sketch

101
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
Only the milk pears in Xuancheng

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,640
There are also pears in Jingzhou County and Beidu

103
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
It is suitable for medicine

104
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,960
But after a couple of trials

105
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,359
I found the perfume pears that were paid tribute this year

106
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,520
It also has excellent results

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,039
So this time it was taken out as medicine

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,840
It is good to know how to identify pharmacopoeia records

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,840
But what

110
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
The eaters are children

111
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,599
Pepper tastes too heavy

112
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,919
He won't like it

113
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,320
Why don't you switch to ghee and honey

114
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,320
And

115
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,119
Pear peel clears heart fire, promotes salivation and quenches thirst

116
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,239
It is a medicinal material in itself

117
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Wouldn't the medicine be greatly reduced if the pear skin was removed

118
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,039
You said earlier that you were not good at medicated diet

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
I almost believed it

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
As a kitchen

121
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,239
Always be aware of the characteristics of ingredients in the world

122
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,479
Know something

123
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,840
Understand

124
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,599
Xie Mengshang's index finger point

125
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
Zi Jin Zi Jin

126
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,159
Meng Shang Shi

127
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,320
Herald of Kunning Palace

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,719
Present the midnight snack fruit box with the food bureau

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
All that's left is these ripe taros

130
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,799
Betel nut taro is not the only good taro in China

131
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
The most delicate piedmont taro with taro meat

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,159
It is the best ingredient to make taro paste

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
What about sliced steamed meat

134
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,760
It has to be Fenghua Taro

135
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
This little taro

136
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,039
Make sweet-scented osmanthus sweet-scented taro seedlings and scallion oil taro

137
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,840
Isn't it just right

138
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
What about this one

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Lai Zi Jin

140
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,919
Come and help me

141
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:04,719
Yes

142
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,200
Meng Shangshi, please stay

143
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,239
Go ahead

144
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes

145
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,880
Empress doesn't often eat at night

146
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:44,320
Meng Shangshi only took cooked taro slices and nuts

147
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,599
Slightly fry almonds in sauce

148
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,359
Serve with parsley Bijian soup

149
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,320
It can strengthen spleen and stomach, tranquilize nerves and help sleep

150
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
Please treat the empress to dinner

151
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,119
Remember our stakes

152
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,880
Silly girl, why bother you

153
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,039
Who can fight the royal family

154
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,359
If this stalemate continues,

155
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,479
Who can save you in the world

156
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,599
Crown Princess

157
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,559
Crown princess calms her anger

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Wait for me to persuade slowly

159
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
She'll change her mind

160
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,159
The world is born as if it were in a cage

161
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,039
If you want to return to nature,

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,760
Unless it turns into a piece of loess

163
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,960
You haven't said a word for half a year

164
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,000
Facing this old window all day long

165
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,119
Do you really think

166
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,559
Can I be detached from this world

167
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,719
People who can replace you are like crucian carp crossing the river

168
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,520
It's just that I don't allow resistance

169
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
I don't allow anyone to say no to me

170
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,119
Crown Princess

171
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,239
Ali grew up with my own eyes

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,799
It's a courtesy

173
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,479
A good girl who knows the rules

174
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,679
Please look at my thin noodles

175
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
Give her another chance

176
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,479
Silly child

177
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,799
Refuse to enter the palace

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,039
There are only two roads left

179
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,280
Become a monk or die

180
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
You are so young

181
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,359
Do you really have to hinge your hair

182
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:50,719
Have you been with the ancient Buddha with green lanterns all your life

183
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,679
The Crown Princess forced me into the palace

184
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
You are not afraid of bringing disaster

185
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,000
Name has been determined

186
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,760
I advise you not to be wishful thinking

187
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Be your great grandwife honestly

188
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,919
But I'm not reconciled

189
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,359
Do you dare to gamble

190
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,039
When you know the prosperity of this supreme and expensive place,

191
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,400
I've seen my son again

192
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
All unwillingness will vanish

193
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:37,919
At that time

194
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,799
I'm waiting for you to beg me

195
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,359
Give you this grace

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
You have been in the palace for some time

197
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,919
Do you know what is the supreme place in the world

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,679
Back to the empress's words

199
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,080
The so-called royal family

200
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,760
Prosperity, splendor and supreme power

201
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,119
There is no one like me in the world

202
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
Have you ever seen the prince

203
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,359
His Royal Highness the Prince is wise and wise

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Smart decision

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
There is also a benevolence of loving the people and caring for the people

206
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,719
I will make a decree tomorrow

207
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,719
Make you a prince concubine

208
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,640
The handmaiden thanks the empress for her kindness

209
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,119
Please take back your life

210
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,039
What are you talking about

211
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Handmaiden's blessings are shallow

212
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,200
Shame and dare not accept it

213
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,479
Seeing Imperial Power and Not Admire Imperial Power

214
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,599
Know splendor and don't envy splendor

215
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,599
You are at ease

216
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,000
But between you and him

217
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,320
There is a predestined fate

218
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,520
Are you willing to cut it off together

219
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,479
Handmaiden

220
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
When I first entered the palace

221
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,200
Always have grievances in my heart

222
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,960
Can get along with your highness day and night

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,679
A cavity of ice and snow is also melted because of him

224
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,520
Empress

225
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,799
Handmaiden sincerely admires your highness

226
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,239
But affection and freedom must finally make a choice

227
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,520
Handmaiden is unwilling to be a princess

228
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,359
Please help the empress

229
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,840
Do you know what you're saying

230
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,080
The empress promised the handmaiden that she would let me go

231
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,960
How dare you speak so presumptuously in front of me

232
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
I am the ruler of this harem

233
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,320
As long as I don't let you go

234
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,039
You have to be deferential in this harem

235
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,359
Be your prince's wife

236
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,359
Spread children for the royal family

237
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
Handmaiden is naive and foolish

238
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,160
Unknown doctrine

239
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,319
Even more unworthy to serve your highness

240
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,280
How dare you say such a thing so boldly

241
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
No matter how hard your bones are

242
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,040
A knife and axe that is hard but sharp

243
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,560
Your will is firm again

244
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,800
Can't shake the supreme imperial power

245
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
The reason why you can talk to me like this

246
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,920
Is nothing more than taking advantage of my tolerance and compassion

247
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,680
When you run out of my last patience

248
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Your brother, you are the nine families of Sun Shi

249
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,520
It will overturn in an instant

250
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,839
The world says

251
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,040
Empress is gentle and lenient

252
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
But they are all wrong about you

253
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Your will is far more determined than any man

254
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,079
The decision is far from comparable to human beings

255
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,560
But

256
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,880
What the rest of the heart wants

257
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,959
Die nine times without regret

258
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,479
Handmaiden retires

259
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,959
Empress, this maid is so rude

260
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,439
You shouldn't forgive her any more

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,760
Sure enough, it is soft, waxy, sweet, crisp and delicious

262
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,000
When I was in trouble,

263
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,079
She can stand by and watch

264
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,280
But she put aside the past and ran for me

265
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,079
Mother is right

266
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,359
She's a good kid

267
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,319
Empress

268
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,160
I just want to see

269
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,719
Does anyone really dare to disobey the imperial power in this world

270
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,439
Even

271
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,359
Resist the arrangement of fate

272
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,920
Wait for me here

273
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,800
Elder sister invited each other late at night

274
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,199
What's so important

275
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,319
What is this

276
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,920
Subcharacter

277
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,040
Machamp Chaos I don't need it

278
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,640
If elder sister asked me to come here for this matter,

279
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,760
Then I'll go back first

280
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,040
The Crown Princess accepted it

281
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,119
I said I don't need

282
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
Elder sister

283
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,839
In fact, it doesn't matter whether you have children or not

284
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,640
My sister sincerely prayed to heaven

285
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,040
May you have peace and joy all your life

286
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
This wish is enough

287
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,439
Elder sister

288
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,599
Why do you keep saying such strange things tonight

289
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,560
Elder sister

290
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,560
Elder sister

291
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,199
Purple Azolla

292
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,760
Why are you stunned?

293
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,479
Why are you distracted

294
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,680
Nothing

295
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,119
It's really okay

296
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,800
But this tofu practices knife skills

297
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,599
I don't know how long I have to practice

298
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:26,800
What

299
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,239
Last time I saw Fang Dianshan making Vince tofu

300
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,359
Later, I heard that at the tofu banquet,

301
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,000
There are 158 tofu dishes

302
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,599
She was possessed

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,439
Facing that piece of tofu every day

304
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
I don't know what I'm doing

305
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:54,599
Come with me

306
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,560
Your Highness

307
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,640
Although your majesty has spared the golden beads of toes

308
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,839
Buying tea lessons in Shaanxi and Sichuan

309
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,680
However, there are still many places to buy and collect

310
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,760
Wasting people and money

311
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,959
For example, Dan lacquer azurite paid tribute every year

312
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,760
Regardless of whether it is produced locally

313
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,839
Collect it all

314
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
Forcing people to sell their property

315
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,640
Buy Dan lacquer azurite at a high price

316
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,079
To complete the apportionment of the government

317
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,479
Profiteers take the opportunity to drive up

318
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,079
As a result, prices have soared dozens of times

319
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,359
The people went bankrupt

320
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,719
Why did you stop me from writing

321
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,800
I don't think you are scolding profiteers

322
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,319
Are you scolding

323
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,400
Eunuchs sent by my father to buy everywhere

324
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,680
Do you know that

325
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,239
Those who my father sent

326
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,640
Most of them are people he values

327
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,400
Some are even confidants who have served for many years

328
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,239
Do you think Father believes in you or them

329
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,680
I can't let someone like you

330
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
Be victimized by slanderers

331
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
I am now a censor

332
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,599
It is the responsibility of supervising the departments to report illegal activities

333
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,599
You can't sit back and watch eunuchs become misfortunes

334
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a mess for me.

335
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:02,800
Your Highness, you should also be alert to the villains around you

336
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,439
Do not be fooled by them

337
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:35,880
Your Highness

338
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,719
Reward you

339
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,160
His Royal Highness

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,719
Good tea

341
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,839
Good tea. Good tea. Thank you, Your Highness

342
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,800
Gentle water moistens everything

343
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,800
Violent water destroys fields and hurts people

344
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
So people fix water trucks

345
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,479
Building dams to prevent floods in Xingyuan

346
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,079
Water is so

347
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,319
So do people

348
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,599
Eunuchs fought with Grandpa Huang for many years

349
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,400
There are indeed many talents around me

350
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,319
Sure enough, it is one

351
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,880
Honest and brave young talents

352
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,439
What

353
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,439
Go

354
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,400
This way this way

355
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,959
Come back

356
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,359
Why are you here

357
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,000
I came to see your sweetheart

358
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,560
Zheng Sanbao fought bravely and fought several times to the West

359
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,280
I also lost my ha and went to work as a slave for many times

360
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,119
Zhaofu local ethnic groups

361
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,280
Of course

362
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,959
There are also private news from the imperial court

363
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,479
Huang Yan who is plotting evil

364
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,599
Eunuch and Water

365
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,199
Even it is no different from officials

366
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,400
There is no distinction between good and evil

367
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,280
It just depends on how to use it

368
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,560
Your Highness is wrong

369
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,599
The sword is in the hand of the chivalrous man

370
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,199
You can be chivalrous

371
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,760
Fall into the hands of bandits and bandits

372
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,400
It is a weapon to kill people

373
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,959
Da Ming Guo Zuo concerns all people

374
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Today, the merciful prince is wise

375
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,319
Can hold this sharp blade firmly

376
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
But who can guarantee that

377
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,199
From generation to generation, there are saints and lords in Daming

378
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,319
Bold

379
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,079
Out

380
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,920
Out

381
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,640
Yes

382
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,359
You

383
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,640
Impeach Royal Guards again

384
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,599
Impeach the eunuchs again

385
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,119
How many time have I told you

386
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,359
What are the words in my heart

387
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,520
Just talk to me in private

388
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,599
You swear so openly

389
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
Be careful that someone behind you makes a cold arrow

390
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,199
Now that your highness knows it's a villain

391
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,079
Why do you stay around?

392
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,920
When I was young,

393
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
Yuan Qi waited on me

394
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,479
I accidentally fell off my horse once

395
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,479
He jumped at the guard

396
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,520
He was seriously injured and lay down for a year

397
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,319
Shaoyuan

398
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,800
Even if it is a villain of humble origin,

399
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,800
It is also flesh and blood

400
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
I'll prepare the meal

401
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,199
Isn't this too fragrant

402
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,119
Zi Jin

403
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,839
You said this stinky tofu

404
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,920
It smells so bad

405
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,520
Why does it taste so delicious

406
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:04,920
Fragrant bar

407
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,920
Zi Jin

408
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,040
The first piece is mine

409
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
You are not allowed to rob mine

410
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,119
My my mine

411
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,760
My mine my mine

412
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,000
Give me a bite, too

413
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,319
Eat slowly and be careful of scalding

414
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,239
Zi Jin

415
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,280
Run so fast just now

416
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,280
Ask you and you ignore me

417
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,719
What can I do now

418
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,599
I

419
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Have a quick taste

420
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,000
Meng Shang's food is coming

421
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,040
This year's Shangyuan Festival

422
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,839
Long live Aoshan lamp should be set up in the palace

423
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
Pray for peace in the world

424
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,280
Your Majesty will also reward officials with banquets

425
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,119
You all have to cheer up

426
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,319
Deal with it well

427
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,319
Yes

428
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,479
Meng Shang Shi

429
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
If I remember correctly

430
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,520
The competition between us

431
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,119
It hasn't been decided yet, has it

432
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Hu Shang Shi

433
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,160
It has come to this point

434
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,599
Aren't you willing to stop

435
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,800
No matter what, I am still eating

436
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,719
On Grade

437
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,199
Not yet

438
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,680
You are presumptuous in front of me

439
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,719
Is this still necessary now

440
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:31,959
Meng Shang Shi

441
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,640
You are already the master of the food bureau

442
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,400
But the competition is a competition after all

443
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,079
There is no tie between the winner and the loser

444
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,839
How to convince people

445
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
This third game

446
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
Are you willing to fight

447
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,400
What is a bet

448
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,640
On the Yuan Festival, a banquet was given to officials

449
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,839
Let's try this

450
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,760
If I win by luck

451
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,599
Meng Shangshi should be in front of the world

452
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,680
Admit yourself that you are inferior to others

453
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,680
If I lose

454
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,079
I asked myself to leave the palace

455
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,520
Never step into the Forbidden City again

456
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,640
How

457
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
As you wish

458
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:33,680
If she hadn't been

459
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
Crown Princess's own sister

460
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,959
Will she be allowed to linger for so long

461
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,920
Now bring disgrace to oneself

462
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,119
Meng Shangshi hasn't taken the opportunity yet

463
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,239
Get her out of the palace

464
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,079
Are you right, Zihao

465
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,439
Don't talk about it

466
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,640
Can you promise me two things

467
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,040
Two pieces
