1
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,119
Your Highness

2
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,879
Do you think this will make me feel relieved

3
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,879
Events

4
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,720
Your Highness, this turtle cream may be a little fishy

5
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,679
Do you want to use something else

6
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm very angry now

7
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,679
Don't you know I'm irritated

8
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,200
Take away

9
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes

10
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,039
Add honey and sweet-scented osmanthus

11
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,039
Go quickly

12
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,280
I'm going now

13
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,319
What's the matter? You're not feeling well

14
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
It's just a medicine for a woman to recuperate her body

15
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,039
Take it down

16
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,640
It's weird

17
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,879
How come Miaoxian is also drinking medicine. You are also drinking medicine

18
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,720
And you didn't hire a doctor

19
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,839
How

20
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,240
You wrote the prescription

21
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,159
I haven't seen anyone around you

22
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,920
The screen is too young

23
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,599
Mother is afraid that she can't afford it

24
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,559
So I specially chose

25
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,080
Four clever palace maidservants sent it

26
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,960
Empress Empress

27
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,279
This morning, the East Palace sent all the people back

28
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,319
It means Crown Princess

29
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Mother, this is the son's own meaning

30
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,599
Let's all go down

31
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,920
Yes

32
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,240
It doesn't matter if you don't like it

33
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,640
I'll send four more people tomorrow

34
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:06,840
Mother Queen

35
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,120
I don't mean to be harsh on you

36
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,719
If you are an ordinary person,

37
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
I will never interfere indiscriminately

38
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,680
But are you

39
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,240
You are the Prince of the East Palace

40
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,479
One country Chu Jun

41
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,559
If there are no children

42
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,039
Who will bear the heavy responsibility of Jiangshan in the future

43
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,200
The mother's son is still young

44
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,999
There will be children sooner or later

45
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,920
Why are you in such a hurry

46
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,999
I can't bear

47
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,240
I don't bother to embarrass my daughter-in-law

48
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,279
But the whole world is waiting and watching

49
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,879
Looking forward to the birth of Daming's future heir

50
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:44,319
How about this

51
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,200
Those concubines in the East Palace

52
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,279
If you don't like it

53
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:50,960
Then choose again

54
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,479
Choose until you are satisfied

55
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,039
Mother, they are all very good

56
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,680
There is nothing dissatisfied with my son

57
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,920
They are all good

58
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,240
But none of them you like

59
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,120
Mother, if you send someone over again

60
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,120
I will send it back as I am

61
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,599
Don't bother about this matter

62
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,360
My son retires

63
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,999
Zhan Ji

64
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,479
This is also your unshirkable responsibility

65
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,319
You come back here

66
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,360
Master

67
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:25,479
The child

68
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,759
How could he not understand

69
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,960
If I don't embarrass them today,

70
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,240
They will become sinners through the ages

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,599
As long as there are children,

72
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,240
They can no longer be blamed by the world

73
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,439
In order to really have a way to live

74
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,920
Empress's painstaking efforts

75
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,479
Your Highness has not yet realized

76
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,400
So what should we do now

77
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,439
Since he doesn't like all the people who send it,

78
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,640
Then pick one he likes

79
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,200
What are you doing now

80
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,879
Meng Shang Shi

81
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,120
His Royal Highness King Wei coughs late at night

82
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,960
I read that it was said in dietotherapy herbal medicine

83
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,599
Make 50 holes with one frozen pear

84
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,879
Fill with pepper

85
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,800
Then wrap the noodles in hot ash and simmer them until cooked

86
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,159
Remove pepper after cooling and eat it

87
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,439
Can relieve cough

88
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,159
So I want to give it a try

89
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,879
Remember when I told you

90
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,640
What is cooking

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
The so-called cooking

92
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,159
Is to fully consider the needs of diners

93
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,640
Try to preserve the original taste and essence of ingredients

94
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,279
And then make delicious food

95
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,640
Since I choose to specialize in medicated diet,

96
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,039
Remove from paying attention to the physique of the eater

97
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Choosing ingredients is particularly important

98
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,719
Let's talk about it

99
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,960
How did you choose the medicine pear

100
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,240
It is recorded in this sketch

101
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,400
Only the milk pears in Xuancheng

102
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,840
There are also pears in Jingzhou County and Beidu

103
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,920
It is suitable for medicine

104
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,160
But after a couple of trials

105
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,559
I found the perfume pears that were paid tribute this year

106
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,720
It also has excellent results

107
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,239
So this time it was taken out as medicine

108
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,040
It is good to know how to identify pharmacopoeia records

109
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,040
But what

110
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,400
The eaters are children

111
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,799
Pepper tastes too heavy

112
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,119
He won't like it

113
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,520
Why don't you switch to ghee and honey

114
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,520
And

115
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,319
Pear peel clears heart fire, promotes salivation and quenches thirst

116
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,439
It is a medicinal material in itself

117
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Wouldn't the medicine be greatly reduced if the pear skin was removed

118
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,239
You said earlier that you were not good at medicated diet

119
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,520
I almost believed it

120
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
As a kitchen

121
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,439
Always be aware of the characteristics of ingredients in the world

122
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:53,679
Know something

123
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,040
Understand

124
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,799
Xie Mengshang's index finger point

125
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
Zi Jin Zi Jin

126
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,359
Meng Shang Shi

127
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,520
Herald of Kunning Palace

128
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,919
Present the midnight snack fruit box with the food bureau

129
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,520
All that's left is these ripe taros

130
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,999
Betel nut taro is not the only good taro in China

131
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,200
The most delicate piedmont taro with taro meat

132
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,359
It is the best ingredient to make taro paste

133
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,160
What about sliced steamed meat

134
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
It has to be Fenghua Taro

135
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
This little taro

136
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,239
Make sweet-scented osmanthus sweet-scented taro seedlings and scallion oil taro

137
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,040
Isn't it just right

138
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,200
What about this one

139
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,600
Lai Zi Jin

140
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,119
Come and help me

141
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:47,919
Yes

142
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,400
Meng Shangshi, please stay

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,439
Go ahead

144
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,640
Yes

145
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,080
Empress doesn't often eat at night

146
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,520
Meng Shangshi only took cooked taro slices and nuts

147
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,799
Slightly fry almonds in sauce

148
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,559
Serve with parsley Bijian soup

149
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,520
It can strengthen spleen and stomach, tranquilize nerves and help sleep

150
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,160
Please treat the empress to dinner

151
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,319
Remember our stakes

152
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,080
Silly girl, why bother you

153
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,239
Who can fight the royal family

154
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,559
If this stalemate continues,

155
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,679
Who can save you in the world

156
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,799
Crown Princess

157
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,759
Crown princess calms her anger

158
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Wait for me to persuade slowly

159
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,720
She'll change her mind

160
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:24,359
The world is born as if it were in a cage

161
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,239
If you want to return to nature,

162
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,960
Unless it turns into a piece of loess

163
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,160
You haven't said a word for half a year

164
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,200
Facing this old window all day long

165
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,319
Do you really think

166
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,759
Can I be detached from this world

167
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,919
People who can replace you are like crucian carp crossing the river

168
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,720
It's just that I don't allow resistance

169
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,040
I don't allow anyone to say no to me

170
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,319
Crown Princess

171
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,439
Ali grew up with my own eyes

172
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,999
It's a courtesy

173
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:04,679
A good girl who knows the rules

174
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,879
Please look at my thin noodles

175
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,160
Give her another chance

176
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,679
Silly child

177
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,999
Refuse to enter the palace

178
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,239
There are only two roads left

179
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,480
Become a monk or die

180
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,840
You are so young

181
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:29,559
Do you really have to hinge your hair

182
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,919
Have you been with the ancient Buddha with green lanterns all your life

183
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,879
The Crown Princess forced me into the palace

184
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,640
You are not afraid of bringing disaster

185
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,200
Name has been determined

186
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,960
I advise you not to be wishful thinking

187
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Be your great grandwife honestly

188
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,119
But I'm not reconciled

189
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,559
Do you dare to gamble

190
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,239
When you know the prosperity of this supreme and expensive place,

191
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,600
I've seen my son again

192
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,520
All unwillingness will vanish

193
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,119
At that time

194
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,999
I'm waiting for you to beg me

195
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,559
Give you this grace

196
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,960
You have been in the palace for some time

197
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,119
Do you know what is the supreme place in the world

198
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,879
Back to the empress's words

199
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,280
The so-called royal family

200
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Prosperity, splendor and supreme power

201
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,319
There is no one like me in the world

202
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,400
Have you ever seen the prince

203
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:57,559
His Royal Highness the Prince is wise and wise

204
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,280
Smart decision

205
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,600
There is also a benevolence of loving the people and caring for the people

206
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,919
I will make a decree tomorrow

207
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,919
Make you a prince concubine

208
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,840
The handmaiden thanks the empress for her kindness

209
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,319
Please take back your life

210
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,239
What are you talking about

211
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,200
Handmaiden's blessings are shallow

212
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,400
Shame and dare not accept it

213
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,679
Seeing Imperial Power and Not Admire Imperial Power

214
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,799
Know splendor and don't envy splendor

215
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,799
You are at ease

216
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,200
But between you and him

217
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
There is a predestined fate

218
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,720
Are you willing to cut it off together

219
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,679
Handmaiden

220
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
When I first entered the palace

221
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,400
Always have grievances in my heart

222
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,160
Can get along with your highness day and night

223
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,879
A cavity of ice and snow is also melted because of him

224
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,720
Empress

225
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,999
Handmaiden sincerely admires your highness

226
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,439
But affection and freedom must finally make a choice

227
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,720
Handmaiden is unwilling to be a princess

228
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,559
Please help the empress

229
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,040
Do you know what you're saying

230
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,280
The empress promised the handmaiden that she would let me go

231
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,160
How dare you speak so presumptuously in front of me

232
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,720
I am the ruler of this harem

233
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,520
As long as I don't let you go

234
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,239
You have to be deferential in this harem

235
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,559
Be your prince's wife

236
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,559
Spread children for the royal family

237
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Handmaiden is naive and foolish

238
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,360
Unknown doctrine

239
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,519
Even more unworthy to serve your highness

240
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,480
How dare you say such a thing so boldly

241
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,240
No matter how hard your bones are

242
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,240
A knife and axe that is hard but sharp

243
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,760
Your will is firm again

244
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,000
Can't shake the supreme imperial power

245
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,799
The reason why you can talk to me like this

246
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,120
Is nothing more than taking advantage of my tolerance and compassion

247
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,880
When you run out of my last patience

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,720
Your brother, you are the nine families of Sun Shi

249
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,720
It will overturn in an instant

250
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,039
The world says

251
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,240
Empress is gentle and lenient

252
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,720
But they are all wrong about you

253
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,000
Your will is far more determined than any man

254
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,279
The decision is far from comparable to human beings

255
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,760
But

256
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,080
What the rest of the heart wants

257
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,159
Die nine times without regret

258
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,679
Handmaiden retires

259
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,159
Empress, this maid is so rude

260
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,639
You shouldn't forgive her any more

261
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,960
Sure enough, it is soft, waxy, sweet, crisp and delicious

262
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,200
When I was in trouble,

263
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,279
She can stand by and watch

264
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,480
But she put aside the past and ran for me

265
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,279
Mother is right

266
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,559
She's a good kid

267
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,519
Empress

268
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,360
I just want to see

269
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,919
Does anyone really dare to disobey the imperial power in this world

270
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,639
Even

271
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,559
Resist the arrangement of fate

272
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,120
Wait for me here

273
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,000
Elder sister invited each other late at night

274
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,399
What's so important

275
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:07,519
What is this

276
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,120
Subcharacter

277
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,240
Machamp Chaos I don't need it

278
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,840
If elder sister asked me to come here for this matter,

279
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,960
Then I'll go back first

280
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,240
The Crown Princess accepted it

281
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,319
I said I don't need

282
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Elder sister

283
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:37,039
In fact, it doesn't matter whether you have children or not

284
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,840
My sister sincerely prayed to heaven

285
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,240
May you have peace and joy all your life

286
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,960
This wish is enough

287
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:46,639
Elder sister

288
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,799
Why do you keep saying such strange things tonight

289
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,760
Elder sister

290
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:06,760
Elder sister

291
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,399
Purple Azolla

292
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,960
Why are you stunned?

293
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,679
Why are you distracted

294
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,880
Nothing

295
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,319
It's really okay

296
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:07,000
But this tofu practices knife skills

297
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,799
I don't know how long I have to practice

298
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,000
What

299
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,439
Last time I saw Fang Dianshan making Vince tofu

300
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,559
Later, I heard that at the tofu banquet,

301
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,200
There are 158 tofu dishes

302
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,799
She was possessed

303
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,639
Facing that piece of tofu every day

304
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,880
I don't know what I'm doing

305
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:37,799
Come with me

306
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,760
Your Highness

307
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,840
Although your majesty has spared the golden beads of toes

308
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,039
Buying tea lessons in Shaanxi and Sichuan

309
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,880
However, there are still many places to buy and collect

310
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,960
Wasting people and money

311
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,159
For example, Dan lacquer azurite paid tribute every year

312
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,960
Regardless of whether it is produced locally

313
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,039
Collect it all

314
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
Forcing people to sell their property

315
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,840
Buy Dan lacquer azurite at a high price

316
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,279
To complete the apportionment of the government

317
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:01,679
Profiteers take the opportunity to drive up

318
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,279
As a result, prices have soared dozens of times

319
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,559
The people went bankrupt

320
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,919
Why did you stop me from writing

321
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't think you are scolding profiteers

322
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,519
Are you scolding

323
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,600
Eunuchs sent by my father to buy everywhere

324
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:15,880
Do you know that

325
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,439
Those who my father sent

326
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,840
Most of them are people he values

327
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,600
Some are even confidants who have served for many years

328
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,439
Do you think Father believes in you or them

329
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
I can't let someone like you

330
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,960
Be victimized by slanderers

331
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,240
I am now a censor

332
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,799
It is the responsibility of supervising the departments to report illegal activities

333
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,799
You can't sit back and watch eunuchs become misfortunes

334
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,200
It's a mess for me.

335
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,000
Your Highness, you should also be alert to the villains around you

336
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,639
Do not be fooled by them

337
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,080
Your Highness

338
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:24,919
Reward you

339
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,360
His Royal Highness

340
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,919
Good tea

341
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,039
Good tea. Good tea. Thank you, Your Highness

342
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,000
Gentle water moistens everything

343
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,000
Violent water destroys fields and hurts people

344
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,240
So people fix water trucks

345
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,679
Building dams to prevent floods in Xingyuan

346
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,279
Water is so

347
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,519
So do people

348
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,799
Eunuchs fought with Grandpa Huang for many years

349
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,600
There are indeed many talents around me

350
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:13,519
Sure enough, it is one

351
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,080
Honest and brave young talents

352
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,639
What

353
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:19,639
Go

354
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,600
This way this way

355
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,159
Come back

356
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,559
Why are you here

357
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,200
I came to see your sweetheart

358
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,760
Zheng Sanbao fought bravely and fought several times to the West

359
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,480
I also lost my ha and went to work as a slave for many times

360
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,319
Zhaofu local ethnic groups

361
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:49,480
Of course

362
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,159
There are also private news from the imperial court

363
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,679
Huang Yan who is plotting evil

364
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,799
Eunuch and Water

365
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,399
Even it is no different from officials

366
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,600
There is no distinction between good and evil

367
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,480
It just depends on how to use it

368
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,760
Your Highness is wrong

369
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,799
The sword is in the hand of the chivalrous man

370
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,399
You can be chivalrous

371
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,960
Fall into the hands of bandits and bandits

372
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,600
It is a weapon to kill people

373
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,159
Da Ming Guo Zuo concerns all people

374
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Today, the merciful prince is wise

375
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,519
Can hold this sharp blade firmly

376
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
But who can guarantee that

377
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,399
From generation to generation, there are saints and lords in Daming

378
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:24,519
Bold

379
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:27,279
Out

380
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,120
Out

381
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:35,840
Yes

382
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,559
You

383
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,840
Impeach Royal Guards again

384
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,799
Impeach the eunuchs again

385
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,319
How many time have I told you

386
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,559
What are the words in my heart

387
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,720
Just talk to me in private

388
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,799
You swear so openly

389
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,480
Be careful that someone behind you makes a cold arrow

390
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,399
Now that your highness knows it's a villain

391
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,279
Why do you stay around?

392
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,120
When I was young,

393
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,600
Yuan Qi waited on me

394
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,679
I accidentally fell off my horse once

395
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,679
He jumped at the guard

396
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:09,720
He was seriously injured and lay down for a year

397
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,519
Shaoyuan

398
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,000
Even if it is a villain of humble origin,

399
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,000
It is also flesh and blood

400
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,480
I'll prepare the meal

401
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,399
Isn't this too fragrant

402
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:40,319
Zi Jin

403
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,039
You said this stinky tofu

404
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,120
It smells so bad

405
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,720
Why does it taste so delicious

406
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,120
Fragrant bar

407
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,120
Zi Jin

408
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,240
The first piece is mine

409
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,840
You are not allowed to rob mine

410
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,319
My my mine

411
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,960
My mine my mine

412
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,200
Give me a bite, too

413
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,519
Eat slowly and be careful of scalding

414
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,439
Zi Jin

415
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,480
Run so fast just now

416
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,480
Ask you and you ignore me

417
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,919
What can I do now

418
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,799
I

419
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,200
Have a quick taste

420
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,200
Meng Shang's food is coming

421
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,240
This year's Shangyuan Festival

422
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,039
Long live Aoshan lamp should be set up in the palace

423
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,880
Pray for peace in the world

424
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:36,480
Your Majesty will also reward officials with banquets

425
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,319
You all have to cheer up

426
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,519
Deal with it well

427
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,519
Yes

428
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:45,679
Meng Shang Shi

429
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,720
If I remember correctly

430
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:51,720
The competition between us

431
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,319
It hasn't been decided yet, has it

432
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,880
Hu Shang Shi

433
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,360
It has come to this point

434
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,799
Aren't you willing to stop

435
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,000
No matter what, I am still eating

436
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,919
On Grade

437
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:09,399
Not yet

438
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,880
You are presumptuous in front of me

439
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,919
Is this still necessary now

440
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,159
Meng Shang Shi

441
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:16,840
You are already the master of the food bureau

442
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,600
But the competition is a competition after all

443
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,279
There is no tie between the winner and the loser

444
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,039
How to convince people

445
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,080
This third game

446
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,120
Are you willing to fight

447
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:28,600
What is a bet

448
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,840
On the Yuan Festival, a banquet was given to officials

449
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,039
Let's try this

450
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
If I win by luck

451
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:38,799
Meng Shangshi should be in front of the world

452
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,880
Admit yourself that you are inferior to others

453
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,880
If I lose

454
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,279
I asked myself to leave the palace

455
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,720
Never step into the Forbidden City again

456
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,840
How

457
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,960
As you wish

458
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:16,880
If she hadn't been

459
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,240
Crown Princess's own sister

460
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,159
Will she be allowed to linger for so long

461
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,120
Now bring disgrace to oneself

462
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,319
Meng Shangshi hasn't taken the opportunity yet

463
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,439
Get her out of the palace

464
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,279
Are you right, Zihao

465
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,639
Don't talk about it

466
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,840
Can you promise me two things

467
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,240
Two pieces

468
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Sweet bean pudding

469
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,081
How can bean curd be sweet

470
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:08,760
Back to your highness's words

471
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:10,360
It was prepared by the Food Bureau

472
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:19,360
How is bean curd sweet

473
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:20,400
Why is bean curd

474
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,280
Make it sweet

475
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,480
What the hell is in here

476
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:24,841
Back to your highness's words

477
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:26,480
It's inside

478
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,841
It's possible that it's sugar

479
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,681
Or syrup

480
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,120
It could also be sweet-scented osmanthus

481
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:34,841
I don't know the specific handmaiden either

482
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:37,161
How could anyone in this world

483
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:38,841
Put sugar in bean curd

484
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:41,721
Your Highness doesn't know

485
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,041
My grandmother

486
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,000
It is a native of Jingzhou Prefecture

487
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
I made it for my minister since I was a child

488
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,681
This is the sweet tofu pudding

489
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:48,360
Especially sweet and delicious

490
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,721
This

491
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:52,120
But this is obviously a pot

492
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,240
How do you taste salty and sweet

493
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,280
It doesn't smell at all

494
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,640
The handmaiden saw it with his own eyes

495
00:33:58,561 --> 00:33:59,360
That's a

496
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,441
A piece of copper that divides the pot into two

497
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,201
The copper sheet was smeared

498
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,321
Specific

499
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:06,000
After the handmaiden asked

500
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,041
Talk back and forth again

501
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,841
What nonsense

502
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,240
Tofu can only be salty

503
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,441
I've done the first favor

504
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,760
Why don't you just help me one more time

505
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,081
I've never heard you mention it before

506
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:40,000
You two

507
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
Did you meet me outside the palace

508
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:44,321
Then since I like him,

509
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:45,561
Why do you keep pushing me

510
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,441
I just became a palm meal.

511
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Limited salary

512
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,120
Gold pearls and jade from my daughter's house

513
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,600
I don't even have a ropa khan towel

514
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,760
Those poems and words

515
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,520
I don't understand either

516
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,841
How to express affection

517
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,081
Only do one or two

518
00:34:58,081 --> 00:34:59,240
A delicious meal

519
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,321
To the fullest of one's mind

520
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,561
Just help me this time

521
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,840
Haoziliao

522
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:06,161
I'm begging you, son

523
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
Haoziliao

524
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,001
I am grateful to you all my life

525
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:14,681
Go, go, go, go

526
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:15,360
Purple Azolla

527
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,161
Go on

528
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Let Shangshi Bureau in the future

529
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,721
No more sweet bean curd

530
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,560
Yes

531
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,921
Your Highness

532
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,961
This book

533
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,201
It seems that Lord Mei borrowed it

534
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:32,961
He forgot to take it

535
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,161
The handmaiden will send it now

536
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,201
Give it to me

537
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,320
A house full of sweet odors

538
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,040
Go out for relaxation

539
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:47,721
There is really someone

540
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:49,320
Love sweet bean curd

541
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,281
Lord Mei

542
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,800
Yao canon meal

543
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,600
This is the meal for you from the Shang Food Bureau

544
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,161
Thank you very much

545
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,400
Your Highness, what do you see me do

546
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:34,600
Where's the food box

547
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,120
What food box

548
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
That's not for your highness

549
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,441
Your Highness

550
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:45,120
This, this can't fall

551
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,320
You give me give me give me

552
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,201
Didn't your highness say it himself

553
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,600
No one is allowed to mention it again

554
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,241
Handmaiden naturally dare not disobey

555
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:55,840
You go and get twenty sticks

556
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,921
Your Highness Your Highness

557
00:36:59,481 --> 00:36:59,880
That's the supply

558
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,080
Tea and rice for ministers entering the palace

559
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,481
It stands to reason

560
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:03,880
This deserves to be Guanglu Temple Office

561
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,360
But they fool errands all day long

562
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,001
Cook a meal

563
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,241
How bad it tastes

564
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,360
Guangluqing has just been reprimanded by your majesty

565
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,880
On the grounds of organizing the annual banquet,

566
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,800
Take this errand

567
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,761
It was pushed to the Shang Food Bureau

568
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,120
Really

569
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:17,840
It's absolutely true

570
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,080
I didn't say a word of redundancy

571
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:22,721
The food boxes are all

572
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:23,880
Pass it through my hand

573
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,481
Then why smile so happily

574
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,481
Accepted

575
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,600
Great, great

576
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:40,001
Now I can get revenge

577
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,001
Make way, make way, make way

578
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,120
You say it again

579
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,120
Fresh Meat Lantern Festival

580
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,281

00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,161
Bamboo insect bee pupa grasshopper

582
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:11,481
Don't you look at me like that

583
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:14,360
Fried bee pupae is crisp and tender

584
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Is it a top-grade delicacy

585
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,281
Yin Ziping

586
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:18,600
You are clearly

587
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,640
Deliberately bullying Lord Mei

588
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:39,120
Sachet sachet

589
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:42,681
Run slowly

590
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:47,721
Pain, pain, pain

591
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,640
Why did you steal

592
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,400
You let go of me

593
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:51,441
Don't learn well at a young age

594
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:52,681
Go with me to the yamen and let go

595
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:58,880
I didn't steal the money I didn't steal

596
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,040
You let go of me

597
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:02,521
You let go of me

598
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,080
What's going on

599
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:05,921
This man steals

600
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:07,281
Arrest it for me

601
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,120
Yes yes

602
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
I've said all the good things

603
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,800
Begged him for half an hour

604
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,441
He handed me over to the chief anyway

605
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,481
People are asking you to turn over a new leaf

606
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,481
Be innocent

607
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,961
He won't let me go in the end

608
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,481
Wait outside the cell

609
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,840
I have to be an apprentice in a restaurant

610
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,001
Restaurant apprentices need guarantors

611
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:28,400
He is personally surety for you

612
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,800
Force you to earn your own living

613
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,840
What a nice man

614
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,921
Don't let him fool you

615
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,281
On this surface

616
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:36,640
A gentle scholar

617
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,441
The heart is so black and cruel

618
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,161
He took my wages

619
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:42,761
There must be a misunderstanding in this

620
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,040
What's the misunderstanding

621
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,481
I won't give him arsenic

622
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:46,600
I'm already a good man

623
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,281
Yin Ziping

624
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:48,560
Zi Jin

625
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,921
Zi Jin

626
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,521
The wine from the Royal Wine Shop has arrived

627
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,400
You go check it

628
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:54,961
Yes

629
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:56,320
Purple Azolla

630
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:57,320
Why don't you help, too

631
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,481
Jinhua wine Changchun wine

632
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,320
One bucket of Taixi White

In

635
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:19,761
Let them all move in

636
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:20,560
Yes

637
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,201
Move quickly

638
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,040
Yes yes

639
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,320
Be gentle

640
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,001
Han Tan Chun Wu Wei Tang

641
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,481
Move all this inside

642
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,281
Be careful

643
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,521
Lotus and sweet-scented osmanthus brew

644
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,120
Chrysanthemum pulp and orchid drink are two barrels each

645
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,800
Slow down

646
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,681
Let me see

647
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:37,921
The Jubilee of Taixi White

648
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,961
Write like this

649
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,961
You write it again

650
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,320
Almost

651
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:51,640
That's a big difference

652
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,600
You see

653
00:40:59,281 --> 00:40:59,840
Be careful

654
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,721
There was an accident in the wine warehouse

655
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,001
Yao Ziliao was seriously injured and unconscious

656
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,241
Did you do it

657
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:22,880
What reason do I have to do this

658
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,161
You help me to the top

659
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,640
Just to control the food bureau

660
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:26,921
Although I don't know

661
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:27,761
Your real purpose

662
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,441
But in order to remove obstacles,

663
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:30,880
Nature can do whatever it takes

664
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,201
The eunuch who was caught

665
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,320
He is still being held in Gongzhengsi

666
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,521
What did he say

667
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,120
He insisted that it was an accident

668
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,040
Your opponent is injured

669
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,120
Shouldn't you be happy

670
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:47,080
I

671
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,120
Seasonal medicine

672
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,161
When will Zi Jin wake up

673
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:10,001
Your own injuries

674
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:10,880
I'm okay

675
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:13,600
What happened to her

676
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:16,481
When an accident occurs

677
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:17,681
It's a good thing you got in the way

678
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,560
Really hit the head

679
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,201
I'm afraid in this life

680
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:21,161
I can't wake up

681
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,481
Then her hand

682
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,481
Will there be hidden dangers in her hands

683
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,481
Meng Shang Shi

684
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:31,161
Yao Dianshan's Hand

685
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:32,281
Need careful aftercare

686
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:33,961
Specific circumstances

687
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:35,040
After she wakes up,

688
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,001
Re-judge

689
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,120
From now on

690
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:41,040
The rest of the people move out of here

691
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,761
Give her peace of mind to recuperate

692
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,360
Give her medicine first

693
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,560
Yes

694
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,921
Although drinking should be warm,

695
00:43:16,481 --> 00:43:17,600
But you have to divide different wines

696
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,640
Different wines

697
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,600
Use different temperatures

698
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,681
Only in this way can we not lose the original taste

699
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:25,320
All I know is that cold wine hurts my stomach

700
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Overheating and lung injury

701
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:28,201
Therefore, we can only use warm wine

702
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,441
But I don't know when to warm the wine

703
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,521
There is also a lot of knowledge

704
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:33,400
Why don't you come down to the temple and teach me

705
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,040
Good or not

706
00:43:59,161 --> 00:43:59,600
Zi Jin

707
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:00,961
You're awake

708
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:03,201
Purple Azolla

709
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,281
My hand

710
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:15,040
Don't worry, son

711
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,360
Ji Dian's Theory of Medicine

712
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
You just have to have a good rest

713
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:18,320
It will be fine

714
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:19,761
You mustn't move your hand

715
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:20,481
It hurts

716
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:42,560
Crown Princess

717
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,761
Your Highness drank wine

718
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,040
Just say some headaches

719
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,080
Let's take a break first

720
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,241
What the hell is going on

721
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:49,721
Now that your highness has rested,

722
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:51,001
Handmaiden is later

723
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:52,120
Then report the government affairs

724
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,961
Handmaiden leaves first
