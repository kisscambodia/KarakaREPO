don't keep looking at me

13
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,320
It's hard to eat a piece of meat

14
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
What's the fun of being a man

15
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,679

Unique flavor

Fresh and smooth

25

melt-in-the-mouth

26
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,799
When I was in the boudoir

27
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,880
My mother often cooks crucian carp soup by herself.

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,920
This dish is based on white fungus and yellow otolithiasis

50
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,799

00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,239
Just a moment of neglect

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,960
The finished dish has a slight aroma of wine

74
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:36,919
oily but not greasy

75
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,359
Three things about the dish name Fushouquan

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,880
Meat and incense around the tongue

77
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,479
Soup is rich

78
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,080
Unforgettable

79
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,119

87
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,400
Grandpa Emperor has a rare appetite

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,119
It seems to be the credit of the crab soup

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
crab paste

90
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,520
Yes

91
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,599
Crab meat is the freshest thing in the world

92
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,760
only Beng Dajia

93
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,880
Can compete with Fu Shouquan in three matters

94
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,599
But now is not the best season to eat crabs

95
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,119
Can't get the best out of the soup

96
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,919
I use crab paste to make tofu soup

97
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,520
The world's lightest and most delicious

98
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,719
Combining two ingredients

99
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,640
The freshness of the crab is neutralized with the clearness of tofu

100
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,840
to be just right

101
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Crab sauce is still so effective

102
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,039
That's no ordinary crab sauce

103
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,919
The fattest hairy crabs in mid to late September

104
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,679
Forget the crab meat

105
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,640
Only take crab paste and crab roe

106
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,880
Crafted Bald Butter

107
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,760
Crispy and fragrant

108
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,919
The taste of the world

109
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,000
Where can ordinary crab sauce be compared?

110
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,799
and

111
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,400
that tea

112
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,760
No wonder

113
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,599
Get rid of fishy smell and oiliness with common tea

114
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,880
tongue to taste

115
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,039
The fragrance of tofu and the deliciousness of crab sauce

116

118
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,479
So how many wins and losses do we have now?

119
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,479
What happened to our first game?

120
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,479
They won the first game

121
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,119
they won

122
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:54,919
What about the second game?

123
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,640
What's up with the second game?

124
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,479
I do not know either

125
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,280
Why did it come back intact?

126
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,719
Princess Han has asthma

127
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,119
Do not eat chicken clear all the year round

128
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,640
To avoid angering the princess

129
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,159
So I called people to withdraw.

130
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,359
What did you say

131
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,760

But I made fried walnuts

143
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,479
each waist flower

144
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,520
It's all dipped in chicken.

145
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,599
not good

146
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
The princess is suffering from a recurring illness

147
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,880

Said that he has been watching the sky differently recently

180

00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,119
third brother

198
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,799
third

199
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,599
You really colluded with people to poison your father

200
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,960
conspiracy to usurp the throne

201
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm greedy

202
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,400
big brother

203
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,479
what do you say

204
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,559
what to say

205
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,000
what's wrong

206
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,119
Why are you making such a slander

207
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,239
My loyalty and filial piety to my father

208
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,000
That is where the sky and the earth can be seen, the sun and the moon can be seen.

209
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
How can I collude with people

210
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Conspiracy

211
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,280
Who said that

212
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,559
is it you

213
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Who instructed you to frame this king?

214
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,719
To shut up

215
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,000
go down

216
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,200
Yes

217
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:19,880
Yes

218
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,440
I said the third

219
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,200
Chang Shanwei is your escort

220
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,719
Who can mobilize it but you?

221
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,919
Everyone was detained and still refused to recognize

222
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,520
no

223
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,359
father emperor

224
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,599
I just had a drink

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
fell asleep

226
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,479
I don't know what happened

227
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,479
But someone must have framed it

228
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,000
I want to trap my sons and ministers in injustice, father and emperor

229
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,839
let him drink

230
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:18,880
emperor

231
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,520
go

232
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,359
His Royal Highness Zhao Wang

233
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,239
Since you know nothing

234
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
why not drink

235
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,400
father emperor

236
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,520
There are no elite soldiers and generals in the hands of Erchen

237
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,000
More selfless friends in the military

238
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,199
Sonny is really alone

239
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,199
Stayed in Beijing for a few years

240
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:23,359
That's half a step, don't dare to go wrong

241
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,880
that formed partisans in the army

242
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,079
adored by warriors

243
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,079
who is it

244
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,599
The third one hurt me again

245
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,920
Son-in-law is wrong

246
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,680
in the early years of war

247
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,599
Erchen has a lifelong friendship with many generals

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,239
But it was a tough battle.

249
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,880
Since Erchen went to the fief

250
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,719
I will never have any dealings with these generals.

251
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:55,880
I don't even know where to start with the so-called support.

252
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,040
To be favored by courtiers

253
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,160
Who in the world is better than Big Brother?

254
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,640
Those sour civil servants in this court

255
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,839
That's not a mouthful of Prince Rende

256
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,119
father and father

257
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,719
The son and the minister wronged the father and the emperor

258
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,199
Okay don't say it

259
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:24,839
father emperor

260
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
today's drink

261
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,319
Erchen is willing to drink

262
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,719
but before drinking

263
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,119
Sonny must swear to God

264
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,239
I have no intention of committing chaos

265
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,319
What happened today must be someone trying to frame it

266
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,880
There must be someone trying to do the oriole behind.

267
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,239
father emperor

268
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,959
If you insist on using this glass of wine today

269
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,199
Words of Innocence

270
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,560
Erchen is willing to do it

271
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,000
father emperor

272
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,560
Can't make the father

273
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,640
The third brother has always been humble and wise

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,359
Never act against

275
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,920
This time it must be wrong

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,760
If this is a glass of booze

277
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,560
Son-in-law is willing to take the place of himself

278
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,079
I come

279
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,319
big brother

280
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,880
I come

281
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,560
big brother

282
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,319
third brother

283
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,119
big brother

284
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,640
third brother

285
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,239
big brother

286
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:15,760
okay

287
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,800
They all want to drink poisoned wine to prove their innocence

288
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,959
Don't you dare to be alone?

289
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm innocent too

290
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:21,839
come to me

291
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:22,959
Give me

292
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,239
enough

293
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,319
grandfather

294
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,280
My grandson hasn't finished speaking yet.

295
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
Meng Xian Peng Xu

296
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,439
Just a mere commander

297
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,880
How many soldiers can you have?

298
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,520
To hijack the heavily guarded inner vault

299
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
just nonsense

300
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,479
The two uncles are extremely smart

301
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,560
How can you do such a stupid thing

302
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,199
grandson already found out

303
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,719
It's just the conspiracy of those ignorant subordinates

304
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,000
Nothing to do with the two uncles

305
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,319
Zhanji

306
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
you said earlier

307
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Uncle San is timid

308
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
You scared the third uncle to death

309
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:04,920
two uncles

310
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,479
You are too quick

311
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,199
Don't wait for me to finish

312
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,640
Even if they weren't behind the scenes

313
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,760
It is also arrogant and indulgent on weekdays

314
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,119
Make a bunch of subordinates greedy

315
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,800
usurpation of power

316
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,599
Your Majesty, rest your anger

317
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,800
edict

318
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,199
Wang Shecheng is seductive with celestial phenomena

319
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,920
punish

320
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,079
The rest of the accused, etc.

321
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,599
Xiazhen Fusi Prison Rigorous Trial

322
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,719
slave servant

323
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,280
you two

324
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,920
Zhao Wang closed his door to self-examination

325
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:46,920
Yes

326
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,640
and you

327
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,680
Go back to your fief to me tomorrow

328
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,400
Father Xie

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,280
Hanwang arrives

330
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:05,880
sister in law

331
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:22,719
Mother

332
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,920
Princess Han suffers from illness

333
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,680
Why not take care of the sick

334
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,680
Just stay in the fief and rest.

335
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,560
Dishes prepared by eight famous chefs of Shangshan Superintendent

336
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,359
how did you know in advance

337
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,880
And that walnut kidney flower

338
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,520
who reminds you

339
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,119
Specially cooked with chicken clear

The Princess of Han is known to have old illnesses

Take poached eggs in the morning to nourish your body

343
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
The walnut kernel fried kidney flower in the food list

344
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,280
Cooked with chicken broth as usual

345
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,560
It's him

346
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,479
Daughter

347
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,520
You believe me

348
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,599
I really didn't do anything

349
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,719
I don't know the princess of Han

350
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
I didn't know she had asthma

351
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,520
Daughter

352
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
You believe me

353
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,719
Of course you don't want to murder Princess Han

354
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,760
you just wanna frame me

355
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,640
What did you say

356
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,040
You clearly know that Princess Han has relapsed and died

357
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,479
The palm print of my Shang Food Bureau

358
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,719
Escape from negligence

359
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,119
This is not intentional framing, what is it?

360
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,079
dereliction of duty

361
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,760
You are so angry

362
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,719
Not because Princess Han died

363
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,839
I'm afraid of losing your place of honor

364
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
You just said him

365
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,680
who is it

366
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,880
tell me

367
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,439
Say

368
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,520
who is instructing you

369
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:04,599
no one instructs me

370
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I did it myself

371
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,199
I did it all

372
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,719
You are the stamp of the Shang Food Bureau

373
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,599
New Year's Eve killed

374
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,079
Of course you can't get away

375
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,079
I am anxious

376
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,319
just want to see

377
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,079
You look like nothing at the end

378
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,239
Look at you, a woman who has abandoned her husband

379
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,800
What will happen in the end

380
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,800
I did everything

381
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,880
I did it all

382
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,439
you are satisfied

383
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,760
you are so disappointing

Meng Shang food

385
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,880

Finding out the edict of treason is really child's play

390
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,319
third

391
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,119
usually meticulous

392
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,040
How can you leak the wind ahead of time?

393
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,000
Catch all at once

394
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,680
a Washington

395
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,560
if any

396
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,760
A greedy treasure

397
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,319
The thieves naturally keep

398
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,000
on the contrary

399
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,520
A ruined temple outside the city

400
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
Except for the spider web

401
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,520
nothing

402
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,199
even

403
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,239
Mice also don't want to patronize

404
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,400
Emperor Dragon Chair Power

405
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,079
how tempting

406
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
your uncles

407
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,880
While I am old and sick

408
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,880
colluding with eunuchs

409
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,439
Exchange messages

410
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't even hear them, I think

411
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,119
I am deaf and blind

412
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,959
who told you to scare them

413
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,000
grandfather

414
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,839
You are clearly scaring them

415
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,400
bold

416
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,280
Grandson never wrongs anyone

417
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
I have fought many times in my life

418
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,719
kill decisively

419
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,119
Strict precautions for parents and children

420
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,800
The world often scolds me for being cruel and violent

421
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
What do you think

422
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:49,959
Say

423
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,560
grandchildren's childhood

424
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Grandpa used to say

425
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,160
What is the leader

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,640
originally when people hunted

427
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,400
elect the bravest man in the crowd

428
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,160
as leader

429
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,520
and this person

430
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,359
The one who took the most lives from the beasts

431
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
Take up arms and organize an army

432
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,239
Protect tribes and food

433
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
This is the leader

434
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,880
tribe still

435
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,319
let alone a country

436
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,680
Ordinary people want to be a good person

437
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,119
Doing good deeds is

438
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,959
But for the emperor

439
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,079
Blindly adhere to the path of righteousness

440
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,280
will only become a mediocre emperor

441
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,319
What do you think is a good emperor?

442
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,079
for the people

443
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,280
for the country

444
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,640
benevolence and righteousness

445
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
close relatives

446
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,680
Even if you are scolded by thousands of people, you have to endure it

447
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
Adhere to the right path of the country

448
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,160
Defend your territory and people

449
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,119
This is the king

450
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:48,040
You always take care of your family

451
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,599
Leave room for them

452
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,479
Is that glass of wine poisonous?

453
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Although highly toxic

454
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,160
Only poisonous and rebellious heart

455
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,959
Poison can not defeat the real dragon emperor

456
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,719
Come

457
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
walk with grandpa

458
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,160
princess

459
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,959
What Happened at the New Year's Eve Banquet

460
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,560
It's all the slave's fault

461
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,760
The slaves are willing to be punished

462
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,199
don't defend yourself

463
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,920
Slaves are humble people

464
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,839
Relying on the protection of the princess

465
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,680
Only have a place to stand today

466
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,959
This should have been tied with a ring of grass to repay your kindness

467
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,079
New Year's Eve banquet because of my momentary negligence

468
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,160
Let the villain take the opportunity to make trouble

469
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,479
at this point

470
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,520
What face is there to justify in front of you?

471
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,280
Meng Shang food

472
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,280
Who do you mean by the villain?

473
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,160
People who know the righteousness in the world

474
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,199
Should understand the ruler, the minister, the father and the son

475
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,839
The principle of superiority and inferiority

476
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,520
I won't commit a crime with respect

477
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:17,640
Slaves and servants are not strict

478
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,160
Blindly forgiving

479
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,359
Actually let the villain have an inch to wait for an opportunity to make trouble

480
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:23,760
this one

481
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,719
Meng Shang food

482
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,319
Hu Sishan

483
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,000
Slaves serve the Lord wholeheartedly

484
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,079
Forget about the dangers that are close at hand

485
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,520
Did not check the food list again

486
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
Give the villain a chance to frame

487
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,439
It's the slave's fault

488
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,839
this second

489
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,479
It's just that the slaves are deeply grateful

490
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,400
have to be bold

491
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,880
A man who can betray Shangguan so easily

492
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,079
how to be trusted

493
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,239
How can you stay by your side?

494
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,000
The Imperial Physician has diagnosed and treated the Princess of Han

495
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,920
Said she was suffering from chronic diseases

496
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,560
This time, despite the dissuasion to come to Beijing for a long distance

497
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,160
relapse of old disease

498
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,119
no recovery

499
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,280
There is nothing wrong with the proposed food list of Guanglu Temple

500
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,959
There is nothing wrong with the food bureau making meals according to the order

501
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,920
Besides, His Majesty appreciates that crab soup very much.

502
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,119
The right to make meals still belongs to the Food Bureau

503
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,359
Ruoshang Food Bureau has nothing to do with the death of the princess

504
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,959
why

505
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,880
someone tipped off

506
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,719
You send private messages to the King of Han

507
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,800
you can plead guilty

508
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,280
This is a false accusation

509
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Hu Sishan

510
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,920
How dare you speak ill in front of your master without any evidence

511
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,119
Slaves meet the princess

512
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,160
That day at the Qianqing Palace

513
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,239
Witnessed Master Yuan being expelled from the main hall

514
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,920
Meng Shangshi once said that His Majesty was taking elixir

515
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,079
Poor dragon body

516
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,640
It is even more asserted that there will be a change in the palace

517
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,760
Slaves think about it later

518
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,479
fear

519
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,880
dare not report

520
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,479
Meng Shang food

521
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,839
If it wasn't for a private message with the King of Han

522
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,599
How can you know that something will happen in the palace?

523
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,280
Pay attention to everything

524
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,839
micro-knowledge

525
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,359
princess

526
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,000
Zu Xun has long said

527
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,119
Concubine and female official in the palace

528
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,839
Don't interfere in any affairs outside the palace gate

529
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,160
Meng Shangshi's private peeping on the Lord is a grave sin

530
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,800
Not to mention repeated messages with the vassal king

531
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,040
Besides, she used to repay the grace of King Han

532
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,520
against your will

533
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,000
Meng Shang food

534
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,599
Anyone who writes privately posts privately and communicates messages outside

535
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,040
Writer and receiver

536
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,239
You are the chef in the palace

537
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,719
knowingly

538
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,239
what to blame

539
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,479
If you want to add guilt, there is no excuse

540
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:08,239
princess

541
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,800
You are wise and wise

542
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,160
I actually believe this provocative statement

543
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,520
Doubt my loyalty?

544
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,400
over the years

545
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
you serve your majesty

546
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,959
Host the Food Bureau

547
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,800
Do your best

548
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,520
princess

549
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,400
But you privately peeped at the Lord and talked about palace changes

550
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,400
Words and deeds are really out of line

551
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,359
unforgivable sin

552
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,839
According to palace rules

553
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,239
Take away the post of Shangshi

554
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Go to Gong Zhengji yourself to get guilty

555
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,040
Do it yourself in the future

556
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
The slaves say goodbye

557
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,119
The Princess Wanwang cherishes

558
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,280
Congratulations

559
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,199
Meng Shang food

560
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,520
It's not a food anymore

561
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,959
how will i call you from now on

562
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,760
I'm curious

563
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,400
I trust to reuse you so much

564
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,640
why would you trust her

565
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,479
Entered the palace since a young age

566
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
We are inseparable friends

567
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,520
Later, he entered the Food Bureau

568
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,920
Because you are domineering and suspicious

569
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,439
anyone who doesn't like you

570
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,199
Always try to suppress eviction

571
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,640
we're blinding you

572
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
I've been pretending to be discordant

573
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,319
ten years

574
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,719
You pretended to be in front of me for ten years

575
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
Impressive

576
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,839
A Wai

577
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,920
don't be softhearted

578
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,360
I know

579
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,959
In addition to acting domineering

580
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,560
Fair enough

581
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,360
But as long as she is there one day

582
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,320
I'll never get out

583
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,479
these ten years

584
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
She has been covering the sky with her hands

585
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,919
We are obviously best friends

586
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,320
But always pretend to be discordant

587
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Are you having a hard time?

588
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,439
from now on

589
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,320
no longer needed

590
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,520
wake up wake up wake up

591
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,080
everyone is fine

592
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,280
safe and sound

593
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:04,320
great great great

594
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:04,959
it's fine

595
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,239
Great

596
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,399
it's finally okay

597
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,560
it's alright it's alright

598
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,040
I was just scared to death

599
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,719
what happened

600
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,320
Are you still to blame?

601
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,399
come come come

602
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:57,560
Come on

603
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,560
I wish you a healthy body

604
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,520
All things are

605
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,320
auspicious star

606
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,959
Everything goes smoothly

607
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,639
hurry up

608
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,080
Come

609
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,080
Come

610
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,360
thanks

611
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,199
Thank you thank you thank you

612
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,239
be careful

613
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:32,879
Come

614
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,080
Really tasty

615
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,560
Come on

616
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,679
get me some vinegar

617
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,679
Zijin

618
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,360
Happy new year

619
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,479
good luck

620
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,320
reward you

621
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,560
Thank you Your Highness

622
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,040
All the blessings of this Forbidden City

623
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,679
It's all in this bowl of flat food.

624
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,919
I eat first

625
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,919
Your Highness is worried

626
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:46,639
some things

627
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,560
I am confident

628
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,360
Do it with ease

629
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,719
some things

630
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,439
I haven't tried

631
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,479
I don't know how to deal with it

632
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:03,520
Your Highness

633
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,800
Not a single luck

634
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,439
It's empty

635
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,479
But I follow Your Highness

636
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,040
is my greatest fortune

637
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,479
It's you

638
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,280
why did you frame me

639
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,719
We are innocent

640
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:40,399
How can you

641
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,280
it's fair trade

642
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,600
you did something for me

643
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,679
And I also got the meal order from Shangshan Supervisor for you.

644
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,199
do you know

645
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,600
Because of you I became a murderer

646
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,479
it was all your fault

647
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,479
do not come

648
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:03,959
go away

649
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,199
who hurt you

650
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,800
what happened

651
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,399
Are you deliberately not happy?

652
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,800
Just like your murderous mother

653
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,080
My mother didn't kill

654
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,320
daughter of a criminal

655
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,679
How dare you talk back

656
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
you see i don't hit you

657
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,679
you come to me

658
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:43,280
see i don't hit you

659
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,199
see i don't hit you

660
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,600
My mother didn't kill

661
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,840
Tell you to talk back and not kill

662
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,760
i told you to talk back

663
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:48,800
you fight back

664
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:51,080
you're right

665
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:56,760
I'm not unaware

666
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,159
pretending not to know

667
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:00,919
i just want to know

668
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,120
if i am in danger

669
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,679
Will anyone notice

670
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,199
I've always followed the rules, if I do something wrong

671
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,040
Does anyone understand

672
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,679
Even one person is fine

673
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,199
I just didn't think of it

674
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,439
this error

675
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,520
at the cost of human life

676
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,040
It's my own choice

677
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,600
nothing to do with others

678
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,919
you go

679
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,159
you can hate me all you want

680
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,120
just in the future

681
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:01,399
don't put others

682
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,679
as your hope of living

683
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,840
how did you come out

684
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,840
walk into

685
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,560
what are you doing

686
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,040
Yuehua hasn't come back yet

687
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,320
you care about her

688
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,159
It's freezing, come in

689
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,080
you know

690
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:58,280
except you

691
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,520
Who has the courage to openly attack the princess?

692
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:02,760
too presumptuous

693
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:04,000
I said

694
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:06,800
Never let go of the initiator

695
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:09,320
She regrets it to this day

696
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,600
This time I'm here to see you

697
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,879
you bastard

698
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,399
Looks like you won't go back with me either.

699
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,600
Accompanying the king is like accompanying the tiger

700
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,439
But now our king

701
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
The worst thing is to be smart

702
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,280
hello do it yourself

703
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,760
After I leave Beijing

704
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,879
no message

705
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:52,399
Just take care of yourself

706
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,399
The father's teaching, the son remembers

707
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,919
And official business

708
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:57,040
one step ahead
