1
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Your Highness, you can't expect it

2
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,839
The leader of the Han Wangfu hasn't had time to carefully examine it

3
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,440
He mysteriously disappeared in prison

4
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,160
There is another mystery behind this matter

5
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
The crux lies in swimming a sail

6
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,639
Go to the Qing Palace

7
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,160
Your Highness

8
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,639
Your Highness

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,120
From Ganqing Palace

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,759
Your Highness, what does the emperor mean by this move

11
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,600
Your Highness

12
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,000
I still don't understand

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,520
Don't listen and watch Mo Wen

14
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
This is your majesty's will

15
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,440
The motto of serving the book

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,479
Study behind closed doors

17
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,440
Moon flower

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,559
Zi Jin

19
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,039
Why are you out when it's raining

20
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,759
Isn't it that the reward of empress Zhuang Fei is too expensive

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
I'm really ashamed of it

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,399
I made her some cakes and sent them over

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,559
Who knew it was raining so hard

24
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,520
What's the matter

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,119
You see you

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,399
It's all soaked

27
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,239
It's hot

28
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,040
Zi Jin

29
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,799
Zi Jin

30
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,040
Mother

31
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,880
Poor Zi Jin

32
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,720
My mother is gone

33
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,440
Where is your mother

34
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,160
Go and ask

35
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,959
Just go down

36
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,839
It's your highness

37
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,799
Dong an governs Jinyang

38
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,079
Ask for politics in Jian Lao

39
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,920
Jian Lao Yue

40
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:13,839
Loyalty, Faith and Dare

41
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,600
Dong Anyu said

42
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,440
An Zhonghu

43
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,720
This Liu lecturer is famous for his rattling

44
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,279
He talks about it many times on weekdays

45
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Your Highness can endure it

46
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,959
What's going on today

47
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
How do you feel your highness is upset

48
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,160
Knowing to ask

49
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,679
I-I'm going to the food bureau

50
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,359
His Highness, he won't let me go

51
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,920
It's just a palace maid who delivers food

52
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,720
It matters very much whether you come or not

53
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,920
Maybe

54
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
It burns on the stove

55
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,920
The kitchen knife is hurt

56
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,399
It is also possible that when carrying water,

57
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,000
Maybe I accidentally planted it

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,679
You are bad

59
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,760
I can recite this one already

60
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,799
I read it again, and the great sense of honor is clear to my heart

61
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,200
You don't have to read it over and over again

62
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,399
Let's call it a day

63
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,399
You go down first

64
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,760
Yes

65
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,559
Joke joke

66
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,679
In a good mood today

67
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,239
I'm going hunting outside the city

68
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,239
Chen Wu

69
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,399
It all went headlong into the well

70
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,600
Your Highness is still indifferent

71
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,640
You made a mistake this time

72
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,519
Don't you go soon

73
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,640
Your Highness has caught it

74
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,959
Your Highness sent it this morning

75
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,760
Etiquette statement

76
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Luo Zhuer, a left-behind Zhongwei soldier in Nanjing

77
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
His wife Yin Shi gave birth to three men

78
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,679
Please give rice banknotes according to the old rules

79
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,559
Qin Tianjian reported that there were stars as big as lights last night

80
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,520
Cyanine white

81
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
Guizhou provincial judges reported by Hu Qi

82
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,400
There are auspicious animals in mountains and rivers

83
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,799
White matter and black chapter, the first tiger body

84
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
Your Highness hasn't finished reading yet

85
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,200
Give me the rest

86
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
It's all useless verbosity

87
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Send this to Grandpa Huang

88
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,280
Your Highness, is this wrong

89
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,239
The grain is abundant and the weather is good

90
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,000
When the people are rich, they are Shangrui

91
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,239
What does catching an exotic beast have to do with Rui

92
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,400
What to do with the people

93
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,039
Go tell Hu Qi

94
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,960
Lying about auspicious luck all day long

95
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,119
He won't have to do it as a provincial judge

96
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes

97
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,359
Yuan Qi

98
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,440
Your Highness

99
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,719
You go to Shangshi Bureau in person

100
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,520
After seven days, it's getting worse and worse

101
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,919
Yes

102
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,159
The new drug just sent by the pharmacy department

103
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,320
Fry this suit

104
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,000
This

105
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,119
Come

106
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,559
Ginseng tonifies yang of the five internal organs

107
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,159
Fang Dianshan said that she had asked for medicine for a long time

108
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,239
Only willing to give up a few pieces

109
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,159
But I'll watch

110
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,239
This is no ordinary ginseng

111
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,119
Father-in-law Yuan

112
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,960
Everything has been done according to your orders

113
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,679
What if anyone is still talking about it

114
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,400
You can rest assured

115
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,640
I know the importance of this matter

116
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,039
Never make public

117
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,679
But

118
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,320
What's the matter

119
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,320
This

120
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,640
What's the matter

121
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,440
We can't give and receive privately in this palace

122
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,479
Could you please give it to Father Chen

123
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,359
To Chen Wu

124
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,520
To Chen Wu

125
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,799
I give you a fart. I

126
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,080
I'll give you a fart, give it, give it

127
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,840
No vision, no vision, no vision

128
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,719
I'm no better looking than Chen Wu

129
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,479
Banquet peach

130
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,440
Clearly let you deliver meals for Hu Si's meal

131
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,719
How can you pass the buck

132
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Meng Shangshi ordered him to come down

133
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,960
Let me hurry

134
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,719
Take someone to the cellar to get bacon enema

135
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm really overwhelmed

136
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,440
Just let the corn millet send it

137
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,559
Guo Bianfei always sends people over

138
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,400
After a while, I said I wanted milk cakes and milk skins

139
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,679
After a while, he said that he would prepare a crisp cake and send it there

140
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,080
I really can't get away either

141
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,039
Snow reed

142
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,520
Didn't I ask you to deliver it

143
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,919
You see

144
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,080
These sesame oils and sweet sauces

145
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,159
And douchi miscellaneous materials have just been delivered

146
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm counting it

147
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,559
You still eat

148
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,520
Zi Jin

149
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,479
Hu Sishan accidentally sprained his foot yesterday

150
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,880
Can you bring her food

151
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,239
Yes

152
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:50,919
Then I'll go right away

153
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,640
Hu Si Shan

154
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Bring you a meal

155
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
On weekdays, it is a saddle

156
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,400
One by one is too attentive

157
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,159
Now see Meng Shangshi doesn't like me

158
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,320
They are all afraid of touching some edges

159
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,000
Push and push

160
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,640
I pushed you here

161
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,960
Please have your meal

162
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,799
Good self-restraint and patience

163
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,080
Wait a minute

164
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,799
What else do you want from the steward

165
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,320
Would you follow me

166
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,039
Moon flower

167
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,080
This is the famous score I have collected for ten years

168
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,880
Many of them are incomplete

169
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,599
I've been trying to restore it

170
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,200
But one's strength is limited after all

171
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,400
Please help me in the future

172
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,479
Complete the compilation of this ancient spectrum of drinking in past dynasties

173
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,679
Wang Si's meal

174
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,039
This is all your efforts

175
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,200
How can I watch it

176
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,559
Meng Shangshi entrusted you to me

177
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,119
I will teach you with all my heart

178
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,840
There will be no possession

179
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,640
Would you like to

180
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,440
Follow me to learn

181
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,000
Disciple, thank you, master

182
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,159
Is to see me down and out now

183
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,440
Unwilling

184
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,000
Not so

185
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,239
That's unwilling to get involved in factional strife

186
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,800
Just to see you pleasing to the eye

187
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,119
I want to give you a few words

188
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
It's just a good relationship

189
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,839
If you wish

190
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
You can't call me sister too much in the future

191
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,479
But

192
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,800
Why

193
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,239
Yin Ziping is narrow-minded

194
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,319
Su Yuehua thinks highly of himself

195
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,520
Only you

196
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,280
Can treat everyone fairly and justly

197
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,319
Up and down the food bureau

198
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,560
Few people say you are wrong

199
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,880
This skill

200
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
It's not easy

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,079
But Wang Sishan hates me very much

202
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,520
This man

203
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,400
The pursuit is to drink to the best of the environment

204
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,479
What you want is one heart and one mind

205
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,760
She decided you weren't sincere the first time she saw you

206
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,560
She is too naive

207
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,400
In this harem

208
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,800
Where is the place where you can live by cooking

209
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,280
Likable

210
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,359
To live long

211
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,000
Then

212
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,959
Please ask the steward for advice

213
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,199
There are thousands of businesses in this world

214
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,439
Practitioners

215
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,359
Do you know what is the way to win

216
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,160
Difference

217
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,680
Difference

218
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,640
Purple Azolla

219
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:18,959
Trust me

220
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,000
Go ahead
