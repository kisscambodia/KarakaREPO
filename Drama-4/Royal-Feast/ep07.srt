1
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,879
Some people fish the village and oppress the people

2
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,479
A name will be erased from the official record

3
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,879
His head will be hung high in the firewood market

4
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,479
I reuse these people

5
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,159
Is to let every official

6
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,159
Hanging in the heart day and night

7
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,759
Always remember to be honest and be an official

8
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,199
Be kind to the people

9
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:51,880
Grandpa Emperor

10
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,640
Criminal law can naturally deter officials

11
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,720
But those are weak women

12
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,960
Zhanji

13
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,000
How many years have I succeeded to the throne

14
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,960
Always introspect from time to time

15
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,319
I just hope that one day

16
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,039
Wherever I subdue the people

17
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,679
Can live and work in peace and contentment and share peace

18
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,839
What I want

19
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,160
It is a real prosperous time

20
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,319
They are my eyes and my ears

21
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,759
Patrol the four sides and monitor the world for me

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,479
The government is so, so is the harem

23
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,039
My harem

24
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,559
I don't know how many other people's eyes and ears

25
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,520
And how many spies from other countries

26
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,679
Such a weak woman

27
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,960
I can't afford it

28
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,119
Your grandpa and grandchildren are worried about you

29
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,479
There are 26 people on trial this time

30
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,399
There will be crazy rumors of good people

31
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,000
Said you tortured a confession

32
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,640
Involving more than 2,000 people

33
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,119
Some people even said that you personally supervised the chop

34
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,399
Bloodstained Forbidden City

35
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,479
Grandchildren don't want to hear anyone

36
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,520
To tarnish your reputation

37
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,919
I don't want to hear anyone

38
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,440
Say you are not at all

39
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,640
I am the king of the world and the father of all peoples

40
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Twenty years on the throne

41
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,440
Never slack off early and late

42
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,919
Thoughts and thoughts

43
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,000
It is nothing more than the cold, warm and hungry of the people

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,479
The trivial matters in the palace are also personally supervised and cut

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,759
Am I that idle

46
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,240
The person who preaches ballads is really the light of rats' eyes

47
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,000
Stupid

48
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,440
Although it is a rumor,

49
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,679
But if you let Yu climb and bite again,

50
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,479
I'm afraid more innocent people will be implicated

51
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,759
Grandpa Emperor

52
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,479
Can you look at your grandchildren's points

53
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,119
Severely punish the first evil

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Release the others

55
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,279
Then

56
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,160
How to distinguish who is the first evil

57
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Who are the accomplices

58
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,960
Zhan Ji

59
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,039
Go back and read your book well and be your fault

60
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,840
In the future, Dechengye will

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
To live up to my high hopes for you

62
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:09,999
This little thing

63
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,360
It's not your business

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,120
Go home

65
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,599
It is the grandson who leaves

66
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,159
My Lord, she confessed

67
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,159
Who

68
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,360
It's a prince

69
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
Dare to slander the prince of the current dynasty

70
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:57,439
It was the prince who instructed me to kill the emperor

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,999
Behind the scenes is the present prince

72
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,919
Keep people well

73
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:06,719
I will enter the palace immediately

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Yes

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,080
Empress Zhuang Fei

76
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,879
Empress Zhuang Fei

77
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,360
Empress

78
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,479
Help me help me help me

79
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:48,999
Wait a minute

80
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:50,800
Here

81
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:52,919
This is water

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,800
And

83
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:58,999
This is fried rice

84
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,960
Empress

85
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
Fried rice is easy to store

86
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,680
Not easy to break

87
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,759
You put the rest on your body

88
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Don't let anyone find out

89
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,159
Good

90
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,520
Hurry up

91
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,039
Can you tell the Crown Princess for me

92
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,759
You tell her to talk to the emperor

93
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,159
I'm innocent

94
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,719
I was not involved in the rebellion

95
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,960
Empress

96
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,120
On weekdays, you

97
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,199
Be in the same room with Li Zhaoyi and Yu Meiren

98
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
Didn't you find anything unusual

99
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,280
I've always been kind to her

100
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:50,280
I don't know why she trapped me in injustice

101
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,039
Think about it carefully

102
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,840
She has been angry at every turn in the past two months

103
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,640
It's like a different person

104
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,599
I don't know

105
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,840
I don't understand either

106
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,280
Zi Jin

107
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,560
Go, go, go, go

108
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,599
No, don't go

109
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,439
Wait a minute

110
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,960
Don't leave without me

111
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
Empress, we will come again

112
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,680
Quick, quick, quick

113
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,999
Go

114
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,960
Ziliao, where have you been

115
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,520
The snacks I made were returned as they were

116
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,080
It's a good reprimand

117
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,719
If I had known this

118
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,159
I won't be on duty for you

119
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,599
You loser

120
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:04,319
Miss Yao is still going to trouble you this time

121
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
Your Highness can't persuade

122
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,119
I know

123
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,920
The more Grandpa Huang values me

124
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,280
The more I don't want people to talk in my ear

125
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,480
If I dissuade you

126
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
I'm afraid it will involve more

127
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,359
Your Highness

128
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,359
Perfunctory

129
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,480
Tell her to redo it

130
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,960
Yes

131
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,080
Wait

132
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,280
It's done. Let her deliver it in person

133
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,160
Your Highness, are you summoning her

134
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,439
Go quickly

135
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,160
Yes

136
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,199
There are rules for concubines in the palace according to their grades

137
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,559
Although Yu Meiren has no pet,

138
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,559
It won't be so frugal

139
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,080
Eat so little

140
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,640
This is to become immortal

141
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,520
Miss Yao

142
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,239
Why are you still wearing this dress?

143
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,319
Change clothes quickly. Change clothes

144
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,679
You're lucky Your Highness summoned you

145
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,319
Go quickly

146
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,799
Go quickly

147
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,720
Purple Azolla

148
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,319
Why are you staring at this

149
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,199
You go quickly

150
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,480
Quick, quick, quick

151
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,679
Your Highness, something happened to the East Palace

152
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,559
Miss Yao, slow down

153
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,119
Is it heavy? Let me hold it for you

154
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,319
Watch your step

155
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,199
Let me hold it for you

156
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:23,759
Miss Yao

157
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,400
Just a moment

158
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,600
Your Highness Your Highness

159
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,879
People are coming. People are coming

160
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,600
Your Highness has something urgent to talk about later

161
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,280
What is it

162
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,319
What is it

163
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:35,879
You guys

164
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,199
Hurry and follow it

165
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,080
Go, go, go

166
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,359
Miss Yao

167
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,879
Why don't you wait here first

168
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,199
Your Highness seems to have something to do

169
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,439
Wait a minute

170
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,119
It's father-in-law Yuan

171
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,319
You follow me and light me up

172
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,319
Quickly

173
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:48,759
Follow me. Hurry up. Hurry up

174
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,799
Your Royal Highness Temple can't make it

175
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,080
You get out of here

176
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,160
Your Highness Your Highness

177
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,480
Your Highness can't make it

178
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,119
Let go

179
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Or I'll strangle you first

180
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,359
Your Highness

181
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,600
Your Highness

182
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,280
Let go

183
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,879
Your Royal Highness Your Royal Highness

184
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,400
Your Highness

185
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,679
This is it

186
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,679
Absolutely not

187
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,359
Your Highness

188
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:37,400
Your Highness

189
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,600
Step down

190
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,840
Back off

191
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,439
You also give me back

192
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,520
Your Highness, what are you doing

193
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,759
Just in time you came

194
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,720
I have a few words to transmit to my father

195
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,600
Bother you to do it for me

196
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,319
For more than twenty years

197
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:02,040
Father led the army to the north

198
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,439
I have supervised the country four times

199
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,960
Vertical details and minor reasons

200
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,960
Dare not neglect

201
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
But my father believes in the rumors of adulterers

202
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,280
East Palace ministers are often imprisoned and don't say

203
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,999
I am even more afraid and treading on thin ice

204
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,640
Now

205
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,720
My father believed in Yu's formation of me

206
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,520
This, this, this

207
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,040
This is really unreasonable

208
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,280
People often say that

209
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,520
Son doesn't say father's fault

210
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,960
I've been holding it back for more than 20 years

211
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:40,280
I have to say this today

212
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:44,600
I know my father loves my second brother

213
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,439
Want to make him prince

214
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,319
I can put up with it

215
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,759
I can even make

216
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,799
But I have to say this today

217
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
You help me down first

218
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,879
Jun Haozhi

219
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,640
Then I will do it

220
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,040
Upward

221
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,720
Then the people follow it

222
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,319
But my father trusts the Royal Guards and the Neihuan

223
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,520
Yu Xia multi-purpose heavy code

224
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,199
In the long run

225
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,480
There must be more cruel officials in the court

226
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,160
Folk associations will attack the wind

227
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,640
This

228
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,080
This is very wrong

229
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,119
Help me up

230
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,359
Don't move

231
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,759
Your Highness, I am today

232
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,119
Your Highness

233
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,480
I

234
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,439
Don't, Your Highness

235
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,879
Your Highness, what are you doing

236
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,600
You also stand down

237
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
One more step forward and I'll die for you

238
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,559
No, no, no

239
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,720
Your Highness Your Highness

240
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,080
Think about it carefully

241
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,759
She has been angry at every turn in the past two months

242
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,600
It's like a different person

243
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,600
I don't know

244
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,759
I don't understand either

245
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,600
Although Yu Meiren has no pet,

246
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,640
It won't be so frugal

247
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,400
Eat so little

248
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,840
This is to become immortal

249
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,840
It's wrong. He's wrong

250
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,559
No, your highness, your highness

251
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,239
Your Highness

252
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,920
You

253
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:08,720
Back off

254
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,640
Don't come over here

255
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,239
You take a step forward now

256
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,520
I'll die for you to see

257
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,600
I'm coming

258
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,359
What will my father have to say

259
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,480
I will definitely convey it to Grandpa Huang truthfully

260
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:19,319
You

261
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,999
You, you still come to mad at me at this time

262
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,239
I'm just following my father's instructions

263
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,720
I didn't mean to annoy you

264
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,280
He he he

265
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,319
He's mad at me

266
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,840
He did it on purpose. He did it on purpose

267
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,199
Do you want me to die for you now

268
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:35,600
Your Highness

269
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,359
You child

270
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,679
Why are you fooling around like your father

271
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,679
How old are you

272
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
Still like a child

273
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,640
Dad has something to say. Come down and say it

274
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,320
I won't come down

275
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,759
Come down

276
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,999
No less

277
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,040
I-I haven't gone up yet

278
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,280
How can we talk about it

279
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,320
Your Highness

280
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,999
1

281
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,440
II

282
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,040
III

283
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,920
Your Highness

284
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Your Highness Your Highness

285
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,920
Your Highness

286
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,280
Your Highness, are you all right? Are you all right

287
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,200
Love Princess

288
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560
Scared me to death

289
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,520
It killed me

290
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,800
Father has nothing to do. I'll go back first

291
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,719
Love Princess

292
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,280
Your Highness

293
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,879
Since your highness is safe and sound,

294
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,920
My body also retired first

295
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,079
Your Highness, rest early

296
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,479
Your Highness, you scared me to death

297
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,359
You you

298
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,320
How can you thunder and not rain

299
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,079
I'm shouting here

300
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,440
Can you hear it outside the temple

301
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,560
Back to His Royal Highness the Prince

302
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,160
There was so much noise just now

303
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,400
I heard it naturally

304
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,239
Help me up

305
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,160
I just want the emperor to

306
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,680
I just want my father to hear me

307
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,800
My son is wronged

308
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:20,719
Tell them

309
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,079
Prepare meals at once

310
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm hungry

311
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes

312
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,320
Your Highness, what does this mean

313
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,719
I'm confused

314
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,560
Your Highness

315
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,239
Go and check Yu's family for me at once

316
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,239
Yes

317
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,800
Yuan Qi

318
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,800
Yuan Qi

319
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,239
Your Highness

320
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,079
Your Highness

321
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,200
The handmaiden stayed

322
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,680
No retention

323
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,921
Let's tear down the door later

324
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:40,561
Anyway, closing the door is useless

325
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:41,801
Yes

326
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,080
Lord You

327
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,041
Is this coming back to search for the palace maidservant who took the title again

328
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,561
Yu's confession

329
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:51,561
The Prince had ordered her to poison His Majesty's diet

330
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:54,480
Guanglu Temple Food Bureau is also involved

331
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,561
Meng Shang Shi

332
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,041
I'm sorry

333
00:20:57,561 --> 00:20:58,441
According to Daming Law

334
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:59,281
Conviction of officials

335
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:01,000
A formal trial is required to finalize the case

336
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,521
I respectfully ask the Holy Judgment

337
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,681
Inside the harem

338
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,080
Gong Zhengsi is in charge of picketing the Imperial Palace

339
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,681
Today, I am the female official of Zhengwupin Imperial Palace

340
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,321
Even if you want to interrogate and detain

341
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,681
Should be detained in Gongzhengsi

342
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:14,000
Instead of Zhenfu Prison

343
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,041
Why bother the Royal Guards

344
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,880
This kind of case can't be tried by Gong Zhengsi

345
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,681
Had to wronged Meng Shang to eat

346
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:22,441
Take away

347
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:23,201
Wait a minute

348
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:29,401
The sinner Yu Shi is the one who denounced me

349
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,000
Or the whole food bureau

350
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,561
It is natural that no one knows if they want to go against each other

351
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,600
Good

352
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:39,801
Since it's just me

353
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,480
Just imprison and interrogate me

354
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:42,641
Meng Shang Shi

355
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:43,561
Your Excellency

356
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,921
Nayu's family

357
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,080
Openly arguing with Guo Bianfei at the flower banquet

358
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,921
May be holding a grudge for a long time

359
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,161
Do not hesitate to frame the prince

360
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,080
Involve the whole food bureau

361
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,321
Please also learn from you that you should not be blinded by Yu's family

362
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,641
When will it be your turn to speak

363
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,161
Lord You

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,641
Shang Shi Bureau is in charge of court meals

365
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,480
It is the most important place in the palace

366
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:10,760
If you want to be detained,

367
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,000
Why don't you detain me?

368
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:13,321
Let Meng Shang eat first

369
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:15,041
I'm also the duty

370
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
Dare not neglect and indulge

371
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,201
I have to wronged three people

372
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,561
Take away

373
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:24,161
Rest assured

374
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,521
You have no real evidence at all

375
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
How can you take people away easily

376
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,681
Just because of a sinner's words

377
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,441
As of today

378
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,041
Present noble people's meals

379
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,641
Have to go through careful interrogation

380
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:35,201
If there is a flaw

381
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,641
It's not Masahiro Miyagi waiting for you

382
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,641
It's Zhenfu's prison

383
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:42,360
Trust me

384
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,360
You don't want to know

385
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,681
What kind of a place is that

386
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:49,360
Zi Jin

387
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
What shall we do

388
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,720
I haven't sent anything to Zhuang Fei for three days

389
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
They guard like this

390
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,240
We can't get out at all

391
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,921
I still have to think of another way

392
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:58,321
Don't be rash

393
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,441
Quickly

394
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:33,921
This

395
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,080
Have something to eat

396
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Even if you have to keep it

397
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:33,000
You can't stay water and rice all day, can you

398
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:43,921
Please

399
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,321
Come here

400
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:50,401
Walk over

401
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:53,681
Come

402
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:56,080
So fragrant

403
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:56,960
Come

404
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,161
Come on, give it to me, give it to me

405
00:25:59,161 --> 00:25:59,561
Come

406
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,321
Empress Zhuang Fei

407
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:53,441
Empress Zhuang Fei

408
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,240
Take down

409
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,760
How come every time I see you

410
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:11,840
Make me say the same thing

411
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:19,161
Take away

412
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:52,080
Your Excellency

413
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,760
It's just a little palace maid

414
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:55,041
Can't stand the scare

415
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:56,840
Take her for a walk in prison

416
00:27:57,681 --> 00:28:00,041
Tomorrow's confession is all ready

417
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,360
Is it

418
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,281
She can say whatever she wants her to say

419
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,161
Keep it verbatim

420
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,480
Your Majesty

421
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:40,480
The palace maid of Shangshi Bureau has confessed

422
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:42,720
Princess Zhuang was imprisoned after the incident

423
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,600
Meng Shangshi disobeyed the imperial edict

424
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,120
Private palace maidservants deliver meals

425
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,080
It can be seen that Yu's Zhuang Fei

426
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:49,641
There is indeed collusion between the Food Bureau

427
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,880
Just take what you said to me

428
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:54,760
Yu and others conspired against each other

429
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,240
When and where to poison

430
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,921
Say it one by one

431
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,521
Lord You

432
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,921
Don't inflict heavy punishment on me

433
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,641
What does your Lord ask the handmaiden to say

434
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,801
Handmaidens are willing to confess

435
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,240
Father, did you hear me

436
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,401
The Royal Guards used heavy punishment to persecute innocent people

437
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,041
My son is really wronged

438
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:19,401
This is the command

439
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:21,321
How dare you talk nonsense

440
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:25,921
Tell the truth

441
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,561
Lord You

442
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,120
He insisted

443
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:36,080
Don't say we were plotting to poison

444
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,681
I just haven't had time to do it yet

445
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,840
It coincides with Yu Niangniang's bedtime

446
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,921
This is the opportunity to set fire

447
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,600
Yu Niangniang

448
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,521
The handmaiden didn't say anything

449
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,080
Didn't say anything about your illness

450
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,801
The handmaiden really didn't say anything

451
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,441
Yu Niangniang

452
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:56,561
Handmaiden handmaiden didn't say anything

453
00:29:59,321 --> 00:29:59,880
Your Majesty

454
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,960
Yu Shi, she obviously harbored evil intentions

455
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,960
What's the disease

456
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,480
A palace maid who is still in the food bureau

457
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,921
How did you know about it

458
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:12,801
Handmaiden

459
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,600
Handmaiden

460
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:16,921
Shake what

461
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,080
What do you want to say clearly

462
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:20,401
Your Majesty makes decisions for you

463
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
Yes yes

464
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:24,960
The handmaiden thought

465
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,561
Recently

466
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,720
Yu Niangniang's food list has changed greatly

467
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,681
There are often palace maidservants taking honey and candied fruit

468
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,641
The palace people talked privately

469
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:40,880
They said that Yu Niangniang was strangely ill

470
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,080
Your Majesty

471
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,240
The handmaiden has just entered the palace

472
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,240
I don't even know the way to the palace

473
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,161
Lord You insisted on taking away the handmaiden

474
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:51,161
Ask what conspiracy

475
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,201
Handmaiden really doesn't know anything

476
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,480
Your Majesty, forgive your life. Your Majesty, forgive your life

477
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:57,161
Father

478
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,720
My son is really wronged

479
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,760
Your Majesty

480
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,760
I asked the Imperial Doctor to treat Yu in court

481
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:15,240
An audience with Imperial Doctor Xuan Sheng

482
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:19,921
What's the use of checking

483
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,401
Why not tell you

484
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:27,000
The prince wants to kill your majesty

485
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,240
Because he's tired of waiting

486
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,360
Can't wait to be emperor

487
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,760
I

488
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,240
Be left out for many years

489
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:44,760
Suffering from the slow treatment and bullying of the whole palace

490
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,641
I'm tired of living

491
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:48,760
Yu's

492
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,600
Your Majesty doesn't often see you

493
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,000
But treat you well

494
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,360
How can there be so much resentment

495
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,600
How can you be so vicious

496
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
Want to bury all of us with you

497
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,240
Princess Zhuang

498
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,360
Do you think your Majesty really dotes on you

499
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,561
We're just royal thrushes

500
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:11,161
Oriole

501
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,960
They will be released one day

502
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:17,720
But we

503
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,120
You can only boil until you grow old

504
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,201
Drop to tooth drop

505
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,681
Your Majesty

506
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,840
Your Majesty

507
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,240
Since I didn't mean it,

508
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:35,041
Why did you hurt my life, sire

509
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,240
Crazy woman

510
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,921
Chen Shengyin visits Your Majesty

511
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:52,521
Sheng Tai Yi

512
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,480
Please feel Yu's pulse

513
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,521
Yes

514
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,960
Check what to judge what

515
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,641
What's there to check

516
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,201
This pulse

517
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:26,161
This pulse is soft on the left

518
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:26,921
Right inch off

519
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,000
What exactly is the disease

520
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,041
From the pulse condition,

521
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:34,521
The patient has chest obstruction and heartache for more than three years

522
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,880
Nowadays, the medicine stone is ineffective

523
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:38,281
Time is running out

524
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,201
As for eating candied fruit

525
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:43,201
It must be heart failure and bitter taste

526
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:44,120
Your Majesty

527
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,561
You can kill me

528
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:48,041
Your Majesty, I beg you

529
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,321
You can kill me

530
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:49,960
Your Majesty

531
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,960
Your Majesty, you heard it with your own ears

532
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,240
Yu Shi, she has lost all hope

533
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,201
Holding the mind of dying with everyone

534
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:01,521
Male and female servants and others are wronged

535
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:02,801
Your Majesty's Sage

536
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:05,401
Return the innocence of male and female servants and concubines

537
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:07,281
Father

538
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,840
Such a terminally ill woman

539
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Crazy talk, crazy talk

540
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,201
Is it trustworthy

541
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,161
Even if my son finds someone to coordinate

542
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,921
How can you find such a precarious person

543
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,000
Is my son in the eyes of my father

544
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,681
Is it really a fool who is wanton and frivolous

545
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,561
Father

546
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:35,521
Who gave you the courage to frame the prince

547
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:36,240
Say

548
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,281
I can't let you bury me

549
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:43,720
What a pity

550
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:45,720
Prince Ye

551
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:47,960
Don't blame me

552
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,321
Blame your good side princess

553
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:53,761
She openly bullied

554
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:55,641
I'm a poor man

555
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,880
I have to come to settle accounts with you

556
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,961
As long as your East House falls

557
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,401
What vengeance do I have that I can't avenge

558
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:08,681
The more people I have on the road, the better

559
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,120
Yu Shi, you still refuse to tell the truth

560
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:21,641
Grandpa Emperor

561
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,201
A few days ago

562
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:25,800
Someone sent an altar of gold to Yu's home

563
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,040
And promised to take care of her parents for life

564
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,401
Yu knows that his life will not be long

565
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,840
He promised to deliberately set fire to the prince

566
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,360
Nowadays, witness and physical evidence

567
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:37,161
The eunuchs who spread the news inside and outside are waiting for the decree outside the temple

568
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:40,320
Who is the mastermind

569
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:43,241
What do you say, Uncle

570
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:48,681
Zhu Zhanji

571
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,401
What have I got to do with this

572
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,161
Grandpa Emperor

573
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:53,600
After inquiry

574
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,641
Someone recognized

575
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,840
The one who sent the gold was the chief attendant of Han Wangfu

576
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,800
Fracture

577
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,840
This is a naked structure

578
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,600
Father

579
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:06,961
I have never seen this woman before

580
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,761
I didn't send any gold to Yu's family

581
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:11,761
Father, you have to believe me

582
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:13,441
If I want to frame the prince,

583
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,280
Be sure to go unnoticed

584
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,120
How can people claim to be people in Han Wangfu

585
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,080
Isn't this waiting to be exposed

586
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,241
Someone must have framed the prince

587
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,520
I want to alienate our royal flesh and blood again

588
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,401
Father Ming Jian, father

589
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:30,161
Don't worry, uncle

590
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,560
Say it slowly if you have grievances

591
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,520
Can I not be in a hurry

592
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,360
Who can not be framed in a hurry

593
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,520
My son is really wronged

594
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,921
Father Ming Jian

595
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,161
Second uncle, don't make a gaffe in front of the temple

596
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,641
Zhanji, you believe in your uncle, don't you

597
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:48,800
Tell Grandpa Huang quickly

598
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,441
Second uncle is wronged

599
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,441
Wronged

600
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,360
That's enough

601
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,761
Send Princess Zhuang back to the palace first

602
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,040
Yu's prison will be retried in the future

603
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:06,401
Yes

604
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:09,560
Your Majesty still thinks the food bureau is innocent

605
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,161
Let it go together

606
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,441
Father Emperor Father Emperor

607
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:19,921
You believe me, don't you

608
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:21,040
Big Brother

609
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:26,441
The third child

610
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,401
The third child

611
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:39,560
Please stay, Lord You

612
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,961
What do you want from Your Highness

613
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,721
Lord You

614
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,040
Do you ever think

615
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,681
What's so weird about this thing

616
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,520
This is not a conspiracy at all

617
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,401
Yu's life will not be long

618
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,481
And resent the rudeness of the Eastern Palace concubine

619
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:57,001
Want to burn everything

620
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,360
Will frame the prince

621
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Involve innocent people

622
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,441
As for what to do with Hanwang

623
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:03,320
Since your majesty has not made a clear decree,

624
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:04,921
Nature can't be investigated

625
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Please forgive my grandson

626
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,080
How do I feel

627
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:10,040
Witness and material evidence

628
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,320
It's like everything is waiting for me

629
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
As long as the truth comes out

630
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:16,641
It is good that the prince is safe

631
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,840
His Royal Highness Taisun, Wei Chen, retired

632
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,481
Empress watch your step

633
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,560
Thank you for just

634
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,120
Let's go

635
00:38:58,441 --> 00:38:59,401
Why are you following me

636
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,320
Fuck off

637
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,761
Fuck off

638
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:09,840
Han Wang is so furious

639
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:11,280
What's the use

640
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:14,560
Release comes quickly

641
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,441
Look at you like this

642
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,441
It seems to have suffered a great injustice

643
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,040
How

644
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:24,280
Even you think I bought Yu's

645
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,161
Frame Prince

646
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,401
Isn't it

647
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:29,840
Buy off a terminally ill woman

648
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
To assassinate the father

649
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,001
Frame Prince

650
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:33,840
But also leave witness and physical evidence

651
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,560
In your heart

652
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,600
Am I so stupid

653
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:40,481
In this way

654
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,761
It's like someone deliberately alienated

655
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:44,360
Not Zhu Gaochi

656
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,481
It won't be Zhu Zhanji

657
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:47,600
Why

658
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:49,961
My eldest brother reads the book of sages

659
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,961
Believe in the art of leniency and saint

660
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,161
He can't do such a thing

661
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:56,401
As for the boy Zhu Zhanji,

662
00:39:57,241 --> 00:39:58,600
More shrewd than Big Brother

663
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,840
How could you try to frame me

664
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,600
What about bringing trouble to your biological father

665
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:06,800
That is, someone deliberately led him to verify

666
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:10,441
Who could this man be

667
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:28,120
Pay tribute

668
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,560
Inverse

669
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:37,681
If it were you

670
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:40,880
Pass by many times

671
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,401
His Royal Highness Han Wang didn't recognize his own son

672
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:44,600
How

673
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,280
I recognize it now

674
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:47,520
See this tombstone

675
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,040
What else can't I guess

676
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:51,360
Take a closer look at you

677
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,921
Not born like me at all

678
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:55,840
It's more like that bitch

679
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,520
Sovereign, Sovereign, calm down

680
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,360
Sovereign

681
00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:04,241
Bitch

682
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,600
King Wang Ye

683
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:08,721
Bitch

684
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,681
Mother

685
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:15,520
After your mother died

686
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,441
You sneaked out of the palace

687
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,441
I sent people to find nothing

688
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,921
For so many years

689
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,080
Your appearance and temperament have changed greatly

690
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,161
When I first saw you,

691
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:27,360
Or will you have doubts

692
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:29,120
It seems that seven years ago

693
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,921
The body in Jinan looks like you

694
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,280
It's also the maze of your cloth

695
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,840
The emperor went out in distress

696
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
You have been meritorious in rescuing the driver

697
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,280
Since then, he has been transferred to Beijing

698
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:44,161
Go all the way to the top

699
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,401
But how strict is the selection of Royal Guards

700
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:48,840
Did the emperor know for a long time

701
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,961
A maid gives birth to a child

702
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:53,961
Never got an audience with the emperor's grandfather

703
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,800
Who will know who I am

704
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,401
Then neither should you

705
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,520
For a woman who disobeys her husband

706
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,921
Designing to frame one's biological father

707
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,600
Now you know what it's like to be wronged

708
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,401
My mother was innocently wronged and had an affair with others

709
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,641
I don't even have a chance to defend myself

710
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,241
She is more wronged than you

711
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,481
A hundred times more painful than you

712
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:36,921
Bastard

713
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,681
You can really ignore your father

714
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:43,241
Don't forget

715
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,800
The blood on you is mine

716
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,001
Is it

717
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:51,800
You don't listen to rumors

718
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,360
Confessed that my mother had an affair with someone

719
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:55,280
Maybe

720
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,201
I'm a bastard, too

721
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,921
After the death of Zheng

722
00:43:02,921 --> 00:43:03,880
I once regretted it

723
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,241
It was too rash at first

724
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,280
I sent people everywhere looking for you

725
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:10,001
I searched all over the country

726
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,481
You hate me

727
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:13,201
I don't blame you

728
00:43:14,681 --> 00:43:16,320
You have been very intelligent since you were a child

729
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,280
Has always been my father's favorite child

730
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,040
If it weren't for hindering etiquette

731
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,320
You should have been the son of my Han Wangfu

732
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:02,560
Pay tribute

733
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:08,560
If you don't want to go back with me,

734
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,921
I don't force it either

735
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,761
I hope one day

736
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,681
Can you call me Father yourself

737
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,441
Go ahead

738
00:44:32,201 --> 00:44:33,360
I have something to interrogate alone

739
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,441
What I promised you has been done

740
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:45,481
What about what you promised me

741
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:55,840
Your younger siblings who were kicked out by your stepmother

742
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:57,721
I have asked someone to find it

743
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:00,001
And foster care in a family

744
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,641
They will grow up healthy and safe

745
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:06,120
As for the wolf-hearted man and woman

746
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,840
Will accompany you on the road naturally

747
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:15,961
I'm relieved

748
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,001
One more thing I don't understand

749
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,201
Say

750
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:24,560
You used me

751
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,441
Design and frame Hanwang

752
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:30,320
What is the intention?

753
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:33,080
Nature is

754
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,441
Back to my beloved father
