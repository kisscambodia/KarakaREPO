00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:44,800
Your Highness

2
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,040
Assassin

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,319
All well-trained dead men

4
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
Only two survivors left

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,839
One dies after being jailed

6
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,040
only one left

00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm looking down on his line.

9
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,599
As for the New Year's Day

10
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,919
Records of entering and leaving the palace

11
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,800
Hundred Opera Troupe Singing and Dancing Artists

A total of six hundred and forty-three

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,199
All personnel are registered

15
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,360
It will take some time to check

16
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,679
What do you think

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,960
Your Highness

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,440
Who is the real culprit is revealed

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
If Your Majesty and the Prince

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
The servant dared to say something

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,039
Can't be separated from left and right

22
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,160
The handwriting of the two princes

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
ok ok

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,720
Don't keep taking these things

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,759
Come to disturb His Highness to recover from illness

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,559
Okay ah

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Afternoon has been delivered

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,919
what about her

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
still outside

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,559
His Royal Highness Hat

31
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,279
Mr. Mei

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,160
what happened last time

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,679
i am deeply disturbed

34
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,800
always looking for a chance

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,919
sorry to you

36
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,039
Meal for me

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
did you do it yourself

38
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,199
I see

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
meal went wrong

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,240
I'm to blame

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Please forgive me

42
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,160
these are enough

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,039
His Royal Highness has been insomnia lately

44
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,000
It is not advisable to put more ginseng in the soup

45
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,399
Too much tonic can also cause insomnia

46
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,600
Yao Dianshan

47
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,720
how do you know

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,080
Your Highness is not sleeping well

49
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,919
delivered lunch

50
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,440
Your Highness is not finished

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,759
Only the lily jujube soup has run out

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,639
It can be seen that it is for peace of mind

53
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,800
Your Highness

54
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:16,959
Your Highness

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
You don't have to worry about things in the courtroom

56
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,079
Just take it easy

57
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,040
Your Highness

58
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,040
How dare the slaves reveal

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,799
these things

60
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,640
Mr. Mei

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
You testify for the slaves

62
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,839
I just stepped on that threshold

63
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,399
smelled blood

64
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,079
Your Highness is pale

65
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,760
The sound is also weaker than before

66
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,480
Still don't hold on

67
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,920
It seems today

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,679
I can't visit my mother

70
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,760
so as not to be discovered

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
feel good today

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,640
come to a game

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,720
Your Highness

74
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,000
The minister's face may be dirty

75
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,160
You frequently look to the minister

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
Naturally, the minister must be misunderstood

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
or I am today

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,160
extraordinarily handsome

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,839
graceful

80
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,239
His Highness finally smiled

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,480
Weekday ministers enter the door

82
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,839
Your Highness always smiles

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,239
Today since I crossed that threshold

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,399
Your Highness has never shown her face

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,959
The minister almost thought

86
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,679
Where did you offend Your Highness?

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,519

88
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,119
are you married

89
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:04,799
Mr. Mei

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,600
let's go

91
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,720
The doctor has already said

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,399
won't let you get up

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,079
what about you

94
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,000
don't listen to him

95
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,679
This is just great

96
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,399
The wound opened again

97
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,320
you for

98
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Don't let the queen be worried

99
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,279
still covering the wound

100
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,679
let others become

101
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,959
big hero rescue

102
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
what's the matter

103
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
Just some skin injuries

104
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,920
how precious

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
go get my book

106
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,760
Your Highness

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,200
Your Highness

108
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,880
Shang Food Bureau came to deliver dim sum

109
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,920
at your command

110
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,040
bring people in

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,760
when did i order

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,480
let her in

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,359
Yes

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,440
The slaves greet His Royal Highness the Prince

115
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,079
The afternoon meal in the palace was almost untouched

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,399
Meng Shangshi asked his servants

117
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,519
bring some pastries

118
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,959
you're awake

119
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,200
don't have to get up

120
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,959
I just came to see you

121
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:30,880
apprehensive

122
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,840
They said no need to be polite

123
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:34,960
are you hurt

124
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,200
Prince Xie

125
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,840
Do not

126
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,280
yes i want to thank you

127
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
Escort is a matter of ministers

128
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,479
Don't dare to say thank you to the prince

129
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,559
You protected the emperor for me

130
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,559
fulfilled the responsibility of the son of man

131
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,039
should be thankful

132
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,320
but

133
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,840
In the past, ministers only acted on orders

134
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Occasionally guilty

135
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,200
Also looking forward to His Royal Highness Haihan

136
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,479
thank you so much

137
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,840
I didn't come to see you

138
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,280
came to kill you

139
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,799
Grandpa said

140
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,159
you know the military

141
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,400
change with military

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,599
Suppress bandits

143
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,520
Remarkable achievements

144
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,880
I thought your ambition was only martial arts

145
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,559
But now it seems

146
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,919
This room full of classics

147
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,799
Landscape Travel Notes

148
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,599
I just knew

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
you dabble

150
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,200
lofty aspirations

151
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,679
The emperor suspects that his ministers have poor knowledge

152
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,840
Order the minister to read more

153
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,479
Nai Hechen is a warrior

154
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,520
Poetry and songs are really unbearable

155
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,400
But find some books to fill the door

156
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,799
Make the prince laugh

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,679
Yes

158
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,280
nature

159
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,159
You adult

160
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,239
His Royal Highness

161
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:49,640
nothing more

162
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Let's talk another day

163
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
Congrats to His Royal Highness

164
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,479
Why is Eunuch Liu here?

165
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,159
You adult

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,159
take it

167
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,000
The emperor bestowed upon you

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
death-free gold

169
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,880
The slaves and servants of the adults ordered to give meals

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,159
Your Majesty's decree

171
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,880
You are seriously injured

172
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,760
Free gift

173
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,039
Put it here, you go first

174
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,159
Not yet congratulations, Mr. You

175
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,039
a blessing in disguise

176
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,440
gifted

177
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
Not to mention the death-free gold medal

178
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,039
I heard that Prince Lian

179
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,159
They all came to visit

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,359
Royal gift from Emperor Taizu

181
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,239
The hero of the Danshu iron coupon is honorable

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,719
All died of treason and no one was spared

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
don't you curse me

184
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,880
today's day

185
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,559
The name of benevolence spreads all over the world

186
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,679
Your blood will not be shed in vain

187
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,239
Yes

188
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,039
tell a joke

189
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,919
Why should you be angry?

190
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,719
From now on, follow this recipe

191
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,200
Cooking for His Majesty

192
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,359
forgot your promise

193
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,679
rest assured

194
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
not poison

195
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,159
go

196
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,039
What's up

197
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,679
do not move

198
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,599
don't do superfluous

199
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,679
young and naive

200
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,440
always hope to meet one

201
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,159
someone who can bandage my wounds

202
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,400
Too bad it didn't wait

203
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,599
today

204
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,239
Just let me take care of my business for a while.

205
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,479
then i'm luckier than you

206
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,239
i waited

207
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,679
son

208
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,599
son wake up

209
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,799
closed one there

210
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,840
guilty woman

211
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,440
As for what crime she committed

212
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,119
why are you locked there

213
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,559
how long will it be closed

214
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,239
Nobody knows

215
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm curious

216
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,039
How could anyone be in jail?

217
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,799
still so nosy

218
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
So I disguised as a beggar

219
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,400
want to see her

220
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,359
what kind of person

221
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,799
Freshly baked buns

222
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,200
steaming hot buns

223
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,440
gadgets gadgets

224
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,320
sachet sachet

225
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Sugar-coated haws

226
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,520
when i found the world

227
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,039
When there are such fools

228
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:37,640
I think

229
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
no matter what crime she committed

230
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,159
I want to set her free

231
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,000
So did you see her last?

232
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,719
no

233
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,359
The food is cold

234
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,719
eat first

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,680
Mr. Mei

236
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,359
Please
free at kisskh.me


237
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,040
Mr. Mei

238
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,359
His Highness invites ministers to a small gathering

239
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,439
I thought it was a joke

240
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,400
I didn't expect His Highness to be so meticulous

241
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,199
prepared meals

242
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,439
It's Chen's favorite food

243
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
That minister was disrespectful

244
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,119
Your Highness

245
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,520
It's the food bureau that has a heart

246
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,920
Back to His Highness

247
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,359
His Highness ordered a banquet for Yushi Mei

248
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,880
Shang Food Bureau dare not neglect

249
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Shui Xin has poems

250
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,640
Don't wait for full forest frost to ripen

251
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,079
Steamed for Dongting Incense

252
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,119
This is Dong Ting

253
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,359
Mr. Mei

254
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,319
This is made of chopped lotus

255
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,560
And orange leaves

256
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,520
with rice flour and honey

257
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,280
Finally, wrap in orange leaves

258
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,800
steamed pastries

259
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,640
Sure enough

260
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,319
The lingering scent of oranges

261
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,520
When I was young, I read the section on Shizi Soup

262
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:17,439
curious for a while

263
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,079
also took

264
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,479
Cooking with stones in the clear spring

265
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,640
The so-called spring stone gas in the book

266
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,040
I can't understand

267
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,800
It cost a lot of firewood

268
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,119
Mr. Mei can really joke

269
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,400
The reader is so arty

270
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
isn't it funny

271
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,000
Mr. Mei

272
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,400
Su Yijian was drunk in the Song Dynasty

273
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,359
Waking up thirsty in the middle of the night

274
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,839
See a pickle jar buried in the snow

275
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,040
drink it

276
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,680
I thought it was a wonder in the world

277
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:46,839
That sour soup

278
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,400
How to compare dragon liver and phoenix gallbladder

279
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,520
But that's what it said

280
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,119
no taste

281
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,599
palatable jean

282
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,400
The ancients eat jade drink dew

283
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
Probably the same

284
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,599
It's boring in this house

285
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:04,760
go outside

286
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:05,800
Yes

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,719
what are you doing

288
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
take it outside

289
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,000
Hidden set

290
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,079
take it out

291
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,800
slow down

292
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,560
what is this dish

293
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,479
this

294
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,479
This is a pigeon

295
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,439
This yellow croaker

296
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,000
Can imitate the taste of crab meat

297
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,439
you have to talk to me

298
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,040
Your Highness

299
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,400
have a cup of hot tea

300
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,280
warm stomach

301
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,319
Mr. Mei

302
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,959
Don't let His Highness wait long

303
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,040
how

304
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,280
Your Highness is angry

305
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,439
It's all the minister's fault

306
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,359
Talking with Yao Dianshan is too speculative

307
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,319
correct

308
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I heard that Yao Dianshan is proficient in medicinal formulas

309
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,719
I happen to have something to ask

310
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,079
Mr. Mei is serious

311
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,439
There is something to command

312
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:07,760
I

313
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,640
Your Highness

314
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,040
Your Highness has been feeling unwell recently.

315
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,839
How can you sit in the vent?

316
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,000
Your Highness

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
let's move in

318
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Yao Dianshan

319
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,560
this world

320
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
heart-healthy diet

321
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,079
I think His Highness is very ill.

322
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Mr. Mei

323
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,920
Your Highness is heartbroken

324
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,199
I remember one more urgent matter

325
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,199
Please plead guilty to His Highness on my behalf

326
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll go first

327
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,199
Mr. Mei

328
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,359
This painting is not finished yet

329
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,079
come back tomorrow

330
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,119
what are you doing

331
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,599
move in

332
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,239
Hidden set

333
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,719
stop

334
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:23,199
Mr. Mei

335
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:23,839
please stay

336
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,520
you slow down

337
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,239
stop running

338
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,000
catch her

339
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:42,880
what are you doing

340
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,680
give her

341
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,000
I heard Yao Dianshan say you are in the palace

342
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:53,640
I have always

343
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,839
Carry this purse with you

344
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,439
This is the salary the restaurant should give you

345
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,119
you were young

346
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,439
I'm afraid you're messing around

347
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,520
fall into theft

348
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,160
I've been saving for you

349
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,359
Now back to the original owner

350
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,839
I'm leaving
free at kisskh.me


351
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,920
Your Highness, please have a meal

352
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,640
you play the piano to me

353
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,280
Your Highness

354
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,359
slave's hand

355
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,680
I can't play the piano now

356
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,359
Then I play the piano, you come and listen

357
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,160
slaves dare not

358
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,520
His Royal Highness is not healed

359
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,760
How dare you overwork yourself

360
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,040
Yes

361
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,239
i forgot

362
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,040
He is also good at piano

363
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,839
when you want to listen to the piano

364
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,359
Of course someone will caress you

365
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,560
send her out

366
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:08,959
Yes

367
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,239
List

368
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,040
Eunuch Chen

369
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,680
What did your Highness mean just now?

370
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,239
Yao Dianshan

371
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,359
I don't want to blame innocent you

372
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,760
willing to keep silent

373
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
so don't ask

374
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,040
how is your highness

375
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,079
you don't know

376
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
How could he bear to break his heart?

377
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,599
I break the heart of Your Highness

378
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,239
what did i do

379
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,079
I have been with His Highness since childhood

380
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,160
Your Highness will always be

381
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,359
The look of high spirits

382
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,239
never saw him

383
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,359
so disheartened

384
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,400
you

385
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
you are too much

386
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,479
I'm too much

387
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,040
nothing more

388
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,959
That's not what I said

389
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,479
You're better off

390
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,280
His Highness ordered

391
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,839
let me take you back myself

392
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:38,920
please

393
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,160
Eunuch Chen

394
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,599
what did i do

395
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,439
Please

396
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:08,880
Sheng imperial doctor

397
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,880
please

398
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,040
Yes

399
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
what does this mean

400
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,520
every day

401
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,199
Physician Sheng will heal you

402
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,400
until your hand heals

403
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,160
Your Highness's orders have been brought to me

404
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,040
just say goodbye

405
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,920
how

406
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,000
guilty

407
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,000
why are you guilty

408
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,560
This girl is rude

409
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,439
but hit me with words

410
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,800
I would have put my heart to the bright moon

411
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:32,520
Who knows that the bright moon shines on the ditch

412
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,920
You

413
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,760
the word is used here

414
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,040
But it's not right

415
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,439
voila

416
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:44,800
Give me

417
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,359
I don't know how to draw

418
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,640
But it was painted so carefully

419
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,199
It can be seen that the other party is very affectionate.

420
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,000
Who is not impressed by this?

421
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,560
i am not impressed

422
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,520
you have a heart of stone

423
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,319
this is me

424
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll leave what ruby

425
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,599
Emerald

426
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,760
emerald opal

427
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,760
won't stay

428
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,079
What the hell is this?

429
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,640
what is this

430
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,199
Yin Ziping

431
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,319
this purse

432
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,040
But for men

433
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,079
who is this

434
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,800
Zijin, give it back to me

435
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,000
You tell me

436
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,119
give it back to me

437
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,520
who is this man

438
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,560
give it back to me

439
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,239
tell me to give it back to you

440
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:40,800
give it back to me

441
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,760
I'll tell you again

442
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,439
you give me back

443
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:44,640
who is this

444
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
you give me back

445
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,520
Zijin

446
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,920
give it back to me

447
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I'll give it back to you

448
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:52,800
who

449
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,040
give it back to me

450
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,680
ok ok ok

451
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,760
for you

452
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,560
lighter

453
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,119
my hand

454
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,479
Breech birth

455
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,839
His Royal Highness is not healed

456
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,439
how can your majesty let you now

457
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,599
Are you going to Nanjing?

458
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,719
Jin Yiwei has found out

459
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,280
intermediary with assassin

460
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,640
when they arrive

461
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,959
People have committed suicide

462
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,319
But the identity of that person

463
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,119
very unusual

464
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,760
Do you remember

465
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,199
i was eight

466
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,560
Grandpa himself

467
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,319
From the civilian levy army avant-garde young army

468
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,199
follow me to practice martial arts

469
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
He was a soldier in the infantry

470
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,319
This is clearly a trap

471
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:52,920
How can your majesty believe

472
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,040
such nonsense

473
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,359
This man not only divides our father and son

474
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,319
He also managed to transfer me out of Beijing

475
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,959
It's heartbreaking

476
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,479
Your Highness, please have a meal

477
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,119
He is upright

478
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,199
strong character

479
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,640
However, those who are strong are easy to break

480
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,160
Too early to get involved in officialdom

481
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,599
not necessarily a good thing

482
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,280
I will find a way

483
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
let him out

484
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,680
practice for a few years

485
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,079
wait for him to be full-fledged

486
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,239
another day

487
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,959
Must be the pillar of the country

488
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,520
He has the world and the country in his heart

489
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,760
tend to be lenient

490
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,599
self-discipline

491
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,839
especially with family

492
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,640
Constraints will be too strict

493
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
I'm afraid you won't get used to it

494
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,839
correct

495
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,599
I forgot

496
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,319
you are so nice

497
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,079
how could he tell you

498
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,479
Your Highness

499
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,640
what do you mean

500
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,479
Aren't you going to leave the palace?

501
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
Your Highness wants to let me leave the palace

502
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,760
But the queen

503
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,680
I have my own way

504
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,959
nothing to do with others

505
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,959
Your Highness did not lie to me

506
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
but why

507
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,479
I haven't seen you in a long time

508
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,640
laugh so happy

509
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,359
At least he can make you laugh

510
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,640
Wait for your future husband and wife to follow

511
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,760
harmonious

512
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,640
do not know

513
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,199
Will you still remember this study?

514
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,160
will you remember me

515
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,239
His Highness said that he

516
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,119
Who is it

517
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,719
let's go

518
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,079
Otherwise I'll go back

519
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,760
Your Highness allows me to go out of the palace to marry

520
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,439
But no matter how good that person is

521
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,760
but not my sweetheart

522
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,640
who is your sweetheart

523
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,800
no one

524
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,719
Your Highness

525
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,239
This Guiqi Steamed Chicken

00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,760
And stewed chicken with astragalus

528
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,160
People with blood loss after illness

530
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,640
I know you have a bad appetite lately

531
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,719
can use some

532
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,920
Great for your injury

533
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,560
Said you don't care about me

534
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,640
Your Highness has misunderstood

535
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,920
It's a prescription prescribed by Imperial Physician Sheng.

536
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,239
we are just

537
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,479
Just make meals

538
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,319
Your Highness

539
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,199
Sheng Taiyi knows

540
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,680
Your injury has not healed

541
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,160
It is best to take the medicine with meals

542
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Therefore, today ordered people to bring medicinal food

543
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,479
This Sheng Yin

544
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,839
so confused

545
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,160
Mingming told you to prepare meals

546
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,160
But ask someone to send it again

547
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,560
The slaves retire

548
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,479
Ali

549
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,760
you step back

550
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,239
your highness

551
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,919
you don't want to say

552
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,239
i don't force you

553
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,199
anyway

554
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,560
I can't bother you for a few days

555
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,959
I'm going to Nanjing soon

556
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,000
Your Highness

557
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
your injury is not healed

558
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,479
Don't overwork yourself

559
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,199
This is the father's order

560
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,399
This is the fault of the prince

561
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,800
It's obviously my father who is suspicious of me

562
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,479
why is it my fault

563
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,959
Your Highness wishes father and son reconciliation

564
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,760
You should let go of the barriers

565
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,239
Sincerely to the Emperor

566
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,439
show your sincerity

567
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,000
you thought i didn't try

568
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,520
every time

569
00:34:59,239 --> 00:34:59,879
Father will take me

570
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,439
Rejected thousands of miles away

571
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,239
perhaps

572
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,520
It's that His Highness used the wrong method.

573
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,399
well done

574
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,399
Hidden set

575
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,199
can i today

576
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,520
go with you to deliver meals

577
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,879
When was the Shang Food Bureau so unruly?

578
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
a small meal

579
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,600
I also want to enter the Qianqing Palace

580
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,159
don't quit

581
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,280
Souji Zen

582
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,639
Meng Shangshi is slightly infected with wind and cold today

583
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,399
Can't go to Qianqing Palace to deliver meals

584
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,840
I just want to help Fang Dianshan

585
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,239
It's time to deliver

586
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,959
His Majesty

587
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,320

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,879
From Lin'an City in Southern Song Dynasty

00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,879
Made with cheese and cane sugar

590
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,439
Oysters are often called abalone

591
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
so this oyster-shaped snack

592
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,239
abalone

593
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,639
This porridge is good

594
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,399
The slaves are in the fire room

595
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,080
Cultivated chamomile seedlings for porridge

596
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,560
Refreshing and appetizing

597
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,760

598
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,239
This is the taste of hometown

599
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,919
Nanjing calls this chrysanthemum brain

That's a lot of gain

603
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,439
The last time was the reckless servant girl

604
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,439
Your Majesty's forgiveness

605
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,040
father emperor

606
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,760
Your Highness be careful

607
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,679

609
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,919

00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,199
Your Majesty forgives the slaves

611
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,399
The slaves are grateful

612
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,760
The slave is listening to the doctor

613
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:48,919
From the Shangyuan Banquet

614
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
His Majesty was frightened

615
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,080
dizzy all the time

616
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,280
This reminds me of chamomile seedlings

617
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,600
Can cure dizziness headache

618
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,199

The imperial concubine is also beside

625
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,840
That's relieved

626
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,679
