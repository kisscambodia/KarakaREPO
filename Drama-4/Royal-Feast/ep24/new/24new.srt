455
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,798
Your Highness has not recovered from his injuries

456
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,398
How can Your Majesty let you now

457
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:41,558
Leave for Nanjing

458
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,678
Royal Guards have found out

459
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,239
The middleman who made contact with the assassin

460
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:47,599
When they arrived,

461
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,918
People have committed suicide

462
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,278
But the identity of that man

463
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:51,078
Very unusual

464
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:52,719
Do you remember

465
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:54,158
When I was eight years old

466
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:55,519
Grandpa Huang himself

467
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,278
Recruiting government troops from the people, avant-garde young troops

468
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,158
Follow me to practice martial arts and train soldiers

469
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,479
He used to be a soldier in the young army

470
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,278
This is clearly a structure

471
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:04,879
How can Your Majesty believe

472
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:05,999
What about this nonsense

473
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,318
This man not only alienates our father and son

474
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:11,278
And tried to transfer me out of Beijing

475
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:12,918
His heart can be punished

476
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,438
Please take your highness to dinner

477
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,078
He is a man of integrity

478
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,158
Strong character

479
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:09,599
However, those who are rigid are easy to fold

480
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:12,119
Get involved in officialdom too early

481
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:13,558
Is not necessarily a good thing

482
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:15,239
I'll find a way

483
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:16,839
Let him out

484
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:18,639
Exercise for a few years

485
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,038
Treat him with full wings

486
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:21,198
Someday

487
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,918
It must be the pillar of the country

488
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,479
He cares about the world and his home country

489
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,719
Often lenient with others

490
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:30,558
Be strict with oneself

491
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:32,798
Especially when it comes to family

492
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:34,599
The constraints will be too strict

493
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,239
I'm afraid you won't get used to it

494
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:39,798
That's right

495
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:41,558
I forgot

496
00:31:42,438 --> 00:31:43,278
You're so nice

497
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,038
How could he say you

498
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,438
Your Highness

499
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,599
What exactly do you mean

500
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:52,438
Aren't you leaving the palace

501
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:54,759
Your Highness wants to release me from the palace

502
00:31:57,798 --> 00:31:58,719
But the Empress

503
00:31:58,719 --> 00:31:59,639
I have my own way

504
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,918
Have nothing to do with others

505
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,918
Your Highness didn't deceive me

506
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:06,719
But why

507
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,438
I haven't seen you for a long time

508
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:09,599
Laugh so happily

509
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:13,318
At least he can make you laugh

510
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:17,599
Waiting for your husband to sing along with your wife in the future

511
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:18,719
And harmonious

512
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:20,599
Don't know

513
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,158
Will you still remember this study

514
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,119
Will you remember me

515
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:27,198
His Highness said he was

516
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,078
Who the hell is it

517
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,678
Let's go

518
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,038
Or I'll go back on my word

519
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,719
Your Highness promised me to leave the palace and marry

520
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,398
But no matter how good that person is,

521
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:42,719
But not my sweetheart

522
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:47,599
Who is your sweetheart

523
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:55,759
It's nobody

524
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:01,678
Your Highness

525
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,198
This steamed chicken made by Guiqi

526
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:06,599
It is made of Angelica sinensis

527
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:08,719
And chicken stewed with roasted Astragalus membranaceus

528
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:11,119
People with loss of qi and blood after illness

529
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:11,959
Use the best

530
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,599
I know you have a bad appetite recently

531
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,678
You can use some

532
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:17,879
It is of great benefit to your injury

533
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:20,519
And said you didn't care about me

534
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,599
Your Highness misunderstood

535
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:24,879
It's a prescription prescribed by Dr. Sheng Tai

536
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:26,198
We're just

537
00:33:26,198 --> 00:33:27,438
It's just cooking according to the prescription

538
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,278
Your Highness

539
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,158
Dr. Sheng knows

540
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:45,639
Your injury has been delayed

541
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:48,119
Diet is the best way to dispense medicine

542
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,599
Therefore, I ordered people to send medicated diet today

543
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:00,438
Where is this Shengyin

544
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:01,798
What an old fool

545
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:04,119
Clearly told you to prepare meals

546
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:06,119
And asked someone to send it again

547
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,519
Handmaiden retires

548
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:17,438
Ali

549
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:20,719
You guys stand down

550
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,198
It's your highness

551
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,878
You don't want to say

552
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,198
I won't force you

553
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,158
Anyway

554
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,519
I don't have a few days to bother you either

555
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:40,918
I will go to Nanjing soon

556
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:43,959
Your Highness

557
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,039
Your injury is not healed

558
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,438
Don't overwork yourself

559
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,158
This is my father's order

560
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:52,358
This is the prince's fault

561
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:57,759
It is obviously my father who suspects me

562
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,438
Why is it my fault

563
00:35:00,638 --> 00:35:01,918
Your Highness wants father and son to make up

564
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,719
You should let go of the estrangement

565
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,198
Sincerely to the emperor

566
00:35:05,198 --> 00:35:06,398
Show your heart

567
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:08,959
You think I haven't tried

568
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,479
But every time

569
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:11,838
My father put me

570
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:13,398
Keep it away thousands of miles away

571
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:16,198
Maybe

572
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:18,479
Is that your highness used the wrong method

573
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:32,358
Well done

574
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:35,358
Recipe canon meal

575
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,158
Can I do it today

576
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:38,479
Go to the meal with you

577
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,838
When was the food bureau so unruly

578
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:43,319
A small palm meal

579
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:44,559
I also want to enter Ganqing Palace

580
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,118
Don't step down yet

581
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,239
Sosur meal

582
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,598
Meng Shangshi is slightly dyed with wind and cold today

583
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,358
You can't go to Ganqing Palace to deliver food

584
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:54,799
I just want to help Fang Dianshan

585
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,198
It's time to deliver food

586
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:47,918
Your Majesty

587
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:49,279
This snack

588
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:50,838
Originated from Lin'an City in Southern Song Dynasty

589
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:53,838
It is made of cheese and sucrose

590
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,398
Oysters are often called abalone

591
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,519
So this oyster-shaped snack

592
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:00,198
It is called abalone snail

593
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:08,598
This porridge is good

594
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,358
Handmaiden is a fire room

595
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:13,039
Cultivated chamomile seedlings cook porridge

596
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,519
The taste is refreshing and appetizing

597
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,719
Of course I know

598
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:20,198
This is the taste of hometown

599
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,878
Nanjing calls this chrysanthemum brain

600
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:26,918
Eat as soup

601
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:30,158
You recently

602
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,519
This benefit is really not small

603
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,398
Last time it was handmaiden recklessness

604
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,398
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

605
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:44,999
Father

606
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:45,719
Your Highness, be careful

607
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,638
It was all an unintentional loss

608
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:50,878
I won't blame you

609
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:51,878
Avoid

610
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,158
Your Majesty forgives the handmaiden

611
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:57,358
Handmaiden Thanksgiving

612
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,719
Handmaiden is listening to the Imperial Doctor

613
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:00,878
Since the banquet in Shangyuan,

614
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,239
Your Majesty was frightened

615
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:05,039
Be dizzy all the time

616
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:07,239
This reminds me of chamomile seedlings

617
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,559
Can treat vertigo and headache

618
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,158
This is the courage to try

619
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:11,799
Scared, huh

620
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,039
The handmaiden is really frightened

621
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:15,118
Hiding in the corner all the time

622
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:16,039
Trembling

623
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,158
Later I saw

624
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:18,519
The Imperial Concubine Empress is also next to her

625
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,799
This is a relief

626
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:24,638
Save the driver quickly

627
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:25,398
Rescue driver

628
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:27,319
Protect the Emperor

629
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:34,039
Your Majesty

630
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:37,799
Your Majesty

631
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,239
Guo Guifei asked for an audience

632
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:43,319
Be absent

633
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:45,598
Yes

634
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,079
I'm going to the school yard this afternoon

635
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,678
Send dinner there

636
00:39:00,878 --> 00:39:01,559
Yes

637
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:32,678
Father

638
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:43,079
Aren't you leaving for Nanjing

639
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:44,279
Why haven't you started yet

640
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:46,319
My son prepared a meal

641
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,000
Let's have dinner together

642
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:49,639
No need
