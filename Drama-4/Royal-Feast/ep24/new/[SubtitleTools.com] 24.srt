1
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:44,800
Your Highness

2
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,040
An assassin

3
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,319
They are all carefully trained dead men

4
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
Only two people were left alive

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,839
One person died of serious injuries after being imprisoned

6
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,040
There is only one person left

7
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,519
Royal Guards

8
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,040
Is following his line down

9
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,599
As for the last yuan day,

10
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,919
Records of entering and leaving the palace

11
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,800
Hundred troupe song and dance artists

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,959
Craftsmen from the Ministry of Industry and the Supervisory Bureaus of Neifu

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,599
A total of 643 people

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,199
All personnel are registered

15
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,360
It will take some time to check

16
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,679
What do you think

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,960
Your Highness

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,440
Who is the real murderer is obvious

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
If Your Majesty and the Prince

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
The handmaiden dared to say

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,039
Can't get away from left and right

22
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,160
The handwriting of two princes

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Come on, come on

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,720
Don't keep taking these things

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,759
To disturb your highness for illness

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,559
Can you do it?

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Your Highness, lunch has arrived

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,919
Where is she

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
It's still out there

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,559
Your Highness Hat

31
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,279
Lord Mei

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,160
What happened last time

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,679
I am deeply disturbed

34
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,800
Always looking for opportunities

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,919
I apologize to you

36
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,039
Meals for me

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
Did you make it yourself

38
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,199
That's why

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
There is something wrong with the meal

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,240
I am to blame

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I hope you will forgive me

42
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,160
That's enough

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,039
His Highness has suffered from insomnia recently

44
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,000
More ginseng should not be put in the soup

45
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,399
Excessive tonic is also prone to insomnia

46
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,600
Yao canon meal

47
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,720
How do you know

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,080
Your Highness didn't sleep well

49
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,919
Lunch delivered in the past

50
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,440
Your Highness hasn't used it up

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,759
Only lily jujube soup is used up

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,639
It can be seen that it is for peace of mind

53
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,800
Your Highness

54
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:16,959
Your Highness

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
You don't have to worry about things in court

56
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,079
Let's relax and recuperate

57
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,040
Your Highness

58
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,040
How dare a handmaiden reveal it

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,799
These things

60
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,640
Lord Mei

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
You testify for the handmaiden

62
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,839
I just stepped into that threshold

63
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,399
I smell a breath of blood

64
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,079
His Royal Highness is pale

65
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,760
The voice is weaker than before

66
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,480
Or don't hold on

67
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,040
Yeah

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,920
It seems that today

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,679
I can't visit my mother

70
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,760
So as not to be seen through

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
In a good mood today

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,640
Have a round

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,720
Your Highness

74
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,000
Can I have dirt on my face

75
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,160
You frequently look at me

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
I naturally have to misunderstand

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Or I am today

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,160
Extremely heroic and natural and unrestrained

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,839
Extraordinary charm

80
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,239
His Highness finally smiled

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,480
On weekdays, I enter the door

82
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,839
Your Highness always smiles at each other

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,239
Today, since stepping over that threshold,

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,399
Your Highness has never shown his face

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,959
I almost thought

86
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,679
Where did you offend your highness

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,519
Shaoyuan

88
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,119
Are you married

89
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:04,799
Lord Mei

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Let's go

91
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,720
The Imperial Doctor has already said it

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,399
I won't let you get up

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,079
But what about you

94
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,000
Have to listen to him

95
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,679
That's great

96
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,399
The wound opened again

97
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,320
You want to

98
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Don't let the empress worry

99
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,279
Still covering the wound

100
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,679
Let others become

101
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,959
The Great Hero of Rescue

102
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
What the hell is going on

103
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
It's just skin injuries

104
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,920
Which is so delicate

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
Go and fetch my book

106
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,760
Your Highness

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,200
Your Highness

108
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,880
The food bureau came to deliver snacks

109
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,920
At your command

110
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,040
Bring people in

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,760
When did I ever tell you

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,480
Let her in

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,359
Yes

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,440
Handmaiden greets His Royal Highness the Prince

115
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,079
Your Highness hardly moved at lunch

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,399
Meng Shangshi charged the handmaiden

117
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,519
Send some cakes

118
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,959
You're awake

119
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,200
Don't get up

120
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,959
I just came to see you

121
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:30,880
I fear

122
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,840
I said there was no need to be polite

123
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:34,960
You're hurt

124
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,200
Prince Xie

125
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,840
No

126
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,280
I want to thank you

127
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
It is my duty to protect the driver

128
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,479
I dare not bear the word thank you from the prince

129
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,559
You protected the emperor for me

130
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,559
Fulfill one's duty as a son

131
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,039
Should be thanked

132
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,320
But

133
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,840
In the past, ministers only acted on orders

134
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
There are occasional offenses

135
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,200
I also hope your highness Haihan

136
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,479
You can thank me again

137
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,840
I didn't come to see you

138
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm here to kill you

139
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,799
Grandpa Huang said

140
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,159
You know the military

141
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,400
Military machine change

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,599
Suppress bandits and counter-insurgency

143
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,520
Repeatedly make outstanding achievements

144
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,880
I thought your ambition was just martial arts

145
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,559
But now it seems that

146
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,919
This room is full of classics and history

147
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,799
Landscape travel notes

148
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,599
We just know

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
You dabble in a wide range

150
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,200
Have lofty aspirations

151
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,679
The emperor suspected that his ministers had little knowledge

152
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,840
Order me to read more books

153
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,479
But I am a warrior

154
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,520
I can't stand poetry and songs

155
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,400
But find some books to fill the facade

156
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,799
Let the prince laugh

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,679
Is it

158
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,280
Nature

159
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,159
Lord You

160
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,239
His Royal Highness the Prince

161
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:49,640
Just

162
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Let's talk about it some other time

163
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
To His Royal Highness the Prince

164
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,479
Why is Father Liu here

165
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,159
Lord You

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,159
Take the decree

167
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,000
The emperor gave you adult

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Death-free gold medal

169
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,880
You adult handmaiden gives food by decree

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,159
Your Majesty's Oracle

171
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,880
Adult You is seriously injured

172
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,760
You can avoid a big gift

173
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,039
Put it here. You go first

174
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,159
I haven't congratulated you yet

175
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,039
Every cloud has a silver lining

176
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,440
Get a royal gift

177
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
Don't say the gold medal for avoiding death

178
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,039
I heard that Prince Lian

179
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,159
Everyone came to visit me personally

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,359
Get the royal gift from Emperor Taizu

181
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,239
The hero of Danshu Iron Voucher is expensive

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,719
All died of rebellion, and none of them were spared

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
Don't curse me

184
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,880
Today's Son of Heaven

185
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,559
The name of benevolence spreads all over the world

186
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,679
Lord You's blood won't flow in vain

187
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,239
Is it

188
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,039
Say a few jokes

189
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,919
Why should you be angry

190
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,719
According to this food list in the future,

191
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,200
Cooking for Your Majesty

192
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,359
Forget your promise

193
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,679
Rest assured

194
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Not poison

195
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,159
Go ahead

196
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,039
What's the matter

197
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,679
Don't move

198
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,599
Don't do superfluous things

199
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,679
Young and ignorant

200
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,440
I always hope to meet someone

201
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,159
Someone who can dress my wound

202
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,400
Unfortunately, I didn't wait

203
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,599
Today

204
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,239
Just let me mind my own business one more time

205
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,479
Then I'm a little luckier than you

206
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,239
I'm waiting

207
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,679
Childe

208
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,599
Childe wake up

209
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,799
There is one closed there

210
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,840
A woman who has committed a crime

211
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,440
As for what crime she committed,

212
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,119
Why are you locked up there

213
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,559
How long will it be locked up again

214
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,239
No one knows

215
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm curious

216
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,039
How can anyone be behind bars

217
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,799
Still so nosy

218
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
So I disguised myself as a beggar

219
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,400
Want to see what she really is

220
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,359
What kind of person is it

221
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,799
Steamed buns just coming out of the pot

222
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,200
Steaming steamed buns

223
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,440
Gadgets, gadgets, gadgets

224
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,320
Sachet sachet

225
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Sugar-coated haws

226
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,520
When I found out that the world

227
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,039
There are times when such a fool really exists

228
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:37,640
I think

229
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
No matter what crime she committed,

230
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,159
I'll set her free

231
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,000
Did you see her last

232
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,719
No

233
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,359
The meal is getting cold

234
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,719
Let's eat first

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,680
Lord Mei

236
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,359
Please

237
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,040
Lord Mei

238
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,359
Your Highness invites ministers to get together

239
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,439
I thought it was a joke

240
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,400
I didn't expect your highness to be so meticulous

241
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,199
Prepared meals

242
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,439
They are all my favorite foods

243
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
That minister is disrespectful

244
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,119
Your Highness

245
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,520
It is the food bureau that has the heart

246
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,920
Back to your highness's words

247
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,359
Your Highness ordered a banquet for Mei Yushi

248
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,880
Shang Food Bureau naturally does not dare to neglect

249
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Shui Xin has a poem

250
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,640
Don't wait for the forest frost to ripen

251
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,079
When steamed, it will be made into Dongting fragrance

252
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,119
This is Dongting, isn't it

253
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,359
Lord Mei

254
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,319
This is made of chopped lotus

255
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,560
And orange leaves

256
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,520
With rice noodles and honey

257
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,280
Finally, wrap it in orange leaves

258
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,800
Steamed pastry

259
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,640
Sure enough, there is seed

260
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,319
The lingering fragrance of oranges

261
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,520
When I was a teenager, I read a section on pebble soup

262
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:17,439
A moment of curiosity

263
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,079
Have also taken

264
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,479
Cooking stones in clear springs

265
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,640
The so-called spring stone gas in the book

266
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,040
I don't realize it

267
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,800
It took a lot of firewood

268
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,119
Lord Mei is really good at joking

269
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,400
The reader is so arty

270
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Isn't it ridiculous

271
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,000
Lord Mei

272
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,400
Su Yijian was drunk on a snowy night in Song Dynasty

273
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,359
Wake up thirsty in the middle of the night

274
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,839
See a pickle jar buried in the snow

275
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,040
Take it and drink it

276
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,680
I thought it was rare in the world

277
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:46,839
The sour soup

278
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,400
How can you compare dragon liver and phoenix gallbladder

279
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,520
But I answered that sentence

280
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,119
Food has no fixed taste

281
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,599
Palatable people are just precious

282
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,400
The ancients ate jade and drank dew

283
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
It must be the same reason

284
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,599
This room is stuffy and panicked

285
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:04,760
Let's go outside for a walk

286
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:05,800
Yes

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,719
What are you doing

288
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Take it outside

289
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,000
Recipe canon meal

290
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,079
Take it out

291
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,800
Slow down, slow down

292
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,560
What is this dish

293
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,479
This

294
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,479
This is a young pigeon

295
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,439
This yellow fish meat

296
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,000
Can imitate the taste of crab meat

297
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,439
You have to talk to me about it

298
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,040
Your Highness

299
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,400
Have a cup of hot tea

300
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,280
Warm the stomach

301
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,319
Lord Mei

302
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,959
Don't keep your highness waiting for a long time

303
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,040
How

304
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,280
Your Highness is angry

305
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,439
It's all my fault

306
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,359
It's too speculative to chat with Yao Dianshan

307
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,319
That's right

308
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I heard that Yao Dianshan is proficient in medicated diet

309
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,719
I happen to have something to ask for advice

310
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,079
Master Mei speaks heavily

311
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,439
I have something to say.

312
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:07,760
I

313
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,640
Your Highness

314
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,040
Your Highness has been unwell in recent days

315
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,839
How can you sit in the tuyere

316
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,000
Your Highness

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
Let's move in

318
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Yao canon meal

319
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,560
In this world

320
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
There can be a diet for treating heart diseases

321
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,079
I think your highness is very ill

322
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Lord Mei

323
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,920
Your Highness has a heart disease

324
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,199
It occurred to me that there was another urgent matter

325
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,199
Please accuse your highness for me

326
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll go first

327
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,199
Lord Mei

328
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,359
This painting hasn't been finished yet

329
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,079
Come back tomorrow

330
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,119
What are you doing

331
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,599
Move in

332
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,239
Recipe canon meal

333
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,719
Stay step

334
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:23,199
Lord Mei

335
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:23,839
Please stay

336
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,520
You slow down

337
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,239
Don't run away

338
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,000
Grab her

339
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:42,880
What are you doing

340
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,680
Give it to her

341
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,000
Yao Dianshan said you were in the palace

342
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:53,640
I've been

343
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,839
Take this purse with you

344
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,439
This is what the restaurant should pay you

345
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,119
You were young at that time

346
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,439
I'm afraid you will spend it indiscriminately

347
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,520
Drop to theft again

348
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,160
I've been saving it for you

349
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,359
Now it is returned to its original owner

350
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,839
I'm leaving

351
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,920
Your Highness, please eat

352
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,640
You play the piano for me

353
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,280
Your Highness

354
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,359
Handmaiden's Hand

355
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,680
I can't play the piano now

356
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,359
Then I'll play the piano and you'll listen

357
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,160
Handmaiden dare not

358
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,520
Your Highness has not recovered from his injuries

359
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,760
How dare you overwork yourself

360
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,040
Yeah

361
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,239
I forgot

362
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,040
He is also good at the piano

363
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,839
When you want to listen to the piano,

364
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,359
Naturally, someone will caress you

365
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,560
Send her out

366
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:08,959
Yes

367
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,239
Chen

368
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,040
Father-in-law Chen

369
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,680
What did your highness mean just now

370
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,239
Yao canon meal

371
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,359
I don't want to criticize innocent you

372
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,760
Willing to keep one's mouth shut

373
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
So don't ask

374
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,040
How does your highness treat you

375
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,079
It's not that you don't know

376
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
How can you have the heart to break his heart

377
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,599
I break your highness's heart

378
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,239
What did I do

379
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,079
I have been with your highness since I was a child

380
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,160
Your Highness will always be

381
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,359
A high-spirited appearance

382
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,239
Never met him

383
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,359
So disheartened

384
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,400
You

385
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
You have gone too far

386
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,479
I go too far

387
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,040
Just

388
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,959
This shouldn't be what I said

389
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,479
You'd better help yourself

390
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,280
Your Highness commanded

391
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,839
Let me take you home myself

392
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:38,920
Please

393
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,160
Father-in-law Chen

394
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,599
What the hell did I do

395
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,439
Please

396
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:08,880
Sheng Tai Yi

397
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,880
Please, please

398
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,040
Yes

399
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
What does this mean

400
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,520
At the end of the day

401
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,199
Dr. Sheng will heal you

402
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,400
Until your hand is healed

403
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,160
Your Highness's orders have been brought to me

404
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,040
I'll take my leave first

405
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,920
How

406
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,000
Guilt

407
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,000
Why do you feel guilty

408
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,560
This lad is rude

409
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,439
But words collide with me

410
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,800
I would have held my heart to the bright moon

411
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:32,520
Who knows the bright moon shines on the ditch

412
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,920
You

413
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,760
This word is used here

414
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,040
But it's absolutely inappropriate

415
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,439
Look

416
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:44,800
Give it to me

417
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,359
I don't know how to draw

418
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,640
But this painting is so carefully drawn

419
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,199
It can be seen that the other party is deeply affectionate

420
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,000
Who won't be moved by this

421
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,560
I'm not moved

422
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,520
You have a heart of stone

423
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,319
If this were me

424
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll leave some rubies behind

425
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,599
Emerald

426
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,760
Emerald opal

427
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,760
Won't stay

428
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,079
What kind of broken painting is this

429
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,640
Then what is this

430
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,199
Yin Ziping

431
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,319
This purse

432
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,040
But it's for men

433
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,079
To whom does this belong

434
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,800
Son, give it back to me

435
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,000
You tell me

436
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,119
You give it back to me first

437
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,520
Who is this man

438
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,560
You give it back to me first

439
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,239
You tell me to give it back to you

440
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:40,800
You give it back to me first

441
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,760
I'll tell you again

442
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,439
You give it back to me

443
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:44,640
To whom does this belong

444
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
You give it back to me

445
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,520
Zi Jin

446
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,920
You give it back to me

447
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Give it back to you

448
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:52,800
Whose

449
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,040
You give it back to me first

450
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,680
All right, all right, all right

451
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,760
Here you are

452
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,560
Light point

453
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,119
My hand

454
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,479
Inverse
