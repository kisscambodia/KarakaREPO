1
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,839
Your Highness has not recovered from his injuries

2
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,439
How can Your Majesty let you now

3
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,599
Leave for Nanjing

4
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,719
Royal Guards have found out

5
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,280
The middleman who made contact with the assassin

6
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,640
When they arrived,

7
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,959
People have committed suicide

8
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,319
But the identity of that man

9
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,119
Very unusual

10
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,760
Do you remember

11
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,199
When I was eight years old

12
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,560
Grandpa Huang himself

13
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,319
Recruiting government troops from the people, avant-garde young troops

14
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,199
Follow me to practice martial arts and train soldiers

15
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
He used to be a soldier in the young army

16
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,319
This is clearly a structure

17
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:52,920
How can Your Majesty believe

18
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,040
What about this nonsense

19
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,359
This man not only alienates our father and son

20
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,319
And tried to transfer me out of Beijing

21
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,959
His heart can be punished

22
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,479
Please take your highness to dinner

23
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,119
He is a man of integrity

24
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,199
Strong character

25
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,640
However, those who are rigid are easy to fold

26
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,160
Get involved in officialdom too early

27
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,599
Is not necessarily a good thing

28
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,280
I'll find a way

29
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
Let him out

30
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,680
Exercise for a few years

31
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,079
Treat him with full wings

32
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,239
Someday

33
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,959
It must be the pillar of the country

34
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,520
He cares about the world and his home country

35
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,760
Often lenient with others

36
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,599
Be strict with oneself

37
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,839
Especially when it comes to family

38
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,640
The constraints will be too strict

39
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
I'm afraid you won't get used to it

40
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,839
That's right

41
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,599
I forgot

42
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,319
You're so nice

43
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,079
How could he say you

44
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,479
Your Highness

45
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,640
What exactly do you mean

46
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,479
Aren't you leaving the palace

47
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
Your Highness wants to release me from the palace

48
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,760
But the Empress

49
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,680
I have my own way

50
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,959
Have nothing to do with others

51
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,959
Your Highness didn't deceive me

52
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
But why

53
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,479
I haven't seen you for a long time

54
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,640
Laugh so happily

55
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,359
At least he can make you laugh

56
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,640
Waiting for your husband to sing along with your wife in the future

57
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,760
And harmonious

58
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,640
Don't know

59
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,199
Will you still remember this study

60
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,160
Will you remember me

61
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,239
His Highness said he was

62
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,119
Who the hell is it

63
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,719
Let's go

64
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,079
Or I'll go back on my word

65
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,760
Your Highness promised me to leave the palace and marry

66
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,439
But no matter how good that person is,

67
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,760
But not my sweetheart

68
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,640
Who is your sweetheart

69
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,800
It's nobody

70
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,719
Your Highness

71
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,239
This steamed chicken made by Guiqi

72
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
It is made of Angelica sinensis

73
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,760
And chicken stewed with roasted Astragalus membranaceus

74
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,160
People with loss of qi and blood after illness

75
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,000
Use the best

76
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,640
I know you have a bad appetite recently

77
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,719
You can use some

78
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,920
It is of great benefit to your injury

79
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,560
And said you didn't care about me

80
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,640
Your Highness misunderstood

81
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,920
It's a prescription prescribed by Dr. Sheng Tai

82
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,239
We're just

83
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,479
It's just cooking according to the prescription

84
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,319
Your Highness

85
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,199
Dr. Sheng knows

86
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,680
Your injury has been delayed

87
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,160
Diet is the best way to dispense medicine

88
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Therefore, I ordered people to send medicated diet today

89
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,479
Where is this Shengyin

90
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,839
What an old fool

91
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,160
Clearly told you to prepare meals

92
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,160
And asked someone to send it again

93
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,560
Handmaiden retires

94
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,479
Ali

95
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,760
You guys stand down

96
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,239
It's your highness

97
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,919
You don't want to say

98
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,239
I won't force you

99
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,199
Anyway

100
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,560
I don't have a few days to bother you either

101
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,959
I will go to Nanjing soon

102
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,000
Your Highness

103
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
Your injury is not healed

104
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,479
Don't overwork yourself

105
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,199
This is my father's order

106
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,399
This is the prince's fault

107
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,800
It is obviously my father who suspects me

108
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,479
Why is it my fault

109
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,959
Your Highness wants father and son to make up

110
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,760
You should let go of the estrangement

111
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,239
Sincerely to the emperor

112
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,439
Show your heart

113
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,000
You think I haven't tried

114
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,520
But every time

115
00:34:59,239 --> 00:34:59,879
My father put me

116
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,439
Keep it away thousands of miles away

117
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,239
Maybe

118
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,520
Is that your highness used the wrong method

119
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,399
Well done

120
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,399
Recipe canon meal

121
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,199
Can I do it today

122
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,520
Go to the meal with you

123
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,879
When was the food bureau so unruly

124
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
A small palm meal

125
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,600
I also want to enter Ganqing Palace

126
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,159
Don't step down yet

127
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,280
Sosur meal

128
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,639
Meng Shangshi is slightly dyed with wind and cold today

129
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,399
You can't go to Ganqing Palace to deliver food

130
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,840
I just want to help Fang Dianshan

131
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,239
It's time to deliver food

132
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,959
Your Majesty

133
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,320
This snack

134
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,879
Originated from Lin'an City in Southern Song Dynasty

135
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,879
It is made of cheese and sucrose

136
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,439
Oysters are often called abalone

137
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
So this oyster-shaped snack

138
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,239
It is called abalone snail

139
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,639
This porridge is good

140
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,399
Handmaiden is a fire room

141
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,080
Cultivated chamomile seedlings cook porridge

142
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,560
The taste is refreshing and appetizing

143
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,760
Of course I know

144
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,239
This is the taste of hometown

145
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,919
Nanjing calls this chrysanthemum brain

146
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,959
Eat as soup

147
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,199
You recently

148
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,560
This benefit is really not small

149
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,439
Last time it was handmaiden recklessness

150
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,439
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

151
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,040
Father

152
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,760
Your Highness, be careful

153
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,679
It was all an unintentional loss

154
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,919
I won't blame you

155
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,919
Avoid

156
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,199
Your Majesty forgives the handmaiden

157
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,399
Handmaiden Thanksgiving

158
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,760
Handmaiden is listening to the Imperial Doctor

159
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:48,919
Since the banquet in Shangyuan,

160
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
Your Majesty was frightened

161
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,080
Be dizzy all the time

162
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,280
This reminds me of chamomile seedlings

163
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,600
Can treat vertigo and headache

164
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,199
This is the courage to try

165
00:37:58,879 --> 00:37:59,840
Scared, huh

166
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,080
The handmaiden is really frightened

167
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,159
Hiding in the corner all the time

168
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,080
Trembling

169
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,199
Later I saw

170
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,560
The Imperial Concubine Empress is also next to her

171
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,840
This is a relief

172
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,679
Save the driver quickly

173
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,439
Rescue driver

174
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:15,360
Protect the Emperor

175
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:22,080
Your Majesty

176
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:25,840
Your Majesty

177
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Guo Guifei asked for an audience

178
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,360
Be absent

179
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,639
Yes

180
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm going to the school yard this afternoon

181
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,719
Send dinner there

182
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:49,600
Yes

183
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,719
Father

184
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:31,120
Aren't you leaving for Nanjing

185
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,320
Why haven't you started yet

186
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
My son prepared a meal

187
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,041
Let's have dinner together

188
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,680
No need
