1
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,881
Your Highness

2
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,121
An assassin

3
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,400
They are all carefully trained dead men

4
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,801
Only two people were left alive

5
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,920
One person died of serious injuries after being imprisoned

6
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:34,121
There is only one person left

7
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:35,600
Royal Guards

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,121
Is following his line down

9
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,680
As for the last yuan day,

10
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,000
Records of entering and leaving the palace

11
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,881
Hundred troupe song and dance artists

12
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,040
Craftsmen from the Ministry of Industry and the Supervisory Bureaus of Neifu

13
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,680
A total of 643 people

14
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,280
All personnel are registered

15
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,441
It will take some time to check

16
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,760
What do you think

17
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,041
Your Highness

18
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,521
Who is the real murderer is obvious

19
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,081
If Your Majesty and the Prince

20
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:00,161
The handmaiden dared to say

21
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:01,120
Can't get away from left and right

22
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,241
The handwriting of two princes

23
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,521
Come on, come on

24
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:07,801
Don't keep taking these things

25
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:08,840
To disturb your highness for illness

26
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,640
Can you do it?

27
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,801
Your Highness, lunch has arrived

28
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:23,000
Where is she

29
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:24,401
It's still out there

30
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,640
Your Highness Hat

31
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,360
Lord Mei

32
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,241
What happened last time

33
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,760
I am deeply disturbed

34
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,881
Always looking for opportunities

35
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,000
I apologize to you

36
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
Meals for me

37
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,161
Did you make it yourself

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,280
That's why

39
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,801
There is something wrong with the meal

40
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,321
I am to blame

41
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,401
I hope you will forgive me

42
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,241
That's enough

43
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,120
His Highness has suffered from insomnia recently

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,081
More ginseng should not be put in the soup

45
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Excessive tonic is also prone to insomnia

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,681
Yao canon meal

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,801
How do you know

48
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,161
Your Highness didn't sleep well

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,000
Lunch delivered in the past

50
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,521
Your Highness hasn't used it up

51
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,840
Only lily jujube soup is used up

52
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,720
It can be seen that it is for peace of mind

53
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:51,881
Your Highness

54
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,040
Your Highness

55
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,561
You don't have to worry about things in court

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,160
Let's relax and recuperate

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,121
Your Highness

58
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,121
How dare a handmaiden reveal it

59
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:13,880
These things

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,721
Lord Mei

61
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,681
You testify for the handmaiden

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,920
I just stepped into that threshold

63
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,480
I smell a breath of blood

64
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
His Royal Highness is pale

65
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,841
The voice is weaker than before

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,561
Or don't hold on

67
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,121
Yeah

68
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,001
It seems that today

69
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,760
I can't visit my mother

70
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,841
So as not to be seen through

71
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:36,561
In a good mood today

72
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:37,721
Have a round

73
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:50,801
Your Highness

74
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,081
Can I have dirt on my face

75
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,241
You frequently look at me

76
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:58,401
I naturally have to misunderstand

77
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:00,081
Or I am today

78
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,241
Extremely heroic and natural and unrestrained

79
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:01,920
Extraordinary charm

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,320
His Highness finally smiled

81
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:06,561
On weekdays, I enter the door

82
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:07,920
Your Highness always smiles at each other

83
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:10,320
Today, since stepping over that threshold,

84
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,480
Your Highness has never shown his face

85
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,040
I almost thought

86
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,760
Where did you offend your highness

87
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:23,600
Shaoyuan

88
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,200
Are you married

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,880
Lord Mei

90
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:48,681
Let's go

91
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,801
The Imperial Doctor has already said it

92
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,480
I won't let you get up

93
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:18,160
But what about you

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,081
Have to listen to him

95
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:20,760
That's great

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
The wound opened again

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,401
You want to

98
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,401
Don't let the empress worry

99
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,360
Still covering the wound

100
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,760
Let others become

101
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,040
The Great Hero of Rescue

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
What the hell is going on

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
It's just skin injuries

104
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,001
Which is so delicate

105
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,521
Go and fetch my book

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,841
Your Highness

107
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:37,281
Your Highness

108
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,961
The food bureau came to deliver snacks

109
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,001
At your command

110
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,121
Bring people in

111
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:43,841
When did I ever tell you

112
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:46,561
Let her in

113
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:47,440
Yes

114
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,521
Handmaiden greets His Royal Highness the Prince

115
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,160
Your Highness hardly moved at lunch

116
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:06,480
Meng Shangshi charged the handmaiden

117
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,600
Send some cakes

118
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,040
You're awake

119
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:09,281
Don't get up

120
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:11,040
I just came to see you

121
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,961
I fear

122
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:15,921
I said there was no need to be polite

123
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,041
You're hurt

124
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,281
Prince Xie

125
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:22,921
No

126
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:24,361
I want to thank you

127
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:26,760
It is my duty to protect the driver

128
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
I dare not bear the word thank you from the prince

129
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:30,640
You protected the emperor for me

130
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,640
Fulfill one's duty as a son

131
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,120
Should be thanked

132
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,401
But

133
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,921
In the past, ministers only acted on orders

134
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,081
There are occasional offenses

135
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,281
I also hope your highness Haihan

136
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,560
You can thank me again

137
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,921
I didn't come to see you

138
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:44,361
I'm here to kill you

139
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:53,880
Grandpa Huang said

140
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,240
You know the military

141
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,481
Military machine change

142
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:57,680
Suppress bandits and counter-insurgency

143
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,601
Repeatedly make outstanding achievements

144
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,961
I thought your ambition was just martial arts

145
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,640
But now it seems that

146
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,000
This room is full of classics and history

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,880
Landscape travel notes

148
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,680
We just know

149
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,161
You dabble in a wide range

150
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,281
Have lofty aspirations

151
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,760
The emperor suspected that his ministers had little knowledge

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,921
Order me to read more books

153
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,560
But I am a warrior

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,601
I can't stand poetry and songs

155
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,481
But find some books to fill the facade

156
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
Let the prince laugh

157
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:22,760
Is it

158
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,361
Nature

159
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:26,240
Lord You

160
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,320
His Royal Highness the Prince

161
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,721
Just

162
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,041
Let's talk about it some other time

163
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,481
To His Royal Highness the Prince

164
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,560
Why is Father Liu here

165
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:42,240
Lord You

166
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,240
Take the decree

167
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,081
The emperor gave you adult

168
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,281
Death-free gold medal

169
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,961
You adult handmaiden gives food by decree

170
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,240
Your Majesty's Oracle

171
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,961
Adult You is seriously injured

172
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:16,841
You can avoid a big gift

173
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,120
Put it here. You go first

174
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,240
I haven't congratulated you yet

175
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,120
Every cloud has a silver lining

176
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:41,521
Get a royal gift

177
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,721
Don't say the gold medal for avoiding death

178
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,120
I heard that Prince Lian

179
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,240
Everyone came to visit me personally

180
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:49,440
Get the royal gift from Emperor Taizu

181
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,320
The hero of Danshu Iron Voucher is expensive

182
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,800
All died of rebellion, and none of them were spared

183
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:55,281
Don't curse me

184
00:11:59,281 --> 00:11:59,961
Today's Son of Heaven

185
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,640
The name of benevolence spreads all over the world

186
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:03,760
Lord You's blood won't flow in vain

187
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,320
Is it

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Say a few jokes

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,000
Why should you be angry

190
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,800
According to this food list in the future,

191
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,281
Cooking for Your Majesty

192
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
Forget your promise

193
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,760
Rest assured

194
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:49,041
Not poison

195
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,240
Go ahead

196
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:10,120
What's the matter

197
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,760
Don't move

198
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,680
Don't do superfluous things

199
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Young and ignorant

200
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,521
I always hope to meet someone

201
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:20,240
Someone who can dress my wound

202
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,481
Unfortunately, I didn't wait

203
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:27,680
Today

204
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,320
Just let me mind my own business one more time

205
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,560
Then I'm a little luckier than you

206
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,320
I'm waiting

207
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:27,760
Childe

208
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:31,680
Childe wake up

209
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:35,880
There is one closed there

210
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,921
A woman who has committed a crime

211
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,521
As for what crime she committed,

212
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:41,200
Why are you locked up there

213
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,640
How long will it be locked up again

214
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,320
No one knows

215
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,921
I'm curious

216
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,120
How can anyone be behind bars

217
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,880
Still so nosy

218
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,361
So I disguised myself as a beggar

219
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,481
Want to see what she really is

220
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,440
What kind of person is it

221
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,880
Steamed buns just coming out of the pot

222
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,281
Steaming steamed buns

223
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,521
Gadgets, gadgets, gadgets

224
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:08,401
Sachet sachet

225
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,361
Sugar-coated haws

226
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,601
When I found out that the world

227
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,120
There are times when such a fool really exists

228
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,721
I think

229
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,081
No matter what crime she committed,

230
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
I'll set her free

231
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:18,081
Did you see her last

232
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,800
No

233
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,440
The meal is getting cold

234
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:50,800
Let's eat first

235
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:06,761
Lord Mei

236
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:08,440
Please

237
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,121
Lord Mei

238
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,440
Your Highness invites ministers to get together

239
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,520
I thought it was a joke

240
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,481
I didn't expect your highness to be so meticulous

241
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,280
Prepared meals

242
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,520
They are all my favorite foods

243
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,761
That minister is disrespectful

244
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,200
Your Highness

245
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,601
It is the food bureau that has the heart

246
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,001
Back to your highness's words

247
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,440
Your Highness ordered a banquet for Mei Yushi

248
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,961
Shang Food Bureau naturally does not dare to neglect

249
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:17,081
Mr. Shui Xin has a poem

250
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,721
Don't wait for the forest frost to ripen

251
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,160
When steamed, it will be made into Dongting fragrance

252
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,200
This is Dongting, isn't it

253
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,440
Lord Mei

254
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,400
This is made of chopped lotus

255
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,641
And orange leaves

256
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,601
With rice noodles and honey

257
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:40,361
Finally, wrap it in orange leaves

258
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:41,881
Steamed pastry

259
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:54,721
Sure enough, there is seed

260
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,400
The lingering fragrance of oranges

261
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,601
When I was a teenager, I read a section on pebble soup

262
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,520
A moment of curiosity

263
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,160
Have also taken

264
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,560
Cooking stones in clear springs

265
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,721
The so-called spring stone gas in the book

266
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,121
I don't realize it

267
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,881
It took a lot of firewood

268
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,200
Lord Mei is really good at joking

269
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,481
The reader is so arty

270
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:12,761
Isn't it ridiculous

271
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,081
Lord Mei

272
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,481
Su Yijian was drunk on a snowy night in Song Dynasty

273
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,440
Wake up thirsty in the middle of the night

274
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,920
See a pickle jar buried in the snow

275
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,121
Take it and drink it

276
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,761
I thought it was rare in the world

277
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,920
The sour soup

278
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,481
How can you compare dragon liver and phoenix gallbladder

279
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,601
But I answered that sentence

280
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,200
Food has no fixed taste

281
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,680
Palatable people are just precious

282
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,481
The ancients ate jade and drank dew

283
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:39,881
It must be the same reason

284
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
This room is stuffy and panicked

285
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,841
Let's go outside for a walk

286
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,881
Yes

287
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,800
What are you doing

288
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:50,961
Take it outside

289
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,081
Recipe canon meal

290
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:58,160
Take it out

291
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,881
Slow down, slow down

292
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,641
What is this dish

293
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,560
This

294
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,560
This is a young pigeon

295
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,520
This yellow fish meat

296
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,081
Can imitate the taste of crab meat

297
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,520
You have to talk to me about it

298
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,121
Your Highness

299
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:16,481
Have a cup of hot tea

300
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,361
Warm the stomach

301
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:22,400
Lord Mei

302
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,040
Don't keep your highness waiting for a long time

303
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,121
How

304
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,361
Your Highness is angry

305
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:27,520
It's all my fault

306
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,440
It's too speculative to chat with Yao Dianshan

307
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:40,400
That's right

308
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,081
I heard that Yao Dianshan is proficient in medicated diet

309
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,800
I happen to have something to ask for advice

310
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
Master Mei speaks heavily

311
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,520
I have something to say.

312
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,841
I

313
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:52,721
Your Highness

314
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,121
Your Highness has been unwell in recent days

315
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:57,920
How can you sit in the tuyere

316
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,081
Your Highness

317
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,121
Let's move in

318
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:14,481
Yao canon meal

319
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:15,641
In this world

320
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:17,001
There can be a diet for treating heart diseases

321
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
I think your highness is very ill

322
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:20,641
Lord Mei

323
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,001
Your Highness has a heart disease

324
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,280
It occurred to me that there was another urgent matter

325
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:28,280
Please accuse your highness for me

326
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,081
I'll go first

327
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,280
Lord Mei

328
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,440
This painting hasn't been finished yet

329
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,160
Come back tomorrow

330
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,200
What are you doing

331
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:36,680
Move in

332
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,320
Recipe canon meal

333
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:04,800
Stay step

334
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,280
Lord Mei

335
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,920
Please stay

336
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,601
You slow down

337
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:07,320
Don't run away

338
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,081
Grab her

339
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,961
What are you doing

340
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,761
Give it to her

341
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,081
Yao Dianshan said you were in the palace

342
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:35,721
I've been

343
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:36,920
Take this purse with you

344
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
This is what the restaurant should pay you

345
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,200
You were young at that time

346
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm afraid you will spend it indiscriminately

347
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,601
Drop to theft again

348
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,241
I've been saving it for you

349
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:47,440
Now it is returned to its original owner

350
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:48,920
I'm leaving

351
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,001
Your Highness, please eat

352
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:22,721
You play the piano for me

353
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,361
Your Highness

354
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:28,440
Handmaiden's Hand

355
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,761
I can't play the piano now

356
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:32,440
Then I'll play the piano and you'll listen

357
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:34,241
Handmaiden dare not

358
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:36,601
Your Highness has not recovered from his injuries

359
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,841
How dare you overwork yourself

360
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,121
Yeah

361
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,320
I forgot

362
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,121
He is also good at the piano

363
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,920
When you want to listen to the piano,

364
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,440
Naturally, someone will caress you

365
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,641
Send her out

366
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,040
Yes

367
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,320
Chen

368
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,121
Father-in-law Chen

369
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,761
What did your highness mean just now

370
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,320
Yao canon meal

371
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,440
I don't want to criticize innocent you

372
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,841
Willing to keep one's mouth shut

373
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:35,361
So don't ask

374
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,121
How does your highness treat you

375
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:43,160
It's not that you don't know

376
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:45,081
How can you have the heart to break his heart

377
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,680
I break your highness's heart

378
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,320
What did I do

379
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,160
I have been with your highness since I was a child

380
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,241
Your Highness will always be

381
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:53,440
A high-spirited appearance

382
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:54,320
Never met him

383
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,440
So disheartened

384
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:56,481
You

385
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:01,081
You have gone too far

386
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,560
I go too far

387
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,121
Just

388
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:06,040
This shouldn't be what I said

389
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,560
You'd better help yourself

390
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,361
Your Highness commanded

391
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:18,920
Let me take you home myself

392
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,001
Please

393
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,241
Father-in-law Chen

394
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:23,680
What the hell did I do

395
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:24,520
Please

396
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,961
Sheng Tai Yi

397
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:51,961
Please, please

398
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,121
Yes

399
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,001
What does this mean

400
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,601
At the end of the day

401
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,280
Dr. Sheng will heal you

402
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,481
Until your hand is healed

403
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,241
Your Highness's orders have been brought to me

404
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,121
I'll take my leave first

405
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:50,001
How

406
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,081
Guilt

407
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:54,081
Why do you feel guilty

408
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,641
This lad is rude

409
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:01,520
But words collide with me

410
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,881
I would have held my heart to the bright moon

411
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:14,601
Who knows the bright moon shines on the ditch

412
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,001
You

413
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,841
This word is used here

414
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,121
But it's absolutely inappropriate

415
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,520
Look

416
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,881
Give it to me

417
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
I don't know how to draw

418
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:31,721
But this painting is so carefully drawn

419
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,280
It can be seen that the other party is deeply affectionate

420
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,081
Who won't be moved by this

421
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,641
I'm not moved

422
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,601
You have a heart of stone

423
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,400
If this were me

424
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,481
I'll leave some rubies behind

425
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,680
Emerald

426
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,841
Emerald opal

427
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:55,841
Won't stay

428
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:57,160
What kind of broken painting is this

429
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:02,721
Then what is this

430
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Yin Ziping

431
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,400
This purse

432
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,121
But it's for men

433
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,160
To whom does this belong

434
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,881
Son, give it back to me

435
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,081
You tell me

436
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,200
You give it back to me first

437
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,601
Who is this man

438
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:20,641
You give it back to me first

439
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,320
You tell me to give it back to you

440
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,881
You give it back to me first

441
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,841
I'll tell you again

442
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,520
You give it back to me

443
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,721
To whom does this belong

444
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:27,881
You give it back to me

445
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:29,601
Zi Jin

446
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,001
You give it back to me

447
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,001
Give it back to you

448
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,881
Whose

449
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,121
You give it back to me first

450
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,761
All right, all right, all right

451
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:38,841
Here you are

452
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:41,641
Light point

453
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:42,200
My hand

454
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,560
Inverse

455
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,879
Your Highness has not recovered from his injuries

456
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,479
How can Your Majesty let you now

457
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,639
Leave for Nanjing

458
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,759
Royal Guards have found out

459
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,320
The middleman who made contact with the assassin

460
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:29,680
When they arrived,

461
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,999
People have committed suicide

462
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,359
But the identity of that man

463
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,159
Very unusual

464
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,800
Do you remember

465
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,239
When I was eight years old

466
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,600
Grandpa Huang himself

467
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,359
Recruiting government troops from the people, avant-garde young troops

468
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,239
Follow me to practice martial arts and train soldiers

469
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,560
He used to be a soldier in the young army

470
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,359
This is clearly a structure

471
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:46,960
How can Your Majesty believe

472
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,080
What about this nonsense

473
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,399
This man not only alienates our father and son

474
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,359
And tried to transfer me out of Beijing

475
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:54,999
His heart can be punished

476
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,519
Please take your highness to dinner

477
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,159
He is a man of integrity

478
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,239
Strong character

479
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,680
However, those who are rigid are easy to fold

480
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,200
Get involved in officialdom too early

481
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:55,639
Is not necessarily a good thing

482
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,320
I'll find a way

483
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,920
Let him out

484
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:00,720
Exercise for a few years

485
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,119
Treat him with full wings

486
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,279
Someday

487
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,999
It must be the pillar of the country

488
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,560
He cares about the world and his home country

489
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,800
Often lenient with others

490
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,639
Be strict with oneself

491
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,879
Especially when it comes to family

492
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,680
The constraints will be too strict

493
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
I'm afraid you won't get used to it

494
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:21,879
That's right

495
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,639
I forgot

496
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,359
You're so nice

497
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,119
How could he say you

498
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,519
Your Highness

499
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,680
What exactly do you mean

500
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,519
Aren't you leaving the palace

501
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,840
Your Highness wants to release me from the palace

502
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:40,800
But the Empress

503
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,720
I have my own way

504
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,999
Have nothing to do with others

505
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,999
Your Highness didn't deceive me

506
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
But why

507
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:50,519
I haven't seen you for a long time

508
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,680
Laugh so happily

509
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,399
At least he can make you laugh

510
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,680
Waiting for your husband to sing along with your wife in the future

511
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,800
And harmonious

512
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,680
Don't know

513
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,239
Will you still remember this study

514
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,200
Will you remember me

515
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,279
His Highness said he was

516
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,159
Who the hell is it

517
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,759
Let's go

518
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,119
Or I'll go back on my word

519
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,800
Your Highness promised me to leave the palace and marry

520
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,479
But no matter how good that person is,

521
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,800
But not my sweetheart

522
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,680
Who is your sweetheart

523
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,840
It's nobody

524
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:43,759
Your Highness

525
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,279
This steamed chicken made by Guiqi

526
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,680
It is made of Angelica sinensis

527
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:50,800
And chicken stewed with roasted Astragalus membranaceus

528
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,200
People with loss of qi and blood after illness

529
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,040
Use the best

530
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,680
I know you have a bad appetite recently

531
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,759
You can use some

532
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,960
It is of great benefit to your injury

533
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,600
And said you didn't care about me

534
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,680
Your Highness misunderstood

535
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,960
It's a prescription prescribed by Dr. Sheng Tai

536
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,279
We're just

537
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,519
It's just cooking according to the prescription

538
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,359
Your Highness

539
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,239
Dr. Sheng knows

540
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,720
Your injury has been delayed

541
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,200
Diet is the best way to dispense medicine

542
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Therefore, I ordered people to send medicated diet today

543
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,519
Where is this Shengyin

544
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,879
What an old fool

545
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,200
Clearly told you to prepare meals

546
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,200
And asked someone to send it again

547
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,600
Handmaiden retires

548
00:34:58,999 --> 00:34:59,519
Ali

549
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:02,800
You guys stand down

550
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,279
It's your highness

551
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,959
You don't want to say

552
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,279
I won't force you

553
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,239
Anyway

554
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,600
I don't have a few days to bother you either

555
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,999
I will go to Nanjing soon

556
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:26,040
Your Highness

557
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,120
Your injury is not healed

558
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,519
Don't overwork yourself

559
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,239
This is my father's order

560
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,439
This is the prince's fault

561
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:39,840
It is obviously my father who suspects me

562
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,519
Why is it my fault

563
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,999
Your Highness wants father and son to make up

564
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,800
You should let go of the estrangement

565
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,279
Sincerely to the emperor

566
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,479
Show your heart

567
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,040
You think I haven't tried

568
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,560
But every time

569
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:53,919
My father put me

570
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,479
Keep it away thousands of miles away

571
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,279
Maybe

572
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,560
Is that your highness used the wrong method

573
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,439
Well done

574
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:17,439
Recipe canon meal

575
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,239
Can I do it today

576
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,560
Go to the meal with you

577
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,919
When was the food bureau so unruly

578
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,400
A small palm meal

579
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,640
I also want to enter Ganqing Palace

580
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,199
Don't step down yet

581
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,320
Sosur meal

582
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,679
Meng Shangshi is slightly dyed with wind and cold today

583
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,439
You can't go to Ganqing Palace to deliver food

584
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,880
I just want to help Fang Dianshan

585
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,279
It's time to deliver food

586
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,999
Your Majesty

587
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,360
This snack

588
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,919
Originated from Lin'an City in Southern Song Dynasty

589
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:35,919
It is made of cheese and sucrose

590
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,479
Oysters are often called abalone

591
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,600
So this oyster-shaped snack

592
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,279
It is called abalone snail

593
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:50,679
This porridge is good

594
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,439
Handmaiden is a fire room

595
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,120
Cultivated chamomile seedlings cook porridge

596
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,600
The taste is refreshing and appetizing

597
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,800
Of course I know

598
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,279
This is the taste of hometown

599
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,959
Nanjing calls this chrysanthemum brain

600
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,999
Eat as soup

601
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:12,239
You recently

602
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,600
This benefit is really not small

603
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,479
Last time it was handmaiden recklessness

604
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,479
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

605
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,080
Father

606
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,800
Your Highness, be careful

607
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,719
It was all an unintentional loss

608
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,959
I won't blame you

609
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,959
Avoid

610
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,239
Your Majesty forgives the handmaiden

611
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,439
Handmaiden Thanksgiving

612
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,800
Handmaiden is listening to the Imperial Doctor

613
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:42,959
Since the banquet in Shangyuan,

614
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,320
Your Majesty was frightened

615
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,120
Be dizzy all the time

616
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,320
This reminds me of chamomile seedlings

617
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,640
Can treat vertigo and headache

618
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,239
This is the courage to try

619
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:53,880
Scared, huh

620
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,120
The handmaiden is really frightened

621
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,199
Hiding in the corner all the time

622
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,120
Trembling

623
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,239
Later I saw

624
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,600
The Imperial Concubine Empress is also next to her

625
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,880
This is a relief

626
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,719
Save the driver quickly

627
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,479
Rescue driver

628
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,400
Protect the Emperor

629
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,120
Your Majesty

630
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:19,880
Your Majesty

631
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Guo Guifei asked for an audience

632
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,400
Be absent

633
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,679
Yes

634
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,160
I'm going to the school yard this afternoon

635
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,759
Send dinner there

636
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:43,640
Yes

637
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,759
Father

638
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:25,160
Aren't you leaving for Nanjing

639
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:26,360
Why haven't you started yet

640
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
My son prepared a meal

641
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,081
Let's have dinner together

642
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,720
No need
