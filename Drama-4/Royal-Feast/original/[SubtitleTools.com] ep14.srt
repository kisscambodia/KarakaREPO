1
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,440
August of the 22nd year of Yongle

2
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,599
Zhu Gaochi, Prince of Daming, ascended the throne as Emperor

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,199
Make Crown Princess Zhang Queen

4
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,360
And canonized Guo as the imperial concubine

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,639
Zhu Zhanji, the great grandson of the emperor, is the crown prince

6
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,160
Hu is the crown princess

7
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,800
Zi Jin

8
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,919
The Crown Princess's Palace sent people

9
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,279
Previous days of crying sacrifice

10
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
Crown princess is weak due to qi deficiency

11
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,479
Have a cough

12
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
Hu Shang's index finger name asked you to make a medicated diet and send it

13
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,679
Yes

14
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,199
The civil and military ministers advised him to enter five times

15
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,720
Your Majesty has just promised to ascend to the throne

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,839
According to etiquette

17
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,279
It has been more than 27 days in mourning

18
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,600
Officials who are in a hurry to change clothes

19
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,759
But I miscalculated

20
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,320
After all, father and son are United

21
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,080
So is the prince

22
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,160
I heard you coughed badly yesterday

23
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
Don't hold on

24
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,839
Or please ask the medicine manager to come and have a look

25
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,320
I was too tired a few days ago

26
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,679
Blood stasis and heat are in it

27
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,559
I caught a cold again last night

28
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,399
Just rest for a few days

29
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,760
Don't make a fuss

30
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,079
Or is your health important

31
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,279
Handmaiden, I'll make you a cup.

32
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,880
Ganfengling developed by Tai Hospital

33
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,200
You drink first

34
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,000
Good

35
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Then it's good to feel the wind these days

36
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,000
Or are you the most considerate

37
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,519
It's very hot

38
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,559
I'm feeling chest tightness and polydipsia

39
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,160
The Crown Princess has been coughing for a long time

40
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,239
Lotus leaf porridge clears heat and moistens lung

41
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,720
Please have a try

42
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,239
Inside are sweet-scented osmanthus and taro puree

43
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes

44
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,880
Cinnamon is fragrant and refreshing

45
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,399
Taro benefits stomach and spleen

46
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,000
But the Crown Princess is weak and has spleen deficiency

47
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,600
Taro is prone to abdominal distension

48
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,399
Not multi-purpose

49
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,359
This lotus leaf porridge is very good for me

50
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,160
Today's meal is light and delicious

51
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,399
Give it to the Crown Prince as it is

52
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,040
Yes

53
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:11,959
Crown Princess

54
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,640
Be careful to lead the wolf into the house

55
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,320
Exemption from Yongle's 22-year hukou salt grain

56
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,000
Horse grass, firewood and charcoal are in arrears everywhere

57
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,399
Since December of Yongle 20 years ago,

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,679
Do your best to avoid

59
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,640
Add another one

60
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,640
Escape to people everywhere

61
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,359
Be forgiven for one's sins

62
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,480
Send back to the place of origin to resume business

63
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,839
Avoid the difference for two years

64
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,399
Taxes and grain owed by their households

65
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
Do your best to avoid

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,519
Father

67
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,239
I'm just going to buy everywhere

68
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Is that why you're here

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,880
Father stopped in Xishima and Yunnan

70
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,359
Acquisition of cross toes

71
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,600
It's all a matter of caring for the people

72
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,000
My son has no objection

73
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,559
Only the return of Nanjing

74
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,440
I also ask my father to think twice

75
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,160
Who said it was all returned

76
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,279
Who said it was all returned

77
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,160
You know before I say it

78
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,399
Are you sending someone now

79
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,359
Peep at my every move

80
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,559
Father calms his anger

81
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,320
I just heard that my father ordered people to go south

82
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,000
When repairing Nanjing Imperial City, I dared to speculate

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
After the great funeral of Grandpa Huang,

84
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,839
Father may intend to return it all

85
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,119
If my son guessed wrong

86
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,559
I also ask my father to forgive me

87
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,959
Since moving the capital

88
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,720
South-to-North Grain Transfer

89
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,760
Wasting people and money

90
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,799
Arutai is constantly disturbing and causing trouble

91
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,440
Nanjing

92
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,200
It is the capital set by Taizu

93
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,720
Return to Nanjing

94
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,239
That is to follow the old system of our ancestors

95
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,040
Father

96
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,079
Beijing is the land of Longxing

97
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:18,600
Natural barrier and geographical advantage

98
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,679
Grandpa Huang moved the capital here

99
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,040
It is to respect the son of heaven

100
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,640
Guard the gate of Daming

101
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,880
System 4 razes the world and achieves the foundation of the world

102
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,200
It's easy to return it in a hurry

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Grandpa Huang's painstaking efforts will be destroyed

104
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,880
Father

105
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,039
The man that Grandpa Huang wants to kill

106
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,919
Regardless of the severity of the crime

107
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,440
You will be forgiven

108
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,200
The national policy he set

109
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
It is also a change of course one by one

110
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,280
Run in the opposite direction everywhere

111
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,760
Why on earth

112
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Prince

113
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,039
Don't rely on the favor of the first emperor

114
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,919
You can be so presumptuous to me

115
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,359
Grandfather loves me

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,719
Just because the people in the world who can understand him

117
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,640
Just me

118
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,119
Grandfather's ambition father doesn't understand

119
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,039
I'll never understand

120
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
You just want to be a king of benevolence and righteousness

121
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,960
But now the country's biggest future trouble is not removed

122
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,679
Rely solely on benevolence and righteousness

123
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,239
Unable to govern the world

124
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,159
Then you tell me

125
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,440
What is the future trouble

126
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,599
A captaincy

127
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,000
What I do

128
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,840
You don't have to worry about it

129
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,559
Get the hell out of here

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Get out of here

131
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,840
My son retires

132
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,440
Continue

133
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes

134
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,239
At that time, the Royal Guards were ordered by the Imperial Examination

135
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Supervise the East Palace

136
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,520
Where is the volume

137
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,440
When Grandpa Huang wins, he will return to the DPRK

138
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,280
We went hunting together

139
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,039
Your Excellency

140
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,159
We have been ordered to monitor the East Palace

141
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Now the new emperor has succeeded to the throne

142
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,200
Will you settle accounts after autumn

143
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,320
Kneel down

144
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,799
Hu Shang Shi

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,880
What does this mean

146
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,159
Crown Princess

147
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,640
Handmaiden specially came to plead guilty today

148
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
Handmaiden is lax in royal control

149
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,919
Let Yao Ziliao commit the great crime of privately longitudinal Zhuang Fei

150
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,280
Private longitudinal Zhuang Fei

151
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
Before Zhuang Fei was buried

152
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,440
Yao Ziliao took advantage of the meal delivery machine

153
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,760
Privately vertical Zhuang Fei out of the palace

154
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,559
This matter is proved by Ajin, a maid of Yongning Palace

155
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,200
Now the harem is initially decided

156
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,919
Empress Empress is busy with everything

157
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
Handmaiden dare not disturb

158
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,039
Specially came to ask the Crown Princess to decide

159
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,320
Hu Shang Shi

160
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,359
Do you know what a sin it is to falsely accuse

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
Even if you were my elder sister

162
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,159
I won't be light either

163
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,159
Ah Kin

164
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,880
How dare you hide it in front of the Crown Princess

165
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,280
Is it desperate

166
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,840
Crown Princess

167
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,679
It was Miss Yao who gave her master a jade pendant

168
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,359
Just walked out of Bei'an Gate safely

169
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,159
What jade pendant

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,119
A phoenix that only a queen can have

171
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,320
The Bei'anmen guard is an old man in the palace

172
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,679
Once you see this pendant,

173
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,640
Panic is still less than enough

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,919
How dare you stop it

175
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,200
General Chen Lao promised to keep his mouth shut

176
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,760
On returning to the palace

177
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,919
But you need to leave Pei as evidence

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,039
Yao Ziliao

179
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,679
Where did you get it

180
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,640
It is said that this Feng Pei was carved by the first emperor himself

181
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,200
Empress Renxiao carries it with her day and night

182
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,359
Seeing Pei in the palace is like seeing the Lord

183
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,679
You can't obey orders

184
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,840
Empress Renxiao personally raised the prince

185
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,200
Grandparents and grandchildren have deep feelings

186
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,559
After she died

187
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,159
Leave Yu Pei to the First Emperor

188
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,440
Indicate that you should leave it to your future grandson-in-law

189
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
You said

190
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,039
This jade pendant

191
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,679
Why is it in the hands of a female official

192
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,280
Yao Ziliao

193
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,679
Who the hell are you

194
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,679
Your Highness

195
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:18,840
Tell her to come

196
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,919
Your Highness

197
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,719
I want to see her

198
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,400
Yes

199
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,239
What is it

200
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,000
Your Highness

201
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,719
General Chen Lao, the guard of Bei'an Gate

202
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,400
Know that your highness is waiting for the catalpa palace day and night

203
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,479
Never dared to disturb

204
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,599
Heard about your highness's return

205
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,799
There is one thing to offer

206
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Why don't you answer

207
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,599
Yao Ziliao

208
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,599
She was the first emperor of that year

209
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,320
The princess set for the prince

210
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,159
Mrs. Peng Chengbo

211
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,200
Crown Princess

212
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,840
Sun Shi is ten years old

213
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
She was introduced to the palace by Mrs. Peng Chengbo

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,479
Raised by Queen Zhang today

215
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,119
Six months later

216
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,599
Sun Shi came out of the palace with illness

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,280
Stay in Yongcheng for illness

218
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,919
You can only get married when you grow up

219
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,840
Who knows that the first emperor complied with the destiny

220
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,880
Change you to be your princess

221
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,679
Sun Shi is narrow-minded

222
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,599
A serious illness

223
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,239
After the first emperor learned about it,

224
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,239
Be greatly unhappy

225
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,520
No one has dared to mention her since then

226
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,840
Crown Princess

227
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,359
I told you that you are kind and righteous

228
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,880
See it now

229
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,799
You have been blinded by this snake and scorpion woman

230
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,599
She concealed her identity and entered the palace

231
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,960
Lurking by your side

232
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,760
What exactly is the purpose

233
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,880
It speaks for itself

234
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,559
Hu Shang Shi

235
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,799
You and I get along for a long time

236
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,280
Have I ever done a bad thing

237
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,039
Killed a man

238
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,440
Don't you dare say

239
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,640
You concealed your identity and entered the palace

240
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,559
It's not for another purpose

241
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,760
Crown Princess

242
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,000
This woman stays in trouble

243
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,200
Can't be tolerated

244
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,280
I know you can't be ruthless

245
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,119
I'll do it for you

246
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,320
Bearer

247
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,559
Are you really going to kill me

248
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:56,880
Hu Shang Shi

249
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,080
Hu Shang Shi

250
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,880
Palm meal Yao Ziliao

251
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
With intent to murder the Crown Princess

252
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,040
Not allowed to be interrogated by Gong Zhengsi

253
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,880
Has committed suicide by taking poison

254
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,199
Crown Princess

255
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,680
The evidence is here

256
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,880
Crown Princess

257
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,800
Previous

258
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,079
You want to take my identity

259
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
Now we have to fabricate lies

260
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,479
Take my life

261
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,199
I always thought you were a good person

262
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,640
But when it comes to yourself,

263
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,199
You have to turn around Gan Kun

264
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you ignoring right and wrong

265
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,439
Can't

266
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,680
Elder sister

267
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:01,880
Can't

268
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,520
She must die, Crown Princess

269
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,640
She must be killed

270
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:07,920
Elder sister

271
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:09,800
Elder sister

272
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,199
Elder sister

273
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,599
After entering the palace

274
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,040
I lost a sister

275
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,079
When I saw you,

276
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,719
I have a feeling of being lost and recovered

277
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,040
Just before yesterday

278
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm still thinking

279
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,239
You are so intelligent

280
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,160
You can't live up to it

281
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,959
Future

282
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,280
I should leave the mantle to you

283
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,359
But

284
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,959
You threatened the Hu family

285
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,199
Threatened the Crown Princess

286
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,280
I can't help it

287
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,880
I will be a cow and a horse in the afterlife

288
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,439
Pay for my sins today

289
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:14,920
Elder sister

290
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,439
You're confused

291
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,359
All women in the world can enter the palace

292
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,400
Sun Shi alone can't do it

293
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,959
I did all this for you

294
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,599
Even if you don't do it for yourself

295
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,599
Think about your loved ones, too

296
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,479
What are you doing

297
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,199
Zi Jin Lai

298
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,680
Are you all right

299
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Zi Jin

300
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:52,920
Your Highness

301
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,719
Take people away

302
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,119
Your Highness

303
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,319
Zi Jin

304
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,000
If I hadn't sent someone to keep an eye on Qingning Palace,

305
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,800
Are you going to hide it from me all your life

306
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,079
Your Highness, please rest assured

307
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Miss Yao is just too frightened

308
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
The body is fine

309
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,760
Allen Su will come over soon

310
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,079
Go down

311
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,119
Yes

312
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,479
I retire

313
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
There is not a word of explanation

314
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
This is going to go

315
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,719
Yao Ziliao

316
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,920
No

317
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,520
I forgot your last name is not Yao

318
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,199
Is even the name a fake

319
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,640
Your Highness is really a noble man who forgets things

320
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,680
When I saw you,

321
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
You're only ten years old

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,439
Yes

323
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:39,880
Into the palace for the first time

324
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,479
Still young

325
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,439
How many years have passed

326
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,160
Don't say your highness

327
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,479
Who else in this palace remembers who I am

328
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,400
It was your grandmother who entered the palace for you

329
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,560
Isn't it

330
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,599
Is your highness going to pursue the crime of taking the slave's name

331
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,640
I told you

332
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,599
Don't call yourself a handmaiden

333
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,199
I'm not a handmaiden now

334
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
And who is that

335
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,439
You ventured into the palace

336
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
Approaching me on purpose

337
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,319
What exactly do you want

338
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:10,959
Your Highness

339
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,119
That year

340
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,880
I went to worship Buddha with my mother

341
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,880
I accidentally met Mrs. Peng Chengbo

342
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,920
Since then

343
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,400
My wife often goes in and out of Sun's house

344
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,239
And what my mother taught me

345
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,439
It is also becoming more and more strict

346
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,800
And then I found out

347
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,439
In order to consolidate the power of the Zhang family, my wife

348
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,880
I've been looking for a girl with early wisdom

349
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,280
Carefully teach

350
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,599
In case of Tai Sun Fei's choice

351
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,719
Ultimately

352
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,199
She picked me out

353
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,520
Your Highness doesn't like playing chess with me very much

354
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Do you listen to me play the piano

355
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,680
In addition to chess, calligraphy and painting,

356
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,479
Pipa string

357
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,319
Female red cooking

358
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,959
Even Cuju riding and shooting is a cinch

359
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,199
What does your highness like

360
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,160
I will learn to be proficient

361
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,719
Not so

362
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,839
I'll be beaten

363
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Serve Your Highness

364
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,000
Live for you

365
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,760
Seems to be the only meaning in my life

366
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,160
I don't know any of this

367
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,119
Yeah

368
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,359
Such a trifle

369
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,920
How can you defile your highness's ear

370
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,359
Your Highness will never know

371
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,839
Before I entered the palace to meet the emperor,

372
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,439
What happened to the Sun family

373
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,560
Since I was the master who taught you since I was a child,

374
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,599
You have become the right election for Taisunfei

375
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,479
This is a good thing

376
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,000
Then why did she

377
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,800
She's not my master

378
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,280
She's my real mother

379
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,079
I know when I pee

380
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,680
She is my mother

381
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,119
But I never called her once

382
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,000
Because of her humble status

383
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,719
Because she will defile the lintel of Sun Shi

384
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,119
So we get along day and night

385
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,680
She held hands

386
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,800
Teach me to read and write

387
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,239
Play the piano

388
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,199
But don't let me call her mother

389
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,000
How many times do I have to blurt out

390
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,520
In the end, I didn't dare

391
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,439
She's dead

392
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Die for me

393
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,439
A man who is a great grandson's wife

394
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,959
How can anyone know

395
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,479
Her mother was born in music

396
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,760
What a proud person she is

397
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,520
She never accepted her fate

398
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,760
But she accepted it

399
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,199
For my future

400
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,079
In order to let me have a background that is not criticized,

401
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
She hanged herself

402
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,359
Your Highness

403
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,239
As far as you are concerned

404
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
It's nothing more than changing a candidate

405
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,199
As far as I'm concerned

406
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,199
It means my biological mother died in vain

407
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,920
It means her death is meaningless

408
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:05,959
I don't want it

409
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,959
I don't want to be a great grandson

410
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,119
I just want her to come back to life

411
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,439
I was wrong

412
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,800
One of the things I regret most

413
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,839
Was when she was alive

414
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,920
I didn't call her mother

415
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,599
I'm sorry

416
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,439
Zi Jin

417
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,640
Your Highness didn't ask me

418
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
Why did you enter the palace

419
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,560
Although Xu is not my biological mother,

420
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,359
But she sympathizes with my mother

421
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,319
Treat me like my own

422
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,640
She is seriously ill

423
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,040
Still holding a breath

424
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,839
Want to see me get married in style

425
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,199
But in the end

426
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,640
In the end, I waited for such news

427
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,800
Your Highness

428
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,680
Just because of this marriage

429
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,119
I lost the most important person in the world

430
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,520
So I have to go to the palace

431
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,400
I must see it with my own eyes

432
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,239
The woman who replaced me. How good is she

433
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,719
I want to ask your highness myself

434
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,199
Where on earth did I go wrong

435
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,719
You're not wrong

436
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,839
Everything is not your fault

437
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:41,839
I promise

438
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
From now on

439
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
No one will dare to hurt you again

440
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,479
I promise

441
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,359
Crown Princess

442
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,800
Your Highness, he

443
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,839
Please rest assured that the Crown Princess

444
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
Your Highness would have severely punished Hu Shangshi

445
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
But Miss Yao said

446
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,680
After all, get to know each other

447
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,079
Ask your highness for mercy

448
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,359
Your Highness has ordered Hu Shangshi to go back to meditate on his past

449
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,280
But if you do it again

450
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,119
Next time

451
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,560
Crown Princess

452
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,640
Your Highness ordered the handmaiden to send you back to the palace

453
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,079
Go out and watch

454
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,239
Yes

455
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,920
Elder sister is careless in words and deeds

456
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,640
Infuriate your highness

457
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Now you're satisfied

458
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,560
I've never nurtured a man so carefully

459
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,280
Now I will kill her with my heart

460
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,680
And for whom

461
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,839
You still don't know how to repent

462
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:34,160
Even though she was engaged to your highness

463
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,439
But now times have changed

464
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,680
Am I so narrow-minded

465
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,920
There is room for many beauties in the harem

466
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,599
Can't she be alone

467
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,640
What are you laughing at

468
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm asking you a question

469
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,800
Why not answer

470
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Emperor Taizu ruled in order to avoid the harem

471
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,560
Exclusive power of consorts

472
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,800
There are already ancestral precepts

473
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,160
After every son of heaven and prince,

474
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,000
Imperial concubines

475
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,319
Carefully select folk women with good families

476
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,599
These women who were elected to the palace

477
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,839
There is no family to rely on

478
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,400
The only thing you can rely on

479
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,479
Is the affection with the emperor

480
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,719
Taizu Xiaoci Queen Ma

481
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
Emperor Renxiao, Queen Xu

482
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,400
All of them accompanied their husbands to fight

483
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,599
Has made indelible contributions

484
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
In the heart of the emperor

485
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,079
Even if the world is stunning

486
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,560
It's not as good as having a wife

487
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,959
Emotions of mutual affection

488
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,640
Crown Princess

489
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,560
Now let me ask you something

490
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,959
What is your affection with the prince

491
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,160
The prince is surrounded by beauty

492
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
But I never despised my wife

493
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,239
He is not such a person

494
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,719
Wife

495
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,119
Don't forget

496
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,439
You are immersed in your own grief

497
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,640
Almost injured the prince by mistake

498
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,400
What kind of love is there between husband and wife

499
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,119
Think about it

500
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,160
Know Sun Shi's misfortune and dedication

501
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,520
The prince will give birth to infinite guilt and pity

502
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,319
The only thing you should be thankful for is taking the lead

503
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,239
Early determination of birthright

504
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,079
Otherwise, Sun Shi will appear

505
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,040
Where can you stand?

506
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Stop talking about it

507
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
This harem is changing rapidly

508
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Even if there are merits, it may not be safe

509
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,400
Queen Zhang today

510
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,959
Stay with your husband all the way

511
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,280
From the prince's son to the throne as emperor

512
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,560
Saved him in danger many times

513
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,680
But now in this harem,

514
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
There is one more Guo

515
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,920
Founding hero family

516
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,439
Young, beautiful and sacred

517
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,119
He also gave birth to three princes

518
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,959
Your Majesty became the imperial concubine as soon as he ascended the throne

519
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,400
What kind of person is Queen Zhang

520
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,079
Isn't it forbearance and concession everywhere

521
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,520
How are you better than Queen Zhang

522
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,239
It's time for the Crown Princess to wake up

523
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,599
You have been ordered to monitor the East Palace

524
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,000
But only record my good deeds

525
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:19,160
Aren't you afraid of the first emperor blaming you

526
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,599
I fear

527
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,479
When Your Majesty was in the East Palace,

528
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,119
Someone who has something to do says

529
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,719
Your Highness knows how to slander people

530
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:27,920
Your Majesty's Cloud

531
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,040
I don't know

532
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,880
Knowing as a child ear

533
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,880
Knowing that there are often people behind them telling slanderers to the first emperor

534
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,520
Alienate the royal family between father and son

535
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,560
Your Majesty is tolerant and generous

536
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,880
Only the filial duty of being a son

537
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,160
Minister

538
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,239
Naturally, I only do my duty as a courtier

539
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,280
So you are

540
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,760
Is it loyal to the first emperor

541
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,560
Or loyal to me

542
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,640
Your Majesty

543
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,280
Five Northern Expeditions by the First Emperor

544
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,680
Entrust the country as much as possible

545
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,160
You are sympathetic to the people, the country and the benevolence

546
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,880
Who doesn't admire the civil and military affairs of the Manchu Dynasty

547
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,000
How can I allow villains to frame up

548
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,199
As a result, the national foundation collapsed

549
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,880
As a royal guard

550
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Fulfill the duty of supervision

551
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,760
Record and hear

552
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,920
Hear and hear

553
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,479
If a word is not true

554
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,839
I am willing to be punished

555
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Almost wronged loyal ministers

556
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,359
Get up

557
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:26,560
Yes

558
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,400
Wang Jie resigned due to illness

559
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
I order you

560
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,160
Lead the Royal Guards Command

561
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,040
Don't betray my trust in you

562
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,079
The minister was ordered

563
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,920
Chen Ding Liver and Brain Tu Di

564
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,280
Live up to the grace

565
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:53,959
Your Majesty

566
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,520
It's time to eat

567
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:56,920
Go ahead

568
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,719
Yes

569
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Miss Yao refused to accept it

570
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,879
She said

571
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,959
This Feng Pei doesn't belong to her

572
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,159
From now on

573
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,399
Meals in the East Palace

574
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,360
It's up to you to take care of it

575
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,800
Hu Shang Shi

576
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,919
The meals of the prince and princess

577
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:12,679
They used to name each other

578
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,439
Zi Jin

579
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,879
The company begged me for a long time

580
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,399
I promised to let you through

581
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,360
You have to do a good job

582
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,719
Don't ruin my reputation

583
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,120
Yes

584
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,719
The company is usually in charge of some

585
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,120
Small things about firewood and charcoal

586
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
Why do you want to tune the past

587
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,120
Who is going to transfer to the company

588
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,520
Holy Oracle

589
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,040
From now on

590
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,479
Meng Shangshi returned to Shangshi Bureau

591
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,360
Still in the official position

592
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,399
Master Jing

593
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:03,760
In this way

594
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,679
Shang Shi Bureau

595
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,919
There are two adults who are still eating

596
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,959
Shang Food Bureau's Division of Food

597
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,600
Division IV, Department of Yun, Department of Pharmacy

598
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:11,639
Heavy responsibility

599
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,520
Since Emperor Taizu's time,

600
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,600
I set up two people who still eat

601
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,600
Now

602
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
It's just following the old rules

603
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,080
Is there anything wrong with it

604
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,719
Congratulations to Meng Shangshi

605
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,000
He Xi Meng Shang Shi

606
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,120
Master Jing

607
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,199
I appreciate Yao Ziliao's cooking skills very much

608
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,239
Want to keep her in the catering department

609
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,399
What do you think

610
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,399
Meng Shangshi is both

611
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,439
Still in charge of the Food Bureau

612
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,520
All the staff are under your control

613
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,159
All right

614
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,560
Let's go your separate ways

615
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,760
Yes

616
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,879
That's great

617
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,000
Zi Jin

618
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,719
Meng Shangshi sits in the town

619
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,159
We can feel much more at ease in the future

620
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:16,800
Master Jing

621
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,159
At the beginning, you were

622
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,159
Promised me personally

623
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,600
Let me take charge of the food bureau

624
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Monteggia's bullying

625
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,120
I don't even pay attention to me in the past

626
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,320
How can I help her

627
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,360
This holy oracle

628
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,439
I'm just following the orders.

629
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,040
People who even hate empresses

630
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,479
How can I see your majesty

631
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,520
Is it Guo Guifei

632
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,760
This official doesn't know

633
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,879
Master Jing

634
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,399
You want to stay out of it

635
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:47,679
I'm afraid it's not that easy

636
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,840
Since I took charge of the Food Bureau,

637
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,439
Handle a large number of current accounts

638
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,800
If Monteggia returns to power,

639
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,439
Once it is checked,

640
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,479
It is inevitable that adults will be involved

641
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,959
You threatened me

642
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,479
Dare not

643
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,800
Take care of yourself

644
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,800
I told you before

645
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,959
Jing Quan is insatiable

646
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,840
You shouldn't get too close to him

647
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,199
At the beginning, I was only in charge of the Shang Food Bureau

648
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,080
If you don't give him some benefits,

649
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,320
How can you

650
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,679
Be promoted to Shangshi so quickly

651
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,439
Meals should enter the population

652
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,320
Don't let any mistakes be made

653
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,439
As a kitchen

654
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
For one's own sake

655
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
Crime of indulging others

656
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,159
What other qualifications do you have for cooking

657
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,080
A Wai

658
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,560
You weren't like this before

659
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,520
I thought you said

660
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,080
Can be contended for or won

661
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,320
But you won't forget

662
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
The bottom line of being a man

663
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,919
You now

664
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,479
Remember before you

665
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:54,520
Have you said anything

666
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,159
Bottom line

667
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
People only need to take the first step

668
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,399
Crossing the bottom line

669
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,320
That's a matter of time

670
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,040
But you can rest assured

671
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,800
If something really happens,

672
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760
I'm the only one to bear it

673
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,639
It won't involve you

674
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
This is the period of filial piety

675
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,080
A rudimentary diet

676
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,560
Please forgive your highness

677
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,439
Grandpa Huang has always been

678
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,080
To red tape

679
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,000
Sneer at one's nose

680
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,199
But

681
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,679
If he knew

682
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,840
Father now has green vegetables and tofu all day long

683
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,040
I'm afraid I'm too happy

684
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,080
And don't talk

685
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,679
Seems

686
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,639
You really hate me

687
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,719
If there were people in the world

688
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,639
Master my destiny

689
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,719
Causing me a lifetime of pain

690
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,080
I will kill it

691
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,000
Your Highness speaks heavily

692
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,040
Handmaiden dare not

693
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,000
I dare not

694
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,439
Still don't hate

695
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,199
Even if you have the power to reach heaven,

696
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,000
There's no way to get your mother

697
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,760
Bring the dead back to life

698
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,879
Then

699
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,159
Is there anything else I can do for you

700
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,399
Your Highness

701
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Time has changed

702
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,159
I have no regrets

703
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,280
I think

704
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:54,800
A woman who has been hired by the royal family

705
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
It is impossible to marry again

706
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,840
Become a monk

707
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:02,840
Or die

708
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,760
I have no complaints

709
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,280
I'm telling you

710
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,080
It is impossible

711
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,840
I won't let you go

712
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,040
I don't care if you are Yao Ziliao

713
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,719
What kind of Sun Shi is it

714
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,760
I will never let you go again

715
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,439
Yuan Qi

716
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:36,800
Yuan Qi

717
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,159
Your Highness

718
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,159
Take the inkstone away

719
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,040
Yes

720
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:10,800
Don't put it on

721
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,679
I won't eat

722
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:15,199
You keep saying you can't

723
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:15,800
Don't complain

724
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:17,199
It's all excuses

725
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,840
How

726
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,879
You become so timid now

727
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:22,719
Don't even dare to say a word of truth

728
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,080
Yes

729
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,600
What

730
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,959
It's all lies

731
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:33,120
I abhor Your Highness, I abhor the Imperial Palace

732
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,399
Hate what brings me bad luck

733
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,000
All people

734
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,639
Your Highness

735
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,479
I hate you

736
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,479
If your highness doesn't decapitate his head

737
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,760
The handmaiden stepped down

738
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,239
Inkstone

739
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,320
I'm sorry

740
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,959
I scared you

741
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,639
Eat more

742
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,199
I'm really angry

743
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,199
All right, all right

744
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,239
What a coincidence, Miss Yao

745
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,399
We meet again

746
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
It is still in filial piety

747
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,399
Your Majesty is vegetarian

748
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,919
You beast will be punished, too

749
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,159
This is the prince's inkstone

750
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,399
How can adults punish at will

751
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,919
The emperors are keeping filial piety

752
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:48,879
How can the prince be an exception

753
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:50,800
Give it to me

754
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:53,080
Lord You

755
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,320
Birds fly in the sky and fish swim in the shallow bottom

756
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,520
These are common sense in the world

757
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:01,080
Why don't you go to Shanglin Garden

758
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,360
Forcing tigers and leopards to eat fast

759
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,280
Help Zhuang Fei achieve her wish

760
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:14,040
And borrow the hand of the crown prince

761
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:15,280
Tide over the difficulties smoothly

762
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:16,879
That's a good way

763
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Just deliberate

764
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,760
Seek the heart of the East Palace

765
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:24,280
But at the time of a great victory,

766
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Do not hesitate to admit everything

767
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,239
Self-destruct the Great Wall

768
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,399
Do you know that you're doing this

769
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,840
Equal to the prince

770
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,239
Pushed back to Hu's side

771
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,800
Your Excellency has to monitor the East Palace

772
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:37,360
Who gave the courage

773
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,000
Emperor

774
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,320
I'm not spying

775
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,479
I want a promotion

776
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:45,639
It is natural to please the prince

777
00:44:46,439 --> 00:44:47,520
How can you do it without knowing him

778
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,040
It turns out that adults' secrets

779
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,840
More than me

780
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:56,840
So two people full of secrets

781
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,800
Can you cooperate

782
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,639
My Lord is joking

783
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,520
The work of Royal Guards

784
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,879
I can't do it

785
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Your enemies are difficult to deal with

786
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm afraid you haven't gained a firm foothold yet

787
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,439
He lost his life first

788
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,360
Think it over

789
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,959
I'm waiting for your answer

790
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,479
Laugh when you want to cry

791
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,280
It's really stupid
