1
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,720
Father

2
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:45,519
Out

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,160
Father

4
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,319
Out

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,599
Dad

6
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,039
What are you laughing at

7
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
Grandpa Huang doesn't have to waste time

8
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,160
You asked Lord Xia to accompany me to visit the countryside

9
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,919
Understand the sufferings of the people

10
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:27,639
Lord Xia always forced me to eat with millet

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,639
I have a grudge in my heart for a long time

12
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,639
So I sent someone to visit secretly

13
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,919
Trying to find evidence of his guilt

14
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,240
But the people I sent came back and told me

15
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:40,479
There are only cloth and earthen wares in Lord Xia's house

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,119
Nothing else

17
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,800
In fact, it is only a trivial matter for Xia Yuanji to kill or

18
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,199
That

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
What is a big deal

20
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,960
Grandpa Emperor

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,279
You have been ill twice

22
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,759
Long live your grandchildren

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,240
Your grandson will go for you on this northern expedition

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,160
Good or not

25
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,399
Life is 100 years old

26
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,080
There are many things in the world

27
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
But they are all gone

28
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
There is no smell

29
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,320
Yan Hui-san

30
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,119
Fame has been passed down for generations

31
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,360
I want to create meritorious service for all ages

32
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,320
Why a centenarian

33
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,919
But you can't go

34
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,479
Grandpa Emperor

35
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,119
I can rest assured that the North Expedition

36
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,039
Because you stayed in Beijing

37
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,720
I can't risk Daming's future

38
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,200
Arutai

39
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,320
Invade every year

40
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,359
People are suffering

41
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,399
I often think about it

42
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
The cone center is piercing

43
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,079
They scolded me for being overjoyed

44
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,679
By him

45
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,079
Scold me for being militaristic

46
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,160
Also by him

47
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:52,880
I

48
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,959
Even if there is a eternal stigma behind him,

49
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,959
Never allow an inch of Daming land to be trampled on

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,480
Not to mention the displacement of Daming people

51
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,480
Children

52
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Your father has read a lot of books of sages

53
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,079
Be fooled by a bunch of book beetles

54
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Since you think

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,079
That old thing in the household department is still useful

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,839
I'll leave it to you

57
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:35,760
Grandpa Emperor

58
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
You have been on the throne for more than 20 years

59
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,160
All nations come to Korea

60
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,000
Try to ask the past dynasties

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,559
With the respect of the son of heaven

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Personal expedition to the desert

63
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,320
How many people are there

64
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,239
Your mind and vision

65
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,600
Is it known to the finches under the porch

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,239
There are few eagles in the world

67
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,959
How many short-sighted finches are there

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Wear thousands of clothes

69
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
Is not to wear flattery

70
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,160
What other nice words are there

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,399
You

72
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,440
Have you finished what I asked you to do

73
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,239
Don't do it yet

74
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,000
Go ahead

75
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:23,920
Zhan Ji

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,959
When Grandpa Huang wins, he will return to the DPRK

77
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,799
We went hunting together

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,559
Yes

79
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,600
Retirement of grandchildren

80
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,519
April of the 22nd year of Yongle

81
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,160
Zhu Di led hundreds of thousands of troops

82
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,760
The fifth personal expedition to Mobei

83
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,440
Order the Crown Prince to supervise the country

84
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,279
June

85
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,600
Daming Army Arrives at Dalan Namur River

86
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,799
Arutai fled when he heard the wind

87
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,679
The Ming army searched the valley for 300 miles and got nothing

88
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,000
The army is short of food and grass

89
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,839
Zhu Di ordered the squad

90
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,160
July

91
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,559
Holy driving to Yumuchuan

92
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,239
Zhu Zhanji returned to Beijing by secret order to raise grain and grass

93
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,720
Soon

94
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,119
A piece of news that can shake the world

95
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,119
Follow

96
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,040
Yao palm meal

97
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,600
Don't you have anything to say to me

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,920
Handmaiden fear

99
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,760
You don't have the slightest look of fear on your face

100
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,320
I return to Beijing in March

101
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,760
I met Grandpa Huang and left in a hurry

102
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,440
I returned to Beijing in May and stayed for three days

103
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,239
I deliberately didn't summon you

104
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,000
I just wanted to see if you'd come to me

105
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,559
I haven't seen you for so long

106
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,880
There is nothing to say

107
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,000
Your Highness

108
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,799
This braised rabbit meat

109
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,320
It was specially cooked for your highness by the Shang Food Bureau

110
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,599
Hu Shangshi made it by himself

111
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,760
I can't believe you put me

112
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,919
The rabbit I brought back to you all the way

113
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,599
Be cooked

114
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,400
Your Highness, this

115
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,520
I'll write to you

116
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
You didn't reply to me until a month late

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,719
Let someone bring you a gift

118
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,760
How dare you make it braised in soy sauce

119
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,919
With a dedicated female official like you

120
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,239
It's really moving

121
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:13,799
What are you laughing at

122
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
Your Highness

123
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,320
This is the other one

124
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:19,159
The one my highness gave me has long since run away

125
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,919
How can you stay until now

126
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,200
I haven't been back to Beijing for so long

127
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,039
You don't miss me at all

128
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:30,960
Your Highness

129
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,760
I

130
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,719
Your Highness

131
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,440
Say

132
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,320
Your Highness

133
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,119
Your Highness

134
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,559
Stay in Shangshi Bureau

135
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,640
Don't go anywhere

136
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,359
Your Highness, Father

137
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,760
You left too suddenly

138
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,559
My son is heartbroken

139
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Your Highness, don't do this

140
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,880
Great grief hurts my body

141
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
You should take good care of yourself

142
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,760
Your Highness

143
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Your Highness

144
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,000
Father

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Where's the emperor and grandson

146
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,280
Back to the words of the Crown Princess

147
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,000
Yang Rong and Hai Shou's Secret Report to Beijing

148
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,239
As soon as Emperor Taisun learned the news,

149
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,840
I reported it to His Royal Highness the Prince

150
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,840
I immediately left Beijing to welcome the funeral

151
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,000
Once the ruling and opposition parties hear about it,

152
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,359
Everyone will be afraid

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Send my orders

154
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,080
Blocking messages

155
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,159
Waiting for the emperor's grandson to return to Beijing in Fengzi Palace

156
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,559
Go to mourning again

157
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:14,640
Yes

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
Emperor

159
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,520
August of the 22nd year of Yongle

160
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,239
The Crown Prince sent Taisun Yingzi Palace to Kaiping

161
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,880
Military mourning

162
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,880
Be careful

163
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Why don't you come down first? Come down

164
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,200
Hurry up

165
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,679
Grandpa Emperor

166
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,640
Clearly agreed to return from the expedition

167
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,200
You, my grandparents and grandchildren will go hunting in Nanhaizi

168
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,320
Now the old bow is still there

169
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,239
But where did your old man go

170
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,359
You have made a promise in your life

171
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,719
Never break a promise to others

172
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,159
But why only this time

173
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
And you lied to me

174
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,479
Why

175
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Your Majesty's Register

176
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:34,799
Your Majesty

177
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,400
What

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,679
Your Majesty

179
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,840
Taizu collapsed and died

180
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,280
Forty concubines in the harem

181
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
All body martyrdom and burial

182
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,400
According to the ancestral system set by Taizu

183
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,960
All the concubines in the harem

184
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,919
All must be buried underground

185
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,280
How many people

186
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,919
Sixteen people

187
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
All must be buried

188
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Your Majesty

189
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,760
Wait a minute

190
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,200
Please tell the empress

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
Families of concubines who are buried

192
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,440
Give preferential treatment according to the old rules

193
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,640
Father and brother hereditary Royal Guards

194
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,919
Princess Zhuang has served the first emperor for a long time

195
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,119
It's better to send her on the road

196
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,039
Go ahead

197
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,559
Yes

198
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,440
You can't go in there

199
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
The queen has a life

200
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,840
Be especially kind to Empress Zhuang Fei

201
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,400
Besides

202
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,679
The concubines must eat enough before going on the road

203
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,400
Why bother Princess Zhuang, you two

204
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,679
Empress Zhuang Fei

205
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,400
This is the walnut cheese you mentioned many times before

206
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,599
You try it

207
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Is it the same taste as before

208
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,799
Not the same

209
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,599
Walnut cheese made with my mother

210
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,960
Not the same

211
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,559
Help me

212
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,039
I beg you to help me again

213
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,599
Empress Zhuang Fei

214
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,440
You get up quickly

215
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,599
You have touched us many times before and remembered it in our hearts

216
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,960
But we are just small palace maidservants of the Food Bureau

217
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
Martyrdom is an ancestral system

218
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,520
How can we help

219
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,880
Deadline for human burial

220
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
It was after sunset today

221
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
You help me get out of the palace

222
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,599
Help me out of the palace

223
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:52,919
Empress Zhuang Fei

224
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:53,760
You

225
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,719
The Queen won't see us

226
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,840
I can't plead with her

227
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,599
I'm not I'm not running away

228
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,359
I just want to meet my mother

229
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,079
She has no son

230
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,000
No one to rely on

231
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,599
I don't ask for anything else

232
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,479
I just need to see her once

233
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,439
Even if it is said that

234
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,319
Say the last farewell words

235
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,839
I'll just say goodbye and come back

236
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,520
I'm begging you to help me

237
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
I'm begging you to help me

238
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,839
Please, please

239
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,560
I'll just say one word and I'll be back

240
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,920
I

241
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,160
I just want to see my mother one last time

242
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,239
Even with such a little request,

243
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,359
Can't satisfy me

244
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,160
You want to leave the palace

245
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,439
Empress Zhuang Fei

246
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,040
There are only three people now

247
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,359
If you don't come back before sunset

248
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,239
The three of us will lose our lives

249
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,760
You have a way to get me out of the palace

250
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,520
That's great

251
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,319
I swear

252
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,239
I will definitely come back

253
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,160
I swear I'll be back

254
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,239
Well, before sunset

255
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
Yao Ziliao

256
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,599
Know I'm going to die

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,680
Use this kind of thing to perfunctory me

258
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,719
Fuck off

259
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,959
Get out of here, all of them

260
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,199
Get out of here

261
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,079
Fuck off

262
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:50,839
Empress

263
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,520
Everybody out

264
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
What are you doing, Empress

265
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,479
Empress calms one's anger

266
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,239
Empress calms one's anger

267
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,000
Handmaiden will redo it and send it

268
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,479
It's Thursday today

269
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,719
There was supposed to be an inner city outside Xuanwu Gate

270
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,760
You can go out with a waist tag

271
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,959
But there has been a strike during the funeral

272
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,359
Entry and exit

273
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,359
Most of them are people who go to various prisons and bureaus to do business

274
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,719
Go all the way through the long street

275
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,160
Encounter patrol guards

276
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,599
Show them the waist tag

277
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:35,839
Just say

278
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,800
The number of sauces sent by the wine and vinegar noodle bureau is wrong

279
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,239
Hu Shangshi sent you to ask

280
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,439
Next

281
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,280
Waist tag

282
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,599
What are you doing

283
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,719
It's in line

284
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,520
It's clear that I came first

285
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
What's wrong with me standing in front

286
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,959
You are unreasonable.

287
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,599
Do you know what this place is

288
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Wanton noise

289
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,079
Get out of here

290
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:03,959
Take away

291
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,560
Let's go

292
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,000
Go

293
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,839
It wasn't her first

294
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,359
Go

295
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,359
Out of Xuanwu Gate

296
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,839
The really sad one is at Bei'an Gate

297
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,520
How kind of a girl you are

298
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
A dying man

299
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,400
I really redone it and sent it

300
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,160
Is the dying man

301
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,239
Why bother with her

302
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,359
Be full

303
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,719
It's better to hit the road later

304
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,479
Go inside

305
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,040
Why

306
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,280
Yeah

307
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Why

308
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,560
It used to be profitable for me to help her

309
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,880
But now she is going to be buried soon

310
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,520
Is a useless person

311
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,719
Why are you

312
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:11,400
To take such a big risk to help her

313
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,959
What are you looking at me for

314
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,239
Am I wrong

315
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,880
Clearly follow the steps said by Empress Zhuang Fei

316
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
To make walnut cheese

317
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,119
Why does it taste different

318
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,199
People are going to die

319
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,680
What to eat is different

320
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:34,920
Good

321
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,040
Even if you say so

322
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,199
She went out of Xuanwu Gate smoothly

323
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,479
But how can she get out of Bei'an Gate

324
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,160
I heard that the eighteen red shops there

325
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,520
Hundreds of guards

326
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,079
You can't escape with your wings

327
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Zi Jin

328
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,599
We're going to get people back now

329
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,880
You can also atone for your merits

330
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,839
How is it

331
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,000
Zi Jin

332
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:01,800
Zi Jin

333
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Is it these walnuts that are the problem

334
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,760
Yao Ziliao

335
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,000
And only you would believe her

336
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,880
If it were me,

337
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,079
Have a chance to escape

338
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,040
Why don't I run away at once

339
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
The empress will come back

340
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,280
She never broke her promise

341
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,400
In the face of the threat of death

342
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,880
Anyone will become selfish and cowardly

343
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,040
There is no exception

344
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,280
Clearly you don't have to come in to deliver food

345
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,199
Then why did you come

346
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:30,839
Not afraid of death

347
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,560
You will be afraid by yourself

348
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:37,839
Purple Azolla

349
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,719
Will come back

350
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,479
I knew it

351
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,719
Who will take the initiative to come back and die

352
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,239
Liar

353
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,520
Yao Ziliao

354
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,119
You fool

355
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,719
Go

356
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:17,880
Go quickly

357
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,079
Hurry up

358
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,359
There is also Zhuang Fei, the master of Yongning Palace

359
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,439
Go quickly

360
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Miss Yao

361
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,400
Palm lamp

362
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,599
They'll be here soon

363
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:44,959
Quickly

364
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:45,839
It's right ahead

365
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,239
Don't delay the time.

366
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:47,640
Yes

367
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,359
You go

368
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,640
You go now

369
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,760
Purple Azolla

370
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,199
You don't have to worry about implicating other people in Yongning Palace

371
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,119
I stay

372
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Why do you say that

373
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,959
I should have been a dead man

374
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,000
I will pay you my life this time

375
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,280
You and I will not owe each other in the future

376
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,239
What does this mean

377
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,520
The night our whole family died

378
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,160
I was the only one who escaped from life

379
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,280
You think

380
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,239
The man who opened the cricket can in those days

381
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,160
Is it really my brother

382
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,280
People who know you are kind now

383
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,839
What kind of monster is it?

384
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,599
You go quickly

385
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,239
I'm not leaving

386
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:44,880
You go

387
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,280
Purple Azolla

388
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,040
Open the door

389
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,359
Yes

390
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,880
Why is it plugged in

391
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:55,959
Knock

392
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,839
Yes

393
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,079
Open the door. Open the door

394
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:00,880
Open the door quickly

395
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:01,719
Open the door

396
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,199
Open the door

397
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:03,959
Crash open

398
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,479
Yes

399
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,319
I will serve your majesty

400
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,640
Dress up yourself

401
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,599
Who allowed you to be so presumptuous

402
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,439
No rules

403
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,839
Empress Zhuang Fei

404
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,160
Please

405
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,959
I thought Princess Zhuang was gone forever

406
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,439
But

407
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,800
How on earth did she get out of Bei'an Gate

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,560
Zi Jin

409
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,400
Zi Jin

410
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,040
Zi Jin

411
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,479
Zi Jin

412
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,119
What's the matter

413
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,760
Don't you like hemp fiber cake best

414
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
So delicious hemp fiber cake

415
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Eat it at ordinary times

416
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,800
I can't help swallowing the hemp fiber cake with my tongue

417
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,719
I don't know why

418
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,520
It doesn't taste good at all now

419
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,959
This is when I made walnut cheese for Zhuang Fei

420
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:10,920
The rest of the ingredients

421
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,079
What's the matter

422
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,359
Where do these come from

423
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,040
Liaoxian Mianwalnut and Lingbao red jujube

424
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,479
They are all excellent tributes

425
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,680
Here it is

426
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,199
This is the ingredients sent by the pharmacy department to make medicated diet

427
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,920
Although the nuts are big,

428
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,719
But it is far less sweet and crisp than cotton walnuts

429
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,959
It's still a little astringent

430
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,760
What is this for

431
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,079
It's not too late to make walnut cheese now

432
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,640
It's for Princess Zhuang

433
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,760
The number of ingredients sent recently has become more perfunctory

434
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,920
Fragrant rice and dried fruit antlers

435
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,520
There are problems with the number of seafood in the East China Sea

436
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,520
Wang Sishan resolutely refused to accept it

437
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,199
If it weren't for the handmaiden perfunctory

438
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,319
I am afraid I have already asked Guanglu Temple

439
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,880
I see

440
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,640
I'm afraid Wang Sishan is opinionated

441
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,800
In case she knows

442
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll take care of it

443
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,719
Yes

444
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,439
Where did Zi Jin go today

445
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,400
You check it out

446
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,319
I'll go by myself

447
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,199
Empress

448
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:27,160
Empress

449
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,680
Zi Jin

450
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,199
Don't be rude

451
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,959
Zi Jin

452
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,839
Empress Zhuang Fei

453
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:43,319
The handmaiden made you walnut cheese

454
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,800
You try it

455
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,880
Wang Si's meal

456
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,959
I just want to do my last thing

457
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,880
Zi Jin

458
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,439
Purple Azolla

459
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,280
Quickly

460
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:47,680
Right

461
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,640
When I was a child in Jiangnan

462
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,800
This is the taste of walnut cheese made by my mother

463
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,160
Empress

464
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,599
No matter how excellent the ingredients are,

465
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,119
The most beautiful taste in the world

466
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,040
It is the memory of my hometown

467
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,479
I'm sorry

468
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,160
I lied to you

469
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,800
I walked out of the Forbidden City

470
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,319
I didn't want to come back

471
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,319
But the bearers scared away

472
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,920
I can only carry my mother behind my back

473
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,839
Knocking on the door from house to house

474
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,719
Can cling to our relatives in the past

475
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,400
No one dares to resist the decree

476
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,560
But my feet

477
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,160
It's not far away

478
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,680
Even if I give birth to wings,

479
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,479
I can't fly out of here

480
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,800
Empress should hit the road

481
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,840
My last moments in this world

482
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,399
It's warm

483
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,560
Empress

484
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,120
The Emperor arrives

485
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:54,800
Your Majesty is here

486
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,560
Did Your Majesty come specially to see him off

487
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,479
I am willing to die today

488
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,360
I implore Your Majesty to remember your promise

489
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,679
Take care of my mother for me

490
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:40,159
Don't let her be displaced

491
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,399
No branches to follow

492
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,879
Your Majesty

493
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Ancestral system can not be violated

494
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,560
Zi Jin

495
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,159
Mother

496
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,479
I went

497
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,800
Empress

498
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,679
Empress

499
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,639
Empress

500
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,679
Empress, are you all right

501
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,679
Down

502
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:17,679
Now

503
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
Do you understand everything

504
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,360
Presumptuous

505
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,760
Concubines can only be buried without children

506
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,959
After the courtiers, they were saved from death according to the law

507
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
What's more

508
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,600
Your Majesty is now in good health

509
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,639
I just

510
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,479
I just can't bear it

511
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,320
I was born for Emperor Taizu in those days

512
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,840
There are also concubines who have given birth to children

513
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,040
Why don't you think about it

514
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:50,399
Who will decide your destiny in the end

515
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,120
You

516
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,199
Empress

517
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,879
Your hands are shaking all the time

518
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,239
Send you back to the palace, handmaiden

519
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,800
Purple Azolla

520
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,520
Purple Azolla

521
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,239
Yin Ziping

522
00:39:59,479 --> 00:39:59,919
Purple Azolla

523
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,800
Zi Jin

524
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,280
Quick, quick, quick

525
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,800
You come back

526
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,280
What are you doing

527
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,800
Don't you know how to get out of Bei'an Gate

528
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,040
Nowadays, the whole country holds mourning and crying sacrifices

529
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,080
We still have a chance

530
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,040
Go, go, go

531
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,080
You come here

532
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,959
You tell me

533
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:16,120
Why did you leave

534
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,800
Sacrificial burial

535
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:21,520
Only concubines were buried

536
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,040
We are the palace maidservants of the Shang Food Bureau

537
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,560
Then you promise me

538
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,360
Don't care about the emperor and grandson anymore

539
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,120
Let's not be concubines anymore

540
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,479
Be a good female official

541
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,399
Good or not

542
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,080
Purple Azolla

543
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,120
Ronghua Fugui Fresh Clothes and Gourmet Food

544
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
No matter how precious everything is,

545
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,919
They are insignificant in front of life

546
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Look at today's situation

547
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm afraid you will follow in the footsteps of Zhuang Fei

548
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:46,520
Rest assured

549
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,000
I won't

550
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
Become a concubine

551
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
If there are no children

552
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,639
Possible martyrdom

553
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,120
Become a female official

554
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Row difference and step wrong

555
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,600
Worry about one's life

556
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,479
Walk out of the palace gate today

557
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,679
There is no way to lead

558
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,959
The whole city is under martial law

559
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
How to get out of Beijing

560
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:12,800
Unaccompanied woman

561
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,120
How to make a living

562
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:16,360
Even if you set up a career,

563
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,000
How to preserve

564
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,000
Zi Jin

565
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,719
What can we do

566
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,239
Is it the king's land under the whole world

567
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,719
Don't Princess Zhuang want to escape

568
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,280
She wants to

569
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:35,120
But where did you escape in the end

570
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,080
Even if you really escaped,

571
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,719
That is also Zhulianjiu clan

572
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,600
Flee

573
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,120
You can never escape

574
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,000
Since you can't escape,

575
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:50,840
Then stay

576
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,120
Purple Azolla

577
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,879
It's the wrong burial

578
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,800
Is the world wrong

579
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,600
Mistakes must be corrected

580
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,159
But it's an ancestral system

581
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,600
Even today's prince can't openly

582
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,280
I'm not afraid

583
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:05,679
Purple Azolla

584
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,239
Don't be afraid, either

585
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:10,600
Whenever you remember four words

586
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,239
Man-made things

587
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:15,560
You think about it

588
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,040
Whether you are a female official,

589
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Or be a concubine

590
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,280
Even the most ordinary people

591
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,439
Who has no dilemma

592
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,320
There will always be a way out

593
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,479
Wherever you go

594
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,560
How far do you go

595
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,719
As long as someone is with you

596
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,800
Not alone

597
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,000
Have this belief

598
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,560
It can support me for a long time

599
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,120
End

600
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,399
Maybe it's the way out

601
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,320
Hu Si Shan

602
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,159
This is the medicated diet spectrum I wrote

603
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,840
Take time to look at it for me

604
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,080
She gave Princess Zhuang a jade pendant

605
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,560
Just walked out of Bei'an Gate safely

606
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
What kind of jade pendant
