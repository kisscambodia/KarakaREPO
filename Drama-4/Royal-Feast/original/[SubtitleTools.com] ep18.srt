1
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,040
Why on earth is Yao Ziliao

2
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,800
Su Yuehua

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,760
You can't afford to lose, can you deliberately provoke

4
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
Ziping, tell me why you won

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
You speak

6
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,319
People should be willing to gamble and admit defeat

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,919
Purple Azolla

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,440
Purple Azolla

9
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,800
You mustn't talk

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,559
At that time, the empress was clear

11
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,880
There must be something wrong with this

12
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,080
You tell me

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,039
What the hell did you do

14
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,839
Wang Mocha loves to attend Zen and worship Buddha

15
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
But the real Wangchuan map

16
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,679
There are boat tourists

17
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,440
Only there are no monks

18
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,559
Monk

19
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,399
The old monk under the tree

20
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,279
Emperor Taizu once entered Huangjue Temple as a monk

21
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,399
I hate people the most in my life

22
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,440
Hang bald monks on your lips

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,839
If anyone in the Forbidden City dares to say a word,

24
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
The consequences are unimaginable

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,759
But now times have changed

26
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,279
Few people in the palace remember this taboo

27
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,240
But the empress knows it well

28
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,479
How can I let you win

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,039
It turns out that you are deliberately misleading me

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,399
Su Yuehua

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,639
People catch rats in their own homes

32
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,600
Who let you keep good people wrong

33
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,119
You have to get in at one end

34
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,320
Purple Azolla

35
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,880
It's just a small skill to carve insects

36
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,679
Today's competition

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,639
I am the one

38
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,360
I won

39
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,600
Moon flower

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,839
What do you think is the hardest part of the real Wangchuan map

41
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,759
Is it really to reproduce the artistic conception in the painting

42
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,039
Isn't it

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,919
Wang Chuan map sample

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,720
It is indeed the most exquisite fancy cold dish in the world

45
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,440
It's a pity to meet the cold season

46
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,639
Be blown by a cold wind

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,679
All the ingredients will become more and more cold and hard

48
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,360
The function of viewing is far greater than eating

49
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,440
I had already thought about it

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,679
Use the method of carving and preserving flowers in Jingzhou, Huguang

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,880
Make all the ingredients into candied fruit in advance

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,160
For noble people to taste

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,759
What a pity

54
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,040
You stole the painting

55
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
Everything I can think of

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,279
You will not think of it in advance

57
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,799
Because you put all your thoughts

58
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,519
It's all on showing off skills

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I forgot that the ingredients will eventually be imported

60
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,200
The picture of Wangchuan has been beautifully restored

61
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,880
If you use this talent in the side door,

62
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,519
Then you are on the road of cooking

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,920
It really stops there

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,640
Zouziliao

65
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,720
Ignore her

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,959
I can't see it

67
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,559
That's awesome

68
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,079
Lord You

69
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,640
Believe whatever I draw

70
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,279
You can't really be so naive, can you

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,519
Let's go

72
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,480
That's boring

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,559
You can't afford to lose

74
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,119
All right

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,519
The person sent for the painting did not look closely at the painting

76
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,519
I told her to make a trap

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
But it's interesting for you to come and go

78
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Just lost once

79
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,119
Why do you look so ugly

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,959
She has never been so serious

81
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
What the hell happened

82
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,519
The high-rise buildings on the city are cut too clearly

83
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,600
Late coming overlooking Enigmatic

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
Xishan is green and connected with the East China Sea

85
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
Nanji Zhouche Club Beijing

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,920
Red brocade gardens should shine at night

87
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,279
Huang Yun sees Qiu Cheng in Longmu

88
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,279
The sky is vast and clear

89
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,959
Watching Feihong Wanli Levy

90
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
How

91
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,440
Good poetry, good poetry

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,040
Your Highness

93
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,559
Climbing the stairs and overlooking last night

94
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,799
Is there a beauty on the boat

95
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,079
What kind of eyes

96
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,760
Where does the beauty come from in the dead of night

97
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,679
It's more like having a female ghost

98
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
It looks more and more like a person

99
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,239
Full of nonsense

100
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,920
But where is it like when you believe in a pen

101
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,239
It's not like

102
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,399
Handmaiden's eyesight

103
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Wrong, wrong

104
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,920
Damn handmaiden damn handmaiden damn

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,799
Damn handmaiden

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Your Highness

107
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Hu Shangshi was my carelessness

108
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,000
Please forgive me

109
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,799
Just now, a will came from Kunning Palace

110
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,840
From now on

111
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,039
You are no longer the standard meal of the Shang Food Bureau

112
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,520
Hu Shang Shi

113
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,760
Please allow me to have a second chance to compete

114
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
You have already lost the first game

115
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
I dare to talk big

116
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,960
Don't go out yet

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,200
If you lose again in the second game

118
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,559
What to do

119
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,799
Just me

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Can beat Yao Ziliao

121
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
What kind of person is she

122
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
It's not worth mentioning at all

123
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,640
If it were me

124
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,760
I can give you one last chance

125
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,640
But if you lose again this time

126
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,239
He left the Shang Food Bureau forever

127
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,039
Yes

128
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,520
The Knife Skill of Su Dian Food

129
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
It's really a little superb

130
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
You see

131
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
The mountains and the waters

132
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,559
It's really a bit of the artistic conception of the original painting

133
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,679
Descendants of famous chef Su

134
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
Nature is extraordinary

135
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,200
What a pity

136
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,960
The Queen intended to help Hu Shanwei

137
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,960
Nature will not judge fairly

138
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,960
The old monk who participated in Zen meditation

139
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,080
Can predict the Queen's mind so accurately

140
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,039
You still have Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the Food Bureau

141
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
The tricks of young people can't hide from the eyes of empress

142
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,000
Wang Mocha's Wangchuan Map and the Old Monk Participating in Zen

143
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,080
It also brings out the best in each other

144
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,280
It's just a competition in the second game

145
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,200
It is not up to the empresses of the harem to decide

146
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,159
What the imperial concubine means is

147
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
The East Palace will invite the important ministers in the DPRK on behalf of the emperor

148
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,559
Youtai liquid pool

149
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
What about the competition in the second game

150
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
It was set in Xiyuan

151
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:11,919
Your Highness

152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,559
Golden Jade Soup Just Delivered

153
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,400
I know you don't like it too sweet

154
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,640
They were specially ordered to release little honey

155
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,559
Only seasoned with sweet-scented osmanthus

156
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,320
You try it

157
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,440
Your Highness

158
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,960
Recently, it is either writing or drawing

159
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,760
Don't you have to deal with government affairs

160
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
I seldom have time to spend more time with you

161
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,719
Isn't it good

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,200
Once upon a time, when the first emperor was there,

163
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,000
Not to take you north to hunt

164
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,760
Is to force you to assist in government affairs

165
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
You can't finish reading the throne

166
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,280
Even I can't see you

167
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,039
Now your highness has free time

168
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,239
I am naturally glad

169
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,359
It's just that my father didn't ascend to the throne long ago

170
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,280
There are many government affairs

171
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,719
Your Highness, as a country, Chu Jun

172
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,039
It should be shared for him more

173
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,919
If he is willing to let me help him share it, then

174
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,239
Your Highness, it's time to get cold

175
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm tired

176
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,440
Crown Princess

177
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,640
Your Highness, he

178
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,919
It seems that everything in the past

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,640
Your Highness has never forgotten for a moment

180
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,119
Temple

181
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,599
There is no burning of felt

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
What kind of Lei Gong chestnut to simmer

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
Start, start, start, start

184
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,239
Come on with pleasure today

185
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,039
Be sure to enjoy yourself and return home

186
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,000
Your Highness, look

187
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,159
Your Highness

188
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,040
Your Highness

189
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,359
The emperor has come up

190
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,079
Big Brother Big Brother

191
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Your Highness, isn't the emperor ill

192
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,280
Here comes the Holy Drive

193
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,560
Notify the kitchen

194
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,319
Prepare meals

195
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,239
Yes

196
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,719
Father

197
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,520
See Your Majesty

198
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,280
Avoid

199
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,119
Thank Your Majesty

200
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Quick, quick, quick

201
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,640
Quickly

202
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,479
Put this over there

203
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
Come here, this way

204
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,760
Gently, gently

205
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,040
Don't disturb the Holy driving

206
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:13,880
Father-in-law Zhao

207
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,880
Noble people don't have ears

208
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,000
How can you hear it at such a distance

209
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,839
Your boy is too long, isn't he

210
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,280
Do what you should do

211
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,800
Father-in-law Zhao

212
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,599
Just let them do these little things

213
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
Why bother you to order yourself

214
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,599
Last time Your Majesty came to Xiyuan

215
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,319
Eat something cold

216
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
The cold wind blew again

217
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,160
As a result, I went back to a serious illness

218
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,160
So the Queen asked me to come this time

219
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,439
Is to charge you

220
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,119
These wild birds bear fruit

221
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,680
Be sure to be extra careful

222
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,599
Please rest assured that Father Zhao will understand

223
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,920
Those two are busy first

224
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,400
It's a good sword

225
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,880
The sovereign listened to your words

226
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,199
The first one is advised in the above table

227
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
Sure enough, he won the favor of the emperor

228
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,640
You don't have to send anything to me in the future

229
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,280
I don't lack anything

230
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,839
Sovereign charge

231
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,880
Be careful in everything

232
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,880
This is the wind and cold

233
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,079
The prince will entertain you on my behalf

234
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,199
Then the King of Zhao came

235
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,119
Our brothers have been for a long time

236
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,199
There is no swimming in Xiyuan together

237
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,319
So today, everyone is together

238
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,359
As soon as your majesty ascended the throne,

239
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
It increased the age of my brother

240
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
Imperial grace is so mighty

241
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,160
My brother is grateful

242
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,239
Naturally, I want to go to the palace to give thanks

243
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,160
We're brothers

244
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,199
Don't be polite

245
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,640
Come and sit down

246
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,719
Brother Xie Huang

247
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,719
Ayan

248
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,400
Come here

249
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
When you finish the copybook I sent you,

250
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,239
I'll take you to release the eagle, okay

251
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,319
Really

252
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:52,920
Wei Wang grew up

253
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,280
I am very close to His Royal Highness the Prince

254
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,880
My favorite person in the world is Big Brother

255
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,680
Brother Emperor

256
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,160
Although the prince is young,

257
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,359
But quite prestigious

258
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,760
And won the hearts of the people

259
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,400
Even King Wei admired him so much

260
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,839
No wonder my father used to tell us when he was around

261
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:20,599
This one day Taiping Son of Heaven also

262
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,680
What I care most about on weekdays

263
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,520
Is the sufferings of the people

264
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,199
Object discussion between the government and the public

265
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:59,160
You all serve the first emperor

266
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,800
A loyal minister for more than 20 years

267
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,760
It is the pillar of the country

268
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,479
If there are any omissions in my future administration,

269
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,359
I hope you guys

270
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Take out this seal for correcting mistakes

271
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,199
Dense and sparse to smell

272
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,520
I

273
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,640
Be sure to consider it

274
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,640
I give you this seal

275
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,199
I just want to get along honestly between the monarch and his subjects

276
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,640
The last thing I like is flattery

277
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:36,079
What I love most is the truth

278
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
From the heart

279
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,160
I wait for a decree to thank you

280
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,800
Ai Qing

281
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,800
What advice do you have

282
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,800
Your Majesty's administration is clear and there is no deficiency in political affairs

283
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,359
How dare I speak nonsense

284
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,640
Zhong Ai Qing

285
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,000
It is a good thing that my father can ask for words in coachable

286
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,239
But it's hard to relax in the garden today

287
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,760
Why don't you leave government affairs for the time being

288
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,680
Wait for them to consider it carefully

289
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:26,920
It's not too late to give advice to my father

290
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,280
His Royal Highness is right

291
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,160
Your Majesty, please let me wait and think about it

292
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,880
As soon as I ascended the throne, I gave an order of admonition

293
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,920
But today

294
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,479
There is no admonition of loving Qing

295
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,839
Good

296
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,640
Just

297
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,359
Everybody up, please

298
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,439
Thank Your Majesty

299
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,079
The fish tuna is really delicious this season

300
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,359
Father

301
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,040
Fish tuna is delicious

302
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,959
But it's a fishy thing after all

303
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,079
Extremely cold in the stomach

304
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,359
Fear of hurting dragon body

305
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,479
Get out of here

306
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,920
Eat less oil and don't eat too much

307
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,520
In case you get sick

308
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
How can you accompany me to release the eagle

309
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,400
Isn't Big Brother delicious

310
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Big Brother, this is crisp and delicious

311
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,000
Mingming tastes best

312
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,160
Excuse me, is Yao Zhang's meal there

313
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,439
I am

314
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,000
Meng Shangshi has orders

315
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,239
Please come with me, girl

316
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,640
Is this cold

317
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,000
Sure enough

318
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Melt at the entrance

319
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,280
This chicken piece is still very white and delicious

320
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
Cook chicken in light vinegar in advance

321
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
To be so fragrant and tender

322
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,680
What's the use of this copper coin

323
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,359
Miaomiaomiao

324
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,119
Antler vegetables with porridge have excellent flavor

325
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,599
Please taste it, Your Majesty

326
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,160
Common practices of mandarin fish porridge are not common

327
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,359
Brother, this is really interesting

328
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,160
It's just a round monk porridge in Yi Jianzhi

329
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,959
Read a few idle books

330
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,560
Dare to show off before the command

331
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,719
That's interesting

332
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,959
If you love reading, you are an elegant chef

333
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,239
Brother, you are so strange today

334
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,560
See nothing pleasing to the eye

335
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,160
How on earth did this kitchen offend you

336
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,439
Do I have

337
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:27,839
You're wrong

338
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,040
What did Hu Shangshi tell you to do

339
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,040
What are you talking about

340
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,680
Meng Shangshi didn't tell me to lead you there

341
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,959
Meng Shang Shi

342
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,239
Serving the emperor for dinner

343
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,800
Those who come to send messages must be the command's people

344
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:01,479
You see

345
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,319
Your boots are covered with mud

346
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,319
It is also worthy to serve in front of the emperor

347
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,599
Somebody come

348
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,400
Somebody, there's an assassin

349
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,160
Somebody, please

350
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,199
There is another person

351
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,520
There are moles under the eyebrows

352
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,599
Short in stature

353
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:09,920
It's going that way

354
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,319
Don't chase it yet

355
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,199
Yes

356
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,040
What did I say

357
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,479
How can you back down

358
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,680
People still can't tolerate you

359
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,599
Don't you come now

360
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:53,880
Thank you, Lord You

361
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,040
How

362
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:03,880
Blood

363
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,760
The more you rub, how can you meet people

364
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,119
And now

365
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,719
Can you still see it

366
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,839
Don't you go soon

367
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,719
What's the matter, Xiao Shi

368
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,400
Let me check

369
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
And move me to see

370
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,760
What's going on

371
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,079
Xiao Shi

372
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:13,880
Ayan

373
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,359
Xiao Shi

374
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,839
Don't come over. Get out of the way

375
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:17,760
Ayan

376
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,160
Xiao Shi

377
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,959
You get up

378
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:19,719
Your Highness

379
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,839
A-a-a-a-a

380
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:23,520
Ah, ah

381
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:25,839
Ayan

382
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,479
Go to Xuan Tai Yi quickly

383
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:30,520
Yes

384
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,040
Ayan

385
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,719
Blockade Xiyuan and prohibit anyone from entering or leaving

386
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,160
Yes

387
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,199
Is there anything unusual before King Wei goes out

388
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,199
No, no, no

389
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,680
Your Highness was just fine

390
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,719
What's wrong with this

391
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,280
It's antler

392
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,119
Your Majesty, it must be the antler

393
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,319
Who allows you to talk nonsense

394
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,160
Antler grows in Shan Ye

395
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,959
It is inevitable to be contaminated with snake venom

396
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:04,400
Mung bean soup must be scalded before eating

397
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,359
Now His Royal Highness King Wei is poisoned

398
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm afraid they have neglected this

399
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,320
Your Majesty is careful in cooking

400
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,919
There would never be such a big mistake

401
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:17,080
Or please ask the Imperial Doctor to treat His Royal Highness Wei Wang quickly

402
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,360
All the kitchens involved will be won

403
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,239
Who cooked the antler today

404
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,879
They

405
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,520
What happened

406
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,399
Take away

407
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Why are you arresting people for no reason

408
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,639
What are you doing

409
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Go, go, go

410
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,199
What did I do

411
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,760
Let go

412
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,520
Let go of me

413
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,919
Cut the crap

414
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,479
What the hell have we done

415
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,679
Let go of me

416
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,479
What's going on here

417
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,600
Quickly

418
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,000
Sister

419
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,280
You can't go. You can't go

420
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,080
What the hell happened

421
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,679
Hu Shang Shi

422
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,399
Events of the Day

423
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:34,600
Hu Shang Shi

424
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,360
Fresh antler from here

425
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,719
They were all scalded with mung bean soup

426
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,120
Meng Shangshi and Ziping were wronged

427
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,760
I have narrowly escaped death

428
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,600
There is still time to care about other people's lives and deaths

429
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,199
You are really an extraordinary person

430
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:49,879
The feud between you and me

431
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,639
After all, it has nothing to do with business

432
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,439
Meng Shangshi and others were imprisoned

433
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,040
The Food Bureau must have lost its reputation

434
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,080
The errand of entering imperial food

435
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,639
It must be taken by the food supervisor

436
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,280
Then what good will it do to you

437
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,520
Meng Shang has no way to eat

438
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,760
This makes a big mistake

439
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,520
When I officially take over in the future,

440
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
Will regain the right to eat

441
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,080
You don't need a little palm meal

442
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,479
Royal Guards

443
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,600
Not from the rest of the antler

444
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,959
Find out any problems

445
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,199
How can you be so sure

446
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,320
Snakes and insects crawl through venom residues

447
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,919
Who can guarantee the dish that King Wei took

448
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,879
No problem

449
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,679
Moon flower

450
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,520
You've been in the kitchen the whole time

451
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,320
You should see it with your own eyes

452
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,959
All the antler vegetables

453
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,639
They are all cleared with mung bean water

454
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,159
I didn't see anything

455
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,239
Moon flower

456
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,239
On the menu of that dish

457
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,959
Only Yin Ziping and Fang Hanying

458
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,280
Let you get away with it

459
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,639
But don't forget

460
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,959
There will be no Meng Shang to protect you in the future

461
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,719
If you come to provoke regardless of honor or inferiority,

462
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,719
Hugh blames me for being ruthless

463
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,679
Moon flower

464
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,280
I can win by strength

465
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,159
Why bother to make trouble

466
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,239
You don't think

467
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,360
Am I the one who tampered with the antler

468
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,040
It was their own negligence

469
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,439
I ran into the emperor's favorite youngest son

470
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,719
It's a day to die of her

471
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,159
If the doctor diagnosed

472
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,360
Is it true that King Wei's illness has nothing to do with them

473
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,719
Wei Wang suddenly fell into a coma after eating

474
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,639
How did they get away with it

475
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,919
Yuehua, you should know

476
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,600
This matter is not man-made

477
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,919
Everything is God's will

478
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,879
What we've done

479
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,360
It's nothing more than standing by and watching

480
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,360
Do you understand

481
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,479
Yes

482
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,199
Imperial concubine empress

483
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,320
Wei Wang's disease

484
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,919
Wearing a court sentence

485
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,199
Everyone in the palace knows it

486
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,479
My son was in good health before he went to the garden

487
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,360
He ate poisonous antler

488
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,159
Empress, this minister also dare not make an assertion

489
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,639
This is not the time to investigate the cause

490
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,080
The most important thing is

491
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,560
Is to cure Wei Wang's illness

492
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,159
Sister Yao

493
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:48,719
Evergreen

494
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,000
I've asked someone I know

495
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,719
Wei Wang is seriously ill with high fever

496
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,320
His Majesty himself prayed for him

497
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,679
Waiting all night again

498
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,560
It's just that the doctor can't find out the cause

499
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,919
Meng Shang's food is afraid of being in danger

500
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,000
Don't wait

501
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,919
I want to see the Imperial Concubine

502
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,800
I really have something to say

503
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,840
Now Wei Wang is seriously ill

504
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,800
The imperial concubine is angry with Meng Shangshi

505
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,719
Don't say you can't see it

506
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,000
Even if you saw it,

507
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,080
I'm afraid I have to fold myself in

508
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,919
Evergreen

509
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,080
Then you tell me

510
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,919
What kind of symptoms do Wei Wang have

511
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,080
How could I know that

512
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,320
Let's go

513
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,600
It's not just Meng Shang who eats them

514
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,800
There is also Guanglu Temple in Shanglinyuan

515
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,919
Anyone involved in this matter will be implicated

516
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,600
I can't take care of it

517
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,560
You have been waiting here for two hours

518
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,320
You have done your utmost

519
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,560
Go home

520
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,080
Let's go

521
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,600
Evergreen

522
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,520
Let's go

523
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,760
Your Majesty

524
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,959
Although your highness has taken the poison-clearing decoction,

525
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,879
But he is too young

526
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,919
Now the head and face are swollen

527
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,239
Pulse floating number

528
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,919
I'm afraid I can't stand it

529
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,479
Your Majesty

530
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,239
Coco, on his back

531
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,040
Toxic backlog in lungs

532
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,479
There is redness, swelling and heat pain

533
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,399
Your Majesty Ayan is the most like you

534
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,760
Usually sickly

535
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,919
How do you think he can stand the pain

536
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,800
I want to spend it safely this time

537
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,639
I really can only ask God for mercy

538
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,840
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, is worried about King Wei's illness

539
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,120
Please see again and again

540
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,919
See, see, let him go back

541
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,040
Yes

542
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,080
Your Majesty, you said Ayan is good

543
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,239
How can you suddenly be poisoned

544
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:12,320
Someone must have a grudge against male and female servants and concubines

545
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,080
Deliberately wanted Ayan's life

546
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:24,919
His Royal Highness the Prince

547
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,399
Your Majesty said please ask your Royal Highness to go back first

548
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,760
When Wei Wang's illness has improved,

549
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:31,800
Again

550
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,360
Let's go, Chen Wu

551
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Prince Boxing Heart

552
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,800
Please transmit it to your majesty

553
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:20,360
Quickly

554
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,320
Go to report Hu Shangshi

555
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,159
Yes

556
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,080
Empress Empress

557
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,040
There is still a grievance in the Food Bureau

558
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,600
To play in person

559
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,879
How dare you

560
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,120
How dare you stop the Queen's ceremonial ceremony

561
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,879
Don't retreat yet

562
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,360
Empress still has grievances in the Food Bureau

563
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,800
Please ask the Empress to redress her grievances

564
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,000
Somebody drag her down

565
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:12,800
Empress

566
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,320
Emperor Taizu set up drums outside the Wumen Gate

567
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,919
Allow the wrongdoers in the world to complain to the holy man

568
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:21,120
Empress Xiaoci and Empress Renxiao followed the example of the imperial court

569
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:23,560
Open up a wide range of ways to rehabilitate grievances in the harem

570
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,560
But now the grievance is in front of the empress

571
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,959
How can the empress sit idly by

572
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,159
Don't stop her mouth yet

573
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:30,120
Empress Empress

574
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:30,959
Wait a minute

575
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,800
Handmaidservant. See Synonyms at Empress

576
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,719
Monteggia made a big mistake by omission

577
00:44:46,439 --> 00:44:47,719
You're still here to redress her grievances

578
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,679
Take away

579
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:49,600
Hu Shang Shi

580
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:52,919
Can you assert in front of the empress

581
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,760
There is really no grievance

582
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,280
Why can't I argue

583
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:57,639
Don't take it away yet

584
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:58,719
Hu Shang Shi

585
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,840
Empress Empress

586
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,520
Don't listen to this woman's gossip to confuse people

587
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:05,080
She is a Monteggia henchman

588
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,800
Will do everything possible to excuse her

589
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,239
The handmaiden will send her to Miyagi

590
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:10,280
Make an example of others

591
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,040
She mentioned Queen Filial Piety just now

592
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,000
Empress Ren Xiao

593
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,879
If you don't listen to her redress

594
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,080
But I am heartless and unkind

595
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,239
Emperor Taizu, the empress, has long said clearly

596
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,239
Only those who have great grievances and confidential feelings can shout grievances

597
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,360
There are still people in the harem who deliberately falsely accuse

598
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,199
Involve innocent people

599
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,840
How can her words be accepted

600
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,879
Besides, this person shouted in front of the temple and collided with the phoenix driver

601
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,320
Violate palace rules

602
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,479
Collision Phoenix Drive

603
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
Handmaiden is willing to receive punishment

604
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,120
Just ask the Empress to redress her grievances

605
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:39,800
You have to think it over

606
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:41,439
If you go back on your word when you are punished

607
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,760
It will be punished as causing trouble for no reason

608
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,199
By that time

609
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,320
I will send you to Gongzhengsi for a higher punishment

610
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,000
Ask the Empress to fulfill it

611
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,199
Empress

612
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:55,199
Good

613
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,000
I help you
