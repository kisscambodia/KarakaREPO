1
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,401
August of the 22nd year of Yongle

2
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,560
Zhu Gaochi, Prince of Daming, ascended the throne as Emperor

3
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:28,160
Make Crown Princess Zhang Queen

4
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,321
And canonized Guo as the imperial concubine

5
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,600
Zhu Zhanji, the great grandson of the emperor, is the crown prince

6
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,121
Hu is the crown princess

7
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:11,761
Zi Jin

8
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,880
The Crown Princess's Palace sent people

9
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,240
Previous days of crying sacrifice

10
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:16,761
Crown princess is weak due to qi deficiency

11
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:17,440
Have a cough

12
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,121
Hu Shang's index finger name asked you to make a medicated diet and send it

13
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,640
Yes

14
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
The civil and military ministers advised him to enter five times

15
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,681
Your Majesty has just promised to ascend to the throne

16
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:36,800
According to etiquette

17
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,240
It has been more than 27 days in mourning

18
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,561
Officials who are in a hurry to change clothes

19
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
But I miscalculated

20
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,281
After all, father and son are United

21
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,041
So is the prince

22
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,121
I heard you coughed badly yesterday

23
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,401
Don't hold on

24
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,800
Or please ask the medicine manager to come and have a look

25
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,281
I was too tired a few days ago

26
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:56,640
Blood stasis and heat are in it

27
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,520
I caught a cold again last night

28
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:00,360
Just rest for a few days

29
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,721
Don't make a fuss

30
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,040
Or is your health important

31
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,240
Handmaiden, I'll make you a cup.

32
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,841
Ganfengling developed by Tai Hospital

33
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,161
You drink first

34
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:10,961
Good

35
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:14,281
Then it's good to feel the wind these days

36
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,961
Or are you the most considerate

37
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,480
It's very hot

38
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm feeling chest tightness and polydipsia

39
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,121
The Crown Princess has been coughing for a long time

40
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,200
Lotus leaf porridge clears heat and moistens lung

41
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,681
Please have a try

42
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Inside are sweet-scented osmanthus and taro puree

43
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,281
Yes

44
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,841
Cinnamon is fragrant and refreshing

45
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Taro benefits stomach and spleen

46
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,961
But the Crown Princess is weak and has spleen deficiency

47
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:30,561
Taro is prone to abdominal distension

48
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,360
Not multi-purpose

49
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,320
This lotus leaf porridge is very good for me

50
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,121
Today's meal is light and delicious

51
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,360
Give it to the Crown Prince as it is

52
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,001
Yes

53
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,920
Crown Princess

54
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,601
Be careful to lead the wolf into the house

55
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,281
Exemption from Yongle's 22-year hukou salt grain

56
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,961
Horse grass, firewood and charcoal are in arrears everywhere

57
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,360
Since December of Yongle 20 years ago,

58
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:10,640
Do your best to avoid

59
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,601
Add another one

60
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,601
Escape to people everywhere

61
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:17,320
Be forgiven for one's sins

62
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,441
Send back to the place of origin to resume business

63
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Avoid the difference for two years

64
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,360
Taxes and grain owed by their households

65
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,001
Do your best to avoid

66
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:38,480
Father

67
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,200
I'm just going to buy everywhere

68
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,601
Is that why you're here

69
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:46,841
Father stopped in Xishima and Yunnan

70
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,320
Acquisition of cross toes

71
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,561
It's all a matter of caring for the people

72
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,961
My son has no objection

73
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:54,520
Only the return of Nanjing

74
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,401
I also ask my father to think twice

75
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,121
Who said it was all returned

76
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,240
Who said it was all returned

77
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,121
You know before I say it

78
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,360
Are you sending someone now

79
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,320
Peep at my every move

80
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,520
Father calms his anger

81
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:15,281
I just heard that my father ordered people to go south

82
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,961
When repairing Nanjing Imperial City, I dared to speculate

83
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,881
After the great funeral of Grandpa Huang,

84
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:22,800
Father may intend to return it all

85
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,080
If my son guessed wrong

86
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:25,520
I also ask my father to forgive me

87
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:30,920
Since moving the capital

88
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:32,681
South-to-North Grain Transfer

89
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,721
Wasting people and money

90
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,760
Arutai is constantly disturbing and causing trouble

91
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,401
Nanjing

92
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,161
It is the capital set by Taizu

93
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,681
Return to Nanjing

94
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,200
That is to follow the old system of our ancestors

95
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:51,001
Father

96
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,040
Beijing is the land of Longxing

97
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,561
Natural barrier and geographical advantage

98
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,640
Grandpa Huang moved the capital here

99
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,001
It is to respect the son of heaven

100
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,601
Guard the gate of Daming

101
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,841
System 4 razes the world and achieves the foundation of the world

102
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,161
It's easy to return it in a hurry

103
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,760
Grandpa Huang's painstaking efforts will be destroyed

104
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:10,841
Father

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The man that Grandpa Huang wants to kill

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
Regardless of the severity of the crime

107
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,401
You will be forgiven

108
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,161
The national policy he set

109
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,041
It is also a change of course one by one

110
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,241
Run in the opposite direction everywhere

111
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,721
Why on earth

112
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,161
Prince

113
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't rely on the favor of the first emperor

114
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,880
You can be so presumptuous to me

115
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,320
Grandfather loves me

116
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,680
Just because the people in the world who can understand him

117
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,601
Just me

118
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,080
Grandfather's ambition father doesn't understand

119
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll never understand

120
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:45,841
You just want to be a king of benevolence and righteousness

121
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,921
But now the country's biggest future trouble is not removed

122
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Rely solely on benevolence and righteousness

123
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,200
Unable to govern the world

124
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
Then you tell me

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,401
What is the future trouble

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,560
A captaincy

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,961
What I do

128
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,801
You don't have to worry about it

129
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,520
Get the hell out of here

130
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:16,841
Get out of here

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,801
My son retires

132
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,401
Continue

133
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,961
Yes

134
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,200
At that time, the Royal Guards were ordered by the Imperial Examination

135
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,361
Supervise the East Palace

136
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,481
Where is the volume

137
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,401
When Grandpa Huang wins, he will return to the DPRK

138
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,241
We went hunting together

139
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:29,000
Your Excellency

140
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,120
We have been ordered to monitor the East Palace

141
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,361
Now the new emperor has succeeded to the throne

142
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,161
Will you settle accounts after autumn

143
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,281
Kneel down

144
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,760
Hu Shang Shi

145
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:47,841
What does this mean

146
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,120
Crown Princess

147
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,601
Handmaiden specially came to plead guilty today

148
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,361
Handmaiden is lax in royal control

149
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Let Yao Ziliao commit the great crime of privately longitudinal Zhuang Fei

150
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,241
Private longitudinal Zhuang Fei

151
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,161
Before Zhuang Fei was buried

152
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,401
Yao Ziliao took advantage of the meal delivery machine

153
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:04,721
Privately vertical Zhuang Fei out of the palace

154
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,520
This matter is proved by Ajin, a maid of Yongning Palace

155
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,161
Now the harem is initially decided

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,880
Empress Empress is busy with everything

157
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,401
Handmaiden dare not disturb

158
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,000
Specially came to ask the Crown Princess to decide

159
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,281
Hu Shang Shi

160
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,320
Do you know what a sin it is to falsely accuse

161
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:25,801
Even if you were my elder sister

162
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I won't be light either

163
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,120
Ah Kin

164
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,841
How dare you hide it in front of the Crown Princess

165
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:33,241
Is it desperate

166
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,801
Crown Princess

167
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,640
It was Miss Yao who gave her master a jade pendant

168
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,320
Just walked out of Bei'an Gate safely

169
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,120
What jade pendant

170
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:50,080
A phoenix that only a queen can have

171
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,281
The Bei'anmen guard is an old man in the palace

172
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:54,640
Once you see this pendant,

173
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,601
Panic is still less than enough

174
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:57,880
How dare you stop it

175
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,161
General Chen Lao promised to keep his mouth shut

176
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,721
On returning to the palace

177
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,880
But you need to leave Pei as evidence

178
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:08,000
Yao Ziliao

179
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,640
Where did you get it

180
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,601
It is said that this Feng Pei was carved by the first emperor himself

181
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,161
Empress Renxiao carries it with her day and night

182
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,320
Seeing Pei in the palace is like seeing the Lord

183
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,640
You can't obey orders

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,801
Empress Renxiao personally raised the prince

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,161
Grandparents and grandchildren have deep feelings

186
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:27,520
After she died

187
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,120
Leave Yu Pei to the First Emperor

188
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,401
Indicate that you should leave it to your future grandson-in-law

189
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,041
You said

190
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,000
This jade pendant

191
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Why is it in the hands of a female official

192
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,241
Yao Ziliao

193
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,640
Who the hell are you

194
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:47,640
Your Highness

195
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,801
Tell her to come

196
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:56,880
Your Highness

197
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:58,680
I want to see her

198
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:00,361
Yes

199
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,200
What is it

200
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:20,961
Your Highness

201
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,680
General Chen Lao, the guard of Bei'an Gate

202
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,361
Know that your highness is waiting for the catalpa palace day and night

203
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Never dared to disturb

204
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,560
Heard about your highness's return

205
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,760
There is one thing to offer

206
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:48,041
Why don't you answer

207
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:52,560
Yao Ziliao

208
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,560
She was the first emperor of that year

209
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,281
The princess set for the prince

210
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,120
Mrs. Peng Chengbo

211
00:15:58,481 --> 00:15:59,161
Crown Princess

212
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,801
Sun Shi is ten years old

213
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:10,161
She was introduced to the palace by Mrs. Peng Chengbo

214
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,440
Raised by Queen Zhang today

215
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,080
Six months later

216
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,560
Sun Shi came out of the palace with illness

217
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,241
Stay in Yongcheng for illness

218
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
You can only get married when you grow up

219
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,801
Who knows that the first emperor complied with the destiny

220
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,841
Change you to be your princess

221
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,640
Sun Shi is narrow-minded

222
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,560
A serious illness

223
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,200
After the first emperor learned about it,

224
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:31,200
Be greatly unhappy

225
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,481
No one has dared to mention her since then

226
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:35,801
Crown Princess

227
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,320
I told you that you are kind and righteous

228
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,841
See it now

229
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,760
You have been blinded by this snake and scorpion woman

230
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,560
She concealed her identity and entered the palace

231
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,921
Lurking by your side

232
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,721
What exactly is the purpose

233
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:49,841
It speaks for itself

234
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:53,520
Hu Shang Shi

235
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,760
You and I get along for a long time

236
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,241
Have I ever done a bad thing

237
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,000
Killed a man

238
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,401
Don't you dare say

239
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,601
You concealed your identity and entered the palace

240
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,520
It's not for another purpose

241
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,721
Crown Princess

242
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,961
This woman stays in trouble

243
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,161
Can't be tolerated

244
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,241
I know you can't be ruthless

245
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,080
I'll do it for you

246
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:23,281
Bearer

247
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:27,520
Are you really going to kill me

248
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,841
Hu Shang Shi

249
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,041
Hu Shang Shi

250
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,841
Palm meal Yao Ziliao

251
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:56,841
With intent to murder the Crown Princess

252
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,001
Not allowed to be interrogated by Gong Zhengsi

253
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,841
Has committed suicide by taking poison

254
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,160
Crown Princess

255
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:11,641
The evidence is here

256
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:16,841
Crown Princess

257
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,761
Previous

258
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:20,040
You want to take my identity

259
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,601
Now we have to fabricate lies

260
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:24,440
Take my life

261
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,160
I always thought you were a good person

262
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,601
But when it comes to yourself,

263
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,160
You have to turn around Gan Kun

264
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,961
Are you ignoring right and wrong

265
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:35,400
Can't

266
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:36,641
Elder sister

267
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,841
Can't

268
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,481
She must die, Crown Princess

269
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:41,601
She must be killed

270
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,881
Elder sister

271
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,761
Elder sister

272
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:50,160
Elder sister

273
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,560
After entering the palace

274
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,001
I lost a sister

275
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,040
When I saw you,

276
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,680
I have a feeling of being lost and recovered

277
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,001
Just before yesterday

278
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:09,761
I'm still thinking

279
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:12,200
You are so intelligent

280
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,121
You can't live up to it

281
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:15,920
Future

282
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,241
I should leave the mantle to you

283
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,320
But

284
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,920
You threatened the Hu family

285
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,160
Threatened the Crown Princess

286
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,241
I can't help it

287
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:38,841
I will be a cow and a horse in the afterlife

288
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:42,400
Pay for my sins today

289
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,881
Elder sister

290
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:54,400
You're confused

291
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,320
All women in the world can enter the palace

292
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,361
Sun Shi alone can't do it

293
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,920
I did all this for you

294
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:03,560
Even if you don't do it for yourself

295
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,560
Think about your loved ones, too

296
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:22,440
What are you doing

297
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,160
Zi Jin Lai

298
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,641
Are you all right

299
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:27,841
Zi Jin

300
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,881
Your Highness

301
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:31,680
Take people away

302
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:33,080
Your Highness

303
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:51,280
Zi Jin

304
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,961
If I hadn't sent someone to keep an eye on Qingning Palace,

305
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,761
Are you going to hide it from me all your life

306
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:10,040
Your Highness, please rest assured

307
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:11,961
Miss Yao is just too frightened

308
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:13,881
The body is fine

309
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,721
Allen Su will come over soon

310
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,040
Go down

311
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:18,080
Yes

312
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,440
I retire

313
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:50,761
There is not a word of explanation

314
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:51,721
This is going to go

315
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,680
Yao Ziliao

316
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:56,881
No

317
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,481
I forgot your last name is not Yao

318
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
Is even the name a fake

319
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,601
Your Highness is really a noble man who forgets things

320
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,641
When I saw you,

321
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:12,961
You're only ten years old

322
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:14,400
Yes

323
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,841
Into the palace for the first time

324
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:17,440
Still young

325
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,400
How many years have passed

326
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,121
Don't say your highness

327
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,440
Who else in this palace remembers who I am

328
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,361
It was your grandmother who entered the palace for you

329
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,521
Isn't it

330
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,560
Is your highness going to pursue the crime of taking the slave's name

331
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:35,601
I told you

332
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,560
Don't call yourself a handmaiden

333
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm not a handmaiden now

334
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:40,721
And who is that

335
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:42,400
You ventured into the palace

336
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:43,721
Approaching me on purpose

337
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,280
What exactly do you want

338
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,920
Your Highness

339
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,080
That year

340
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:53,841
I went to worship Buddha with my mother

341
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,841
I accidentally met Mrs. Peng Chengbo

342
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,881
Since then

343
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,361
My wife often goes in and out of Sun's house

344
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
And what my mother taught me

345
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:06,400
It is also becoming more and more strict

346
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:11,761
And then I found out

347
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:15,400
In order to consolidate the power of the Zhang family, my wife

348
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,841
I've been looking for a girl with early wisdom

349
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,241
Carefully teach

350
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:26,560
In case of Tai Sun Fei's choice

351
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,680
Ultimately

352
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
She picked me out

353
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:40,481
Your Highness doesn't like playing chess with me very much

354
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:42,881
Do you listen to me play the piano

355
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,641
In addition to chess, calligraphy and painting,

356
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
Pipa string

357
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,280
Female red cooking

358
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,920
Even Cuju riding and shooting is a cinch

359
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,160
What does your highness like

360
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,121
I will learn to be proficient

361
00:23:58,721 --> 00:23:59,680
Not so

362
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:01,800
I'll be beaten

363
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,881
Serve Your Highness

364
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,961
Live for you

365
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,721
Seems to be the only meaning in my life

366
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,121
I don't know any of this

367
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,080
Yeah

368
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:17,320
Such a trifle

369
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,881
How can you defile your highness's ear

370
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:25,320
Your Highness will never know

371
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,800
Before I entered the palace to meet the emperor,

372
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:32,400
What happened to the Sun family

373
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:01,521
Since I was the master who taught you since I was a child,

374
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,560
You have become the right election for Taisunfei

375
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,440
This is a good thing

376
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,961
Then why did she

377
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,761
She's not my master

378
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,241
She's my real mother

379
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,040
I know when I pee

380
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,641
She is my mother

381
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,080
But I never called her once

382
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,961
Because of her humble status

383
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,680
Because she will defile the lintel of Sun Shi

384
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,080
So we get along day and night

385
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:29,641
She held hands

386
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,761
Teach me to read and write

387
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,200
Play the piano

388
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,160
But don't let me call her mother

389
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,961
How many times do I have to blurt out

390
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:41,481
In the end, I didn't dare

391
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:43,400
She's dead

392
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,241
Die for me

393
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,400
A man who is a great grandson's wife

394
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:52,920
How can anyone know

395
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,440
Her mother was born in music

396
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,721
What a proud person she is

397
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,481
She never accepted her fate

398
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:01,721
But she accepted it

399
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,160
For my future

400
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:10,040
In order to let me have a background that is not criticized,

401
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:16,841
She hanged herself

402
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,320
Your Highness

403
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,200
As far as you are concerned

404
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,521
It's nothing more than changing a candidate

405
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:33,160
As far as I'm concerned

406
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:36,160
It means my biological mother died in vain

407
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,881
It means her death is meaningless

408
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,920
I don't want it

409
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:44,920
I don't want to be a great grandson

410
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:49,080
I just want her to come back to life

411
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:51,400
I was wrong

412
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,761
One of the things I regret most

413
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,800
Was when she was alive

414
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,881
I didn't call her mother

415
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm sorry

416
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:12,400
Zi Jin

417
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,601
Your Highness didn't ask me

418
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:19,721
Why did you enter the palace

419
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,521
Although Xu is not my biological mother,

420
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,320
But she sympathizes with my mother

421
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:30,280
Treat me like my own

422
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:32,601
She is seriously ill

423
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,001
Still holding a breath

424
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,800
Want to see me get married in style

425
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,160
But in the end

426
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,601
In the end, I waited for such news

427
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:47,761
Your Highness

428
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,641
Just because of this marriage

429
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,080
I lost the most important person in the world

430
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,481
So I have to go to the palace

431
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,361
I must see it with my own eyes

432
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,200
The woman who replaced me. How good is she

433
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,680
I want to ask your highness myself

434
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:11,160
Where on earth did I go wrong

435
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:12,680
You're not wrong

436
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:15,800
Everything is not your fault

437
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,800
I promise

438
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,721
From now on

439
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,001
No one will dare to hurt you again

440
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,440
I promise

441
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:51,320
Crown Princess

442
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,761
Your Highness, he

443
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Please rest assured that the Crown Princess

444
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:12,121
Your Highness would have severely punished Hu Shangshi

445
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,601
But Miss Yao said

446
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:14,641
After all, get to know each other

447
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,040
Ask your highness for mercy

448
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:19,320
Your Highness has ordered Hu Shangshi to go back to meditate on his past

449
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:21,241
But if you do it again

450
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,080
Next time

451
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:24,521
Crown Princess

452
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,601
Your Highness ordered the handmaiden to send you back to the palace

453
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,040
Go out and watch

454
00:29:41,761 --> 00:29:42,200
Yes

455
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:54,881
Elder sister is careless in words and deeds

456
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,601
Infuriate your highness

457
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:57,881
Now you're satisfied

458
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,521
I've never nurtured a man so carefully

459
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,241
Now I will kill her with my heart

460
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,641
And for whom

461
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,800
You still don't know how to repent

462
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,121
Even though she was engaged to your highness

463
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,400
But now times have changed

464
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,641
Am I so narrow-minded

465
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,881
There is room for many beauties in the harem

466
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:18,560
Can't she be alone

467
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,601
What are you laughing at

468
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:24,721
I'm asking you a question

469
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:25,761
Why not answer

470
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:28,641
Emperor Taizu ruled in order to avoid the harem

471
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:29,521
Exclusive power of consorts

472
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,761
There are already ancestral precepts

473
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,121
After every son of heaven and prince,

474
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:33,961
Imperial concubines

475
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,280
Carefully select folk women with good families

476
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,560
These women who were elected to the palace

477
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
There is no family to rely on

478
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,361
The only thing you can rely on

479
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:43,440
Is the affection with the emperor

480
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,680
Taizu Xiaoci Queen Ma

481
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,961
Emperor Renxiao, Queen Xu

482
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:51,361
All of them accompanied their husbands to fight

483
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,560
Has made indelible contributions

484
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:55,881
In the heart of the emperor

485
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:58,040
Even if the world is stunning

486
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,521
It's not as good as having a wife

487
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:01,920
Emotions of mutual affection

488
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:04,601
Crown Princess

489
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,521
Now let me ask you something

490
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
What is your affection with the prince

491
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,121
The prince is surrounded by beauty

492
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:23,241
But I never despised my wife

493
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,200
He is not such a person

494
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:28,680
Wife

495
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:33,080
Don't forget

496
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,400
You are immersed in your own grief

497
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,601
Almost injured the prince by mistake

498
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,361
What kind of love is there between husband and wife

499
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Think about it

500
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,121
Know Sun Shi's misfortune and dedication

501
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,481
The prince will give birth to infinite guilt and pity

502
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:52,280
The only thing you should be thankful for is taking the lead

503
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,200
Early determination of birthright

504
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,040
Otherwise, Sun Shi will appear

505
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:57,001
Where can you stand?

506
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:01,961
Stop talking about it

507
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,601
This harem is changing rapidly

508
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:07,361
Even if there are merits, it may not be safe

509
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,361
Queen Zhang today

510
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:10,920
Stay with your husband all the way

511
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,241
From the prince's son to the throne as emperor

512
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,521
Saved him in danger many times

513
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,641
But now in this harem,

514
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:18,761
There is one more Guo

515
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,881
Founding hero family

516
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,400
Young, beautiful and sacred

517
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:25,080
He also gave birth to three princes

518
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,920
Your Majesty became the imperial concubine as soon as he ascended the throne

519
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,361
What kind of person is Queen Zhang

520
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,040
Isn't it forbearance and concession everywhere

521
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,481
How are you better than Queen Zhang

522
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,200
It's time for the Crown Princess to wake up

523
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,560
You have been ordered to monitor the East Palace

524
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,961
But only record my good deeds

525
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,121
Aren't you afraid of the first emperor blaming you

526
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,560
I fear

527
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,440
When Your Majesty was in the East Palace,

528
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,080
Someone who has something to do says

529
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,680
Your Highness knows how to slander people

530
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,881
Your Majesty's Cloud

531
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,001
I don't know

532
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,841
Knowing as a child ear

533
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:08,841
Knowing that there are often people behind them telling slanderers to the first emperor

534
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:10,481
Alienate the royal family between father and son

535
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:12,521
Your Majesty is tolerant and generous

536
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,841
Only the filial duty of being a son

537
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:16,121
Minister

538
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,200
Naturally, I only do my duty as a courtier

539
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,241
So you are

540
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,721
Is it loyal to the first emperor

541
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,521
Or loyal to me

542
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:33,601
Your Majesty

543
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,241
Five Northern Expeditions by the First Emperor

544
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,641
Entrust the country as much as possible

545
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:39,121
You are sympathetic to the people, the country and the benevolence

546
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,841
Who doesn't admire the civil and military affairs of the Manchu Dynasty

547
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:42,961
How can I allow villains to frame up

548
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
As a result, the national foundation collapsed

549
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:45,841
As a royal guard

550
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:47,121
Fulfill the duty of supervision

551
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:48,721
Record and hear

552
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:49,881
Hear and hear

553
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
If a word is not true

554
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
I am willing to be punished

555
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,241
Almost wronged loyal ministers

556
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:01,320
Get up

557
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,521
Yes

558
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:09,361
Wang Jie resigned due to illness

559
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:11,241
I order you

560
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:15,121
Lead the Royal Guards Command

561
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:19,001
Don't betray my trust in you

562
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:22,040
The minister was ordered

563
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:23,881
Chen Ding Liver and Brain Tu Di

564
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,241
Live up to the grace

565
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:29,920
Your Majesty

566
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:31,481
It's time to eat

567
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,881
Go ahead

568
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:33,680
Yes

569
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:02,561
Miss Yao refused to accept it

570
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:03,840
She said

571
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,920
This Feng Pei doesn't belong to her

572
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:39,120
From now on

573
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,360
Meals in the East Palace

574
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,321
It's up to you to take care of it

575
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:45,761
Hu Shang Shi

576
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:47,880
The meals of the prince and princess

577
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,640
They used to name each other

578
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,400
Zi Jin

579
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,840
The company begged me for a long time

580
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:53,360
I promised to let you through

581
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,321
You have to do a good job

582
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:56,680
Don't ruin my reputation

583
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,081
Yes

584
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,680
The company is usually in charge of some

585
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,081
Small things about firewood and charcoal

586
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,481
Why do you want to tune the past

587
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,081
Who is going to transfer to the company

588
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,481
Holy Oracle

589
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,001
From now on

590
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,440
Meng Shangshi returned to Shangshi Bureau

591
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,321
Still in the official position

592
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:38,360
Master Jing

593
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,721
In this way

594
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:40,640
Shang Shi Bureau

595
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,880
There are two adults who are still eating

596
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,920
Shang Food Bureau's Division of Food

597
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,561
Division IV, Department of Yun, Department of Pharmacy

598
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,600
Heavy responsibility

599
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:49,481
Since Emperor Taizu's time,

600
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,561
I set up two people who still eat

601
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:52,561
Now

602
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:54,041
It's just following the old rules

603
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,041
Is there anything wrong with it

604
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:57,680
Congratulations to Meng Shangshi

605
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,961
He Xi Meng Shang Shi

606
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,081
Master Jing

607
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,160
I appreciate Yao Ziliao's cooking skills very much

608
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:06,200
Want to keep her in the catering department

609
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:07,360
What do you think

610
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,360
Meng Shangshi is both

611
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,400
Still in charge of the Food Bureau

612
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:14,481
All the staff are under your control

613
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,120
All right

614
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,521
Let's go your separate ways

615
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:29,721
Yes

616
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,840
That's great

617
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:35,961
Zi Jin

618
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,680
Meng Shangshi sits in the town

619
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,120
We can feel much more at ease in the future

620
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,761
Master Jing

621
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,120
At the beginning, you were

622
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Promised me personally

623
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:56,561
Let me take charge of the food bureau

624
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:00,561
Monteggia's bullying

625
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,081
I don't even pay attention to me in the past

626
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,281
How can I help her

627
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,321
This holy oracle

628
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,400
I'm just following the orders.

629
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,001
People who even hate empresses

630
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,440
How can I see your majesty

631
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,481
Is it Guo Guifei

632
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,721
This official doesn't know

633
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:18,840
Master Jing

634
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,360
You want to stay out of it

635
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,640
I'm afraid it's not that easy

636
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:25,801
Since I took charge of the Food Bureau,

637
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:27,400
Handle a large number of current accounts

638
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,761
If Monteggia returns to power,

639
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:31,400
Once it is checked,

640
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,440
It is inevitable that adults will be involved

641
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:36,920
You threatened me

642
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,440
Dare not

643
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,761
Take care of yourself

644
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:51,761
I told you before

645
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:53,920
Jing Quan is insatiable

646
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,801
You shouldn't get too close to him

647
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,160
At the beginning, I was only in charge of the Shang Food Bureau

648
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,041
If you don't give him some benefits,

649
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:01,281
How can you

650
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:02,640
Be promoted to Shangshi so quickly

651
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,400
Meals should enter the population

652
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,281
Don't let any mistakes be made

653
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,400
As a kitchen

654
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:10,001
For one's own sake

655
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,721
Crime of indulging others

656
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,120
What other qualifications do you have for cooking

657
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,041
A Wai

658
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:19,521
You weren't like this before

659
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,481
I thought you said

660
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,041
Can be contended for or won

661
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,281
But you won't forget

662
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,281
The bottom line of being a man

663
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:26,880
You now

664
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,440
Remember before you

665
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,481
Have you said anything

666
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,120
Bottom line

667
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:36,561
People only need to take the first step

668
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,360
Crossing the bottom line

669
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,281
That's a matter of time

670
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,001
But you can rest assured

671
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,761
If something really happens,

672
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:45,721
I'm the only one to bear it

673
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,600
It won't involve you

674
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:05,801
This is the period of filial piety

675
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,041
A rudimentary diet

676
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,521
Please forgive your highness

677
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:11,400
Grandpa Huang has always been

678
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,041
To red tape

679
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:12,961
Sneer at one's nose

680
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:14,160
But

681
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:15,640
If he knew

682
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,801
Father now has green vegetables and tofu all day long

683
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,001
I'm afraid I'm too happy

684
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,041
And don't talk

685
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:31,640
Seems

686
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
You really hate me

687
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,680
If there were people in the world

688
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,600
Master my destiny

689
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,680
Causing me a lifetime of pain

690
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,041
I will kill it

691
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,961
Your Highness speaks heavily

692
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:57,001
Handmaiden dare not

693
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,961
I dare not

694
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,400
Still don't hate

695
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,160
Even if you have the power to reach heaven,

696
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:07,961
There's no way to get your mother

697
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:08,721
Bring the dead back to life

698
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:10,840
Then

699
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,120
Is there anything else I can do for you

700
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:20,360
Your Highness

701
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:24,241
Time has changed

702
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:27,120
I have no regrets

703
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,241
I think

704
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,761
A woman who has been hired by the royal family

705
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:32,241
It is impossible to marry again

706
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,801
Become a monk

707
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,801
Or die

708
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,721
I have no complaints

709
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:51,241
I'm telling you

710
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,041
It is impossible

711
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:53,801
I won't let you go

712
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:56,001
I don't care if you are Yao Ziliao

713
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:57,680
What kind of Sun Shi is it

714
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,721
I will never let you go again

715
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,400
Yuan Qi

716
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,761
Yuan Qi

717
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,120
Your Highness

718
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:23,120
Take the inkstone away

719
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:24,001
Yes

720
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,761
Don't put it on

721
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:47,640
I won't eat

722
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,160
You keep saying you can't

723
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,761
Don't complain

724
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,160
It's all excuses

725
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:54,801
How

726
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,840
You become so timid now

727
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,680
Don't even dare to say a word of truth

728
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:01,041
Yes

729
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:02,561
What

730
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:04,920
It's all lies

731
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,081
I abhor Your Highness, I abhor the Imperial Palace

732
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,360
Hate what brings me bad luck

733
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:11,961
All people

734
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:19,600
Your Highness

735
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:22,440
I hate you

736
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
If your highness doesn't decapitate his head

737
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:32,721
The handmaiden stepped down

738
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:50,200
Inkstone

739
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,281
I'm sorry

740
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:53,920
I scared you

741
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:54,600
Eat more

742
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,160
I'm really angry

743
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:02,160
All right, all right

744
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,200
What a coincidence, Miss Yao

745
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:04,360
We meet again

746
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:10,241
It is still in filial piety

747
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:11,360
Your Majesty is vegetarian

748
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,880
You beast will be punished, too

749
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:17,120
This is the prince's inkstone

750
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,360
How can adults punish at will

751
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:23,880
The emperors are keeping filial piety

752
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,840
How can the prince be an exception

753
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,761
Give it to me

754
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,041
Lord You

755
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,281
Birds fly in the sky and fish swim in the shallow bottom

756
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,481
These are common sense in the world

757
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,041
Why don't you go to Shanglin Garden

758
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,321
Forcing tigers and leopards to eat fast

759
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:48,241
Help Zhuang Fei achieve her wish

760
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,001
And borrow the hand of the crown prince

761
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,241
Tide over the difficulties smoothly

762
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
That's a good way

763
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:56,561
Just deliberate

764
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:57,721
Seek the heart of the East Palace

765
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,241
But at the time of a great victory,

766
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:01,241
Do not hesitate to admit everything

767
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,200
Self-destruct the Great Wall

768
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,360
Do you know that you're doing this

769
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:05,801
Equal to the prince

770
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:07,200
Pushed back to Hu's side

771
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:10,761
Your Excellency has to monitor the East Palace

772
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,321
Who gave the courage

773
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:16,961
Emperor

774
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,281
I'm not spying

775
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:20,440
I want a promotion

776
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,600
It is natural to please the prince

777
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,481
How can you do it without knowing him

778
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:26,001
It turns out that adults' secrets

779
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:26,801
More than me

780
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,801
So two people full of secrets

781
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:34,761
Can you cooperate

782
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:36,600
My Lord is joking

783
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:39,481
The work of Royal Guards

784
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:40,840
I can't do it

785
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:42,521
Your enemies are difficult to deal with

786
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,321
I'm afraid you haven't gained a firm foothold yet

787
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:45,400
He lost his life first

788
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:47,321
Think it over

789
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:48,920
I'm waiting for your answer

790
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,440
Laugh when you want to cry

791
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:03,241
It's really stupid
