1
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,639
I need a batch of clams from Liaodong

2
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,760
Specializing in treating women's disharmony of qi and blood

3
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,279
You find out

4
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,480
Arrive in Beijing in August and September

5
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,360
Yes

6
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:01,839
Your Highness

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,199
This medicinal material for treating disharmony between qi and blood

8
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,919
It was Dr. Sheng who told you

9
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,919
How do they know how to distinguish medicinal materials

10
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
What did I bring you here for

11
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,399
Don't help yet

12
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,240
Yes

13
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,119
If it arrives in Beijing in September,

14
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,759
Maybe it's sun-dried

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Sun-drying

16
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:36,960
This

17
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,639
This is locked

18
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,240
It should be this thing

19
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,320
Help people over

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,080
Yes

21
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,080
Thank you, Your Highness

22
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,399
Royal Guards are really Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon

23
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,160
Stay another half an hour before leaving

24
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,039
Your Royal Highness Your Royal Highness

25
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,800
The humble position is wrong

26
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,520
The humble position is wrong

27
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
I followed you to protect your highness

28
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,080
Take away

29
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,160
Your Highness

30
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,559
Your Highness, come back

31
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:06,360
Your Highness

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,520
No

33
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,279
Is this a save or not

34
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,720
What are you two looking at

35
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,080
Come and help me

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,199
Wait for half an hour

37
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,160
Sure

38
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,399
Queen

39
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:28,000
Male and female servants. See Synonyms at Emperor

40
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,160
Deeper exposure

41
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,359
In poor health

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,559
Why do you have to see me

43
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,160
Ask Your Majesty's permission

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
Zhunsheng Taiyi

45
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,160
Continue to diagnose male and female servants and concubines

46
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,679
He gave the Queen a prescription before

47
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,359
Almost lead to human life

48
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,559
Fortunately, Long Si is safe

49
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,160
I'll keep him alive

50
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,720
It's already mercy

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,839
How could the Queen believe him

52
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,760
Male and female servants believe in Sheng Taiyi

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,359
Dr. Sheng did not deceive your majesty either

54
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,320
Is it pregnancy or illness

55
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Don't male and female servants understand themselves

56
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,359
Ask Your Majesty's permission

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,359
Dr. Sheng continued to treat me

58
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,040
Empress Empress

59
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,880
Dai Yuan sentenced him to be proficient in women's prescription

60
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,600
How can a mere happy pulse be consulted wrong

61
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,600
If you trust that quack

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,040
In case you hurt Long Si

63
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,040
Then who can afford to eat sin

64
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,720
There is no Long Si, Your Majesty

65
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,679
This matter is of great importance

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,079
Nature should not be neglected

67
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,119
Empress Empress

68
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,239
You go back to peace of mind first

69
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,760
How about Xuan Tai Yi asking for peace pulse for you again

70
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Peace

71
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,519
Within three days

72
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,799
I will give up my breath here

73
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
Where is peace

74
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Queen

75
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,920
Queen

76
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,559
Get up

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,160
It is a great good thing to meet happiness

78
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,320
How can you be full of nonsense

79
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,640
Father

80
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,440
The Empress is restless

81
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,079
Will say ominous words

82
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,239
I also ask my father to forgive me

83
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,440
Help your mother back to the palace

84
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,880
Your Majesty

85
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,600
I married into the royal family at the age of fifteen

86
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,399
Serve Your Majesty for more than 20 years

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,359
Give birth to three sons and one daughter

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't ask for anything else

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,720
Just ask your majesty

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Look at me

91
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,839
In order to serve you, I dedicated my life to serve you

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Allow me to be willful once

93
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,079
Just for once

94
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
I want to see Dr. Sheng

95
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
I want to live

96
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,839
Ask Your Majesty for mercy

97
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,920
I ordered Tai Hospital to consult for you

98
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,839
Isn't it saving your life

99
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,119
Every woman in the world must have children

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,279
I've never seen you so crazy

101
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,320
Queen

102
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:45,160
You had a baby

103
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,519
Can you tolerate a quack misdiagnosis

104
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,359
Let's lose one

105
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,200
A hard-won child

106
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,440
All consequences

107
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,760
I am willing to bear it with all my strength

108
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,679
Ask your majesty for help

109
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,799
Empress is the master of the six palaces

110
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,920
Mother instrument world

111
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,440
How can you say such a bizarre thing

112
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,720
Give birth to children for the royal family

113
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,799
It is the primary responsibility of the harem concubines

114
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,239
If I change my body,

115
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,839
My body is willing to give my life to save the dragon tire

116
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,600
How can an empress because

117
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,840
Can't stand some pain, then

118
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,119
Your Majesty

119
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,239
Cold moonlit night

120
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,559
You can no longer tolerate the Empress

121
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,679
Such a gaffe

122
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,640
If you really hurt Long Si,

123
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,239
Then what should I do

124
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,760
Help the Queen to return to Kunning Palace

125
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,200
Re-pass the decree

126
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,080
Summon all doctors to consult

127
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:05,880
Your Majesty

128
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,200
Your Majesty

129
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,359
Ask Your Majesty for mercy

130
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,520
I'm in pain

131
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,080
Ask Your Majesty to help me

132
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,159
Your Majesty

133
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:20,559
Your Majesty

134
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,039
Go ahead

135
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,919
Your Majesty

136
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,799
This hour

137
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,799
Go quickly

138
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,239
Yes

139
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,719
Queen

140
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,200
Come

141
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,760
Male and female servants and concubines gaffe today

142
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,400
Ask Your Majesty for forgiveness

143
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
Male and female servants and concubines retire

144
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,440
Before the Imperial Examinee

145
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,719
Always praise the queen for being deferential and wise

146
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:00,080
I also take her as my wife everywhere

147
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,280
How did the Queen become today

148
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,840
Like another person

149
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
So

150
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,400
Be so arbitrary

151
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,280
So

152
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,760
Irresponsible

153
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,960
Your Majesty

154
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Your Majesty

155
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,440
Wu Cairen

156
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,200
The empress has no guests today

157
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,280
Please go back

158
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
I'm not going in there to bother

159
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,159
I'll be right here

160
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
When the Empress gets better,

161
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I'll go in and say hello again

162
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,239
Come on in with me

163
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,440
You go down first

164
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,039
Your Highness

165
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,359
What's in that sack

166
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,359
It still moves

167
00:12:59,359 --> 00:12:59,880
Go back

168
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,119
Go back now

169
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,159
I'm not a doctor

170
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,039
How much it gets in the way here

171
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
Then you just let Mei Nvguan

172
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,599
No matter how persuaded, he refused to leave

173
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,119
Don't let your highness see it with his own eyes

174
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:09,840
I serve here

175
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,719
How can I get there

176
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,719
So that the Crown Princess can specialize in beauty

177
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,599
So now is the critical moment

178
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,599
You can't leave even more

179
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,080
In this deep palace

180
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,799
Pampering is indispensable, but it is also indispensable

181
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,440
No more, no less than me is enough

182
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,400
Let's go

183
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:30,479
Mother

184
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,159
Your Highness

185
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,359
Mother

186
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,440
Zhan Yong Zhan Zhao and Jiaxing

187
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,679
Crying to see you

188
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,159
They're worried about you

189
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,359
But I've had them sent back first

190
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,719
When you feel better,

191
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,239
Let them come and greet you again

192
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,000
Good

193
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:52,159
Mother

194
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,280
This time I brought Sheng Yin

195
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Take your pulse personally

196
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,960
His Royal Highness the Prince

197
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,719
Your Majesty has made a decree

198
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,280
Sheng Yin is not allowed to enter the palace again

199
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:02,719
Your Highness

200
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,440
It's against the rules

201
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,159
It's the rules that matter

202
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,280
Or is mother's life important

203
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,440
Sheng Yin

204
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,400
Yes

205
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:13,559
I

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,559
How

207
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,280
Your Highness

208
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,320
Fortunately, you made a quick decision

209
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,719
If in another three days

210
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,280
Hua Tuo can't be cured again

211
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,479
Sheng Tai Yi

212
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,880
The empress's illness is really so serious

213
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,960
The empress's pulse is heavy and tight

214
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,840
Lackluster

215
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,880
Neither slippery pulse nor pregnancy

216
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,080
But the meridians are blocked

217
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,000
Poor blood gas

218
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,440
Dangyi Taoren Chengqi Decoction

219
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,919
Hedidang Decoction promotes blood circulation and removes blood stasis

220
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,080
However

221
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,760
They have been taking medicine to prevent miscarriage and nourish their spirits

222
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,080
Warming meridians to stop bleeding

223
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:08,440
The more nature makes up, the more serious the illness is

224
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,919
Amenorrhea for 4 months

225
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,239
And abdominal pain

226
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,840
It's not pregnancy. What is it

227
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,200
As for the slippery pulse, it is flickering

228
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,200
That's the empress who is weak

229
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,520
Happy pulse just doesn't show

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,640
Your Highness

231
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,239
Taoren Chengqi Decoction has peach kernel and rhubarb

232
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,400
There are leeches and flies in Didang soup

233
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,479
Both prescriptions are blood stasis-removing drugs

234
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,000
Pregnant women taboo

235
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,359
Sheng Yin

236
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,960
You made a name for yourself

237
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
Damage the life of dragon fetus

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,239
This is a capital crime

239
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,640
His Royal Highness the Prince

240
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,239
Never listen to what quacks say

241
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,719
He went down with this dose of medicine

242
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,679
Don't say dragon tire

243
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,880
Phoenix body is also at stake

244
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,880
Your Highness

245
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,359
Previous diagnosis of handmaiden

246
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,400
It is indeed a slippery pulse

247
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,239
Please think twice, Your Highness

248
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,320
Everyone talks about gold

249
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,039
Accumulation and destruction of bones

250
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,599
After all, there are too many mediocre people in the world

251
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,919
Your Highness

252
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,679
I don't need to say much

253
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,760
I hope your highness will decide

254
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,599
Your Highness

255
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,000
Imperial doctors can prescribe medicines to patients

256
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,280
But you can't make decisions for patients

257
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,400
Mother

258
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
You have told me since you were a child

259
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,599
Be decisive in your life

260
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,280
Hesitation is bad for great things

261
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,479
So my son's way of dealing with people

262
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,280
They are all like mothers

263
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Even if you go the wrong way

264
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,400
Overcome difficulties and thorns

265
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,640
We must also go out of a bloody road

266
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
But now it's a matter of life

267
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,719
It is up to the mother to decide for herself

268
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,640
If you think Sheng Yin is right

269
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,760
Your son supports you

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,640
Your Highness

271
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,359
In case the emperor blames

272
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,719
My son is watching outside

273
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,000
No one will bother

274
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,039
You can rest assured

275
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,200
My son has always been with you

276
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,079
Please Sheng Yin

277
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Intake medicine

278
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,119
Yes

279
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,079
Your Majesty

280
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,319
You have to make decisions

281
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,599
What's going on

282
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,439
Your Majesty

283
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,079
You must stop the crown prince

284
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,000
He insisted that Sheng Yin heal the empress

285
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,000
I am afraid

286
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,319
I'm afraid this time Long Si really can't keep it

287
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,000
Arrogance

288
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,680
Your Majesty

289
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,079
Qikai empress just took the medicine

290
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,040
Your Majesty

291
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,959
Zhu Zhanji

292
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,680
Where is that quack

293
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,839
Your Majesty is here

294
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,599
Dr. Sheng, this is

295
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,199
Back to the Imperial Concubine Empress

296
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,079
I have made a written pledge to fulfill a military order before your highness

297
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:40,839
If you can't cure the empress,

298
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,280
I am willing to die

299
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,400
Sheng Yin you

300
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,959
You, you made a big mistake

301
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,880
Wearing a court sentence

302
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,599
Do you dare to follow my oath in public

303
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,400
You

304
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,439
If you can't cure the empress within ten days,

305
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,319
I'll take the head on your neck

306
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,040
Your Majesty

307
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,199
Two digits

308
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,239
Can dare

309
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,479
Your Majesty

310
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,560
Imperial doctors rely on medical skills to diagnose diseases

311
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
Not ignorance and fearlessness

312
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,920
Threatened with a knife and axe rashly

313
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,400
Imperial doctor is frightened

314
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,760
How to diagnose and treat with peace of mind

315
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,160
Sheng Yin

316
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,000
Don't speak wildly

317
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,719
If you hurt Long Si,

318
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,280
How can I get compensation for taking your head

319
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,359
Zhu Zhanji

320
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,400
Is this one of your tricks

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,439
Teach them

322
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,560
Father

323
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,319
Please respect the mother's decision

324
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,119
I don't respect your mother

325
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,800
If I don't respect her,

326
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,760
How can you call a doctor for consultation

327
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,800
Why did you come to visit in the middle of the night

328
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,040
Zhu Zhanji

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,880
Do you know that

330
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,439
Maybe because of one of your mistakes

331
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
It will ruin your mother's life

332
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,920
And the unborn child

333
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,280
You, you laugh

334
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,319
Smile, smile, smile, smile

335
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,800
Father

336
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,680
When you were the East Palace,

337
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,560
Do not hesitate to offend Grandpa Huang, but also stick to his heart

338
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,520
Brave admonition

339
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,319
As your wife

340
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,719
Mother is always by your side

341
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,319
Love is undiminished

342
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,640
Did she ever ask you about the consequences of doing so

343
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,920
Has she ever had a trace of fear and retreat

344
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,920
She never

345
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,439
What do you do

346
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
As long as you want to do it, she won't ask

347
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,040
I resolutely supported it

348
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,479
But if it were you

349
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,040
Why don't you trust her once

350
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,119
If you can't cure the queen

351
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,719
I don't want your head

352
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm going to destroy your door

353
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:48,719
Your Majesty

354
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,680
After the empress took the medicine,

355
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,000
Sure enough, there were a lot of blood stasis

356
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,479
The spirit is also good

357
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,119
Purple Azolla

358
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,520
I'll do it

359
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,319
You worked here all night last night

360
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,359
Only when cooking

361
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,199
My heart is calm

362
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,760
Last night

363
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,359
Empress Empress used blood medicine

364
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,079
Except for the stasis

365
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,000
Afraid of deficiency of qi and blood

366
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,680
Today, it is advisable to use medicated diet for invigorating qi and benefiting blood

367
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
I want to prepare in advance

368
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,599
You do the work alone

369
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,280
All the credit was divided by others

370
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,160
With what

371
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,839
The more you practice, the better your skills

372
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
Until no one can replace it

373
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,319
Is unique

374
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,400
Losses are blessings

375
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,479
It's not all deceptive

376
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,599
Row

377
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,280
To please the Empress

378
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,040
Is to please the crown prince

379
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Purple Azolla

380
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,719
There is something hidden in my heart all the time

381
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,439
It's about my past

382
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,160
I want to tell you today

383
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,560
Yao Ziliao

384
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
Please treat the empress to dinner

385
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,479
This longan medlar pigeon egg soup

386
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,520
Supplementing Qi, enriching blood, nourishing yin and moistening lung

387
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:52,920
It should be taken first

388
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,880
Are these bergamot petals on it

389
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,680
Back to the empress's words

390
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:33,119
This meal is called Chicken with Bergamot

391
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,880
There is a peculiar taste in the entrance

392
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,680
Like fermented bean curd

393
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,680
No

394
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,560
Lingering on the tip of the tongue

395
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,319
It smells like wine again

396
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Back to the empress

397
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,040
This recipe contains

398
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
Tofu milk and glutinous rice wine

399
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,640
Glutinous rice wine warms the middle and benefits qi

400
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,119
It was specially selected by the handmaiden for you

401
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,680
You have a heart

402
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:11,880
Empress

403
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,479
You slow down

404
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,000
Empress

405
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,280
You are recovering from your illness

406
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,680
Don't eat too much

407
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,479
Crispy skin and juicy inside

408
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,319
It tastes really good

409
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,839
It's a pity

410
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
It has been many, many years

411
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't smell this smell anymore

412
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,400
Queen Zhang is a native of Yongcheng

413
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,560
I like to use hot soup with fried dumplings for breakfast

414
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,319
You are proficient in famous dishes from all over the world

415
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,239
How can you not even know this thing

416
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,640
It's just some street snacks

417
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,359
How can you offer such crude food

418
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,359
There are more than 20 kinds of ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines in the soup

419
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,479
Adjust according to the changes of the four seasons

420
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,880
The Queen asked about the recipe

421
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
You are speechless

422
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,239
In this way

423
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,239
The empress knows that there is another person who makes the meal

424
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,479
What a waste of the opportunity I gave you

425
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,400
Empress

426
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,599
Your phoenix body is recovering

427
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
Otherwise, we'll do it after a while

428
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,040
Do you know the origin of this spinning wheel

429
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,479
Handmaiden heard

430
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,800
This was given to you by Queen Renxiao in those days

431
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:16,640
Yeah

432
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,479
When my mother gave it to me, she said

433
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,959
One husband does not plow

434
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,079
Or suffer from hunger

435
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,479
A woman does not knit

436
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,680
Or suffer from cold

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Male ploughing and female weaving

438
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,760
The husband sings along with the woman

439
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,000
It is the best in the world

440
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,640
Yes

441
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:49,880
Empress

442
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,119
Empress

443
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,079
What a pity that the spinning wheel has been smashed

444
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,359
Empress sent it to Shangshi Bureau

445
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,719
When the firewood burns

446
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,199
Yes

447
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:10,520
Father

448
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,800
Why are you here

449
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,880
I heard that my father's dragon body is not safe

450
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,680
My son came to plead guilty

451
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:27,800
Father

452
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,880
Take the medicine first

453
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,000
Wei Chen came late

454
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,040
Please pardon the emperor

455
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:51,040
Guangzong County, Shunde Prefecture has a lot of rain this year

456
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,479
The local report is late

457
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,800
Life and life delayed the disaster relief

458
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,040
I have already made a decree

459
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,920
However, natural disasters

460
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,280
Be sure to open the warehouse for relief first

461
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,599
But in this way

462
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,239
There must be officials who are greedy for ink

463
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,520
Are you going to

464
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,040
Father

465
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,000
If you are worried about local officials

466
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,760
Take advantage of disaster relief to enrich oneself

467
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,680
You can send patrol according to the censor to visit

468
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,680
However, the empire went to check with great fanfare

469
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,760
As far as eyes and ears can see

470
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,479
It's just that others want to see it

471
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,199
At a young age

472
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,959
What do you know

473
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,280
Father

474
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,599
Now the Royal Guards are out of Beijing to get people

475
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,640
Arrests often occur without permission

476
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,040
It is conceivable

477
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,920
How arrogant are you on weekdays

478
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,920
If you order them to visit secretly again,

479
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,359
I'm afraid there will be more illegal things

480
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
When Grandpa Huang was here,

481
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,280
They will restrain themselves a little

482
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,359
Now

483
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,040
It's me

484
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,319
It's me

485
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,280
Let the Royal Guards act cheaply

486
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,359
Father

487
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,280
Out

488
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,640
Verbal collision between children and ministers

489
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,319
Please take care of the dragon body

490
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,319
If you mother and son hadn't joined hands to anger me

491
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,000
I am in good health

492
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,160
Why don't you go

493
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,640
My son retires

494
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,560
Inverse

495
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,719
I have read the paper you presented

496
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,439
It's fairly pertinent

497
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,319
But those things are worried by ministers of various ministries and hospitals

498
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,280
Don't worry about it

499
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,239
One mutilates Zhongliang

500
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:15,839
Butchers who kill countless people

501
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,400
I will learn from people who are full of reading to give advice to the emperor

502
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:22,040
What capital has water transportation to solve households' difficulties

503
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,000
Have nowhere to live

504
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,880
It's simply nonsense

505
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,400
I dare not talk loudly

506
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,599
People only need a few strokes

507
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,959
Talk to guests and friends at Lord Liu's banquet yesterday

508
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,040
Write it down one by one

509
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:36,400
Your head will be in danger tomorrow

510
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:39,160
Don't stain my eyes with this pickling thing

511
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,359
This is

512
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,719
Your Majesty

513
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Recurrence of old disease

514
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,400
Dai Yuan ruled that the dragon body must be conditioned according to the prescription

515
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,199
You can't be vegetarian anymore

516
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:31,719
Help quickly

517
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:32,319
Move in

518
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,439
Move things in together

519
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,599
Come here

520
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,800
Come

521
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:41,800
Be careful

522
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,599
You bring it

523
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,359
This is what the Imperial Concubine of Yongning Palace wants

524
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,119
You can't take it

525
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,479
Do you have eyes

526
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,920
Dare to occupy the Queen's master's things

527
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,760
You let go

528
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,839
Give it to me

529
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,839
Give it to me

530
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,880
Don't take mine

531
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,479
What are you doing noisily

532
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,839
Sister Yu Lu

533
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,680
It is clearly the black wolfberry set by Kunning Palace

534
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
She insisted that the imperial concubine should use it

535
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
I have to take it all away

536
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,479
We made a reservation three days ago

537
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,040
It's just that it doesn't match for a while

538
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,520
There must be a first come, first served

539
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,040
Let go

540
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,359
You all took it

541
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,719
What am I going to tell you

542
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,359
Stop

543
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:27,920
Jade chowder

544
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,520
It doesn't matter if the little palace maidservants do something wrong and scold them

545
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,839
Who gave you permission to do it

546
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,839
Again

547
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,359
The imperial concubine prepared black wolfberry

548
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,160
It is to cure the emperor's heart disease

549
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
Who can go over the emperor

550
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:39,839
Give me Chinese wolfberry

551
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,239
I

552
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,239
Give it to me

553
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:44,839
Give it to me

554
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,359
This is decided by the Imperial Concubine

555
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,800
Mine

556
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,160
Sure

557
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,160
This black wolfberry was born in the mountains

558
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,040
Hard to come by

559
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,880
You dare to knock over such precious medicinal materials

560
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,800
Clearly you let go first

561
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,239
Why are you framing me? You knocked it over

562
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,000
You

563
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,760
Look at the canon meal

564
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,520
Parsley can make a big disaster

565
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,119
I

566
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,160
Something heartless

567
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,399
Dare to abuse anything

568
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,879
Everyone misses. Say it well

569
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,199
So loud and noisy

570
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,560
What did it look like when outsiders heard it

571
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,320
Pack up quickly

572
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,760
I have no one behind me

573
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,439
Naturally, I dare not be presumptuous

574
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,199
Which is better than the upper sister

575
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,399
I am rushing to settle vegetables with others

576
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,520
It's about to climb the high branch

577
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,560
You

578
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,760
Be cruel to others

579
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,560
His face has changed

580
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,679
This is a painful foot, isn't it

581
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,120
I let you fall

582
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,560
Xuelu, you take it

583
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,600
Let go

584
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,560
Don't take it

585
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,399
Can't take it

586
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,520
I really can't take it

587
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,040
Don't spoil it

588
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,239
You can't take it

589
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,320
Stop fighting

590
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,040
Recipe canon meal

591
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,840
Recipe canon meal

592
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,719
Recipe canon meal

593
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,239
Don't take it

594
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,760
You

595
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,080
Come here

596
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,520
Stay

597
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,280
Stop

598
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,439
Let you fight

599
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:18,719
Purple Azolla

600
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,719
Yin Ziping

601
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,439
Don't take it

602
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,199
Stop fighting

603
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,040
Stop fighting

604
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,800
Don't take it

605
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,760
Stop fighting

606
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:27,439
Purple Azolla

607
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,520
Purple Azolla

608
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,360
Stop

609
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,080
Here comes Lord Shang Shi

610
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,040
Don't stop it all yet

611
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,840
Kneel down, kneel down

612
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,919
Kneel for an hour

613
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,159
Meditate on the past

614
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,879
I

615
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:52,479
Kneel well

616
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,439
Pretend

617
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,199
What about you

618
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,360
What to fight

619
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,479
The emperor's golden words

620
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,239
Reinstated Meng's official position

621
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,159
I can't refute your majesty's wishes either

622
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,959
The Love of Man

623
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,040
Seek profit

624
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:28,399
If you want to be in charge of the food bureau,

625
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,760
Everyone must be convinced

626
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:31,800
Otherwise

627
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,439
Even if I do,

628
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,560
It's hard for you to convince the public

629
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:36,800
Empress

630
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,479
Handmaiden has confidence

631
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,679
On Qualifications

632
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,600
Monteggia is far above you

633
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I want you to compete fairly

634
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,760
Empress Empress

635
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:55,040
Go down

636
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,360
Empress Empress

637
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,919
Your Majesty has just issued a decree

638
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,080
Guo Guifei's brother Guo Ming attacked the Marquis of Wuding

639
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,840
Grandmother Yan surpassed the system and was named the Duchess of Yingguo

640
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,840
Mother Xu was named Mrs. Tai

641
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,919
And

642
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,159
The first emperor nearly served Huang Yan and had an affair with foreign ministers

643
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,639
After Huang Yanyan took over,

644
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,760
All the assets under his name also belong to Wudinghou

645
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,439
Everything is planned before moving

646
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,040
Be too impatient

647
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:33,320
Can't achieve great things

648
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,360
Yes

649
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,399
Granddaughter Guo Duansushu's grandmother's knee

650
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,639
Self-serving and merciful

651
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,520
Over summer and over autumn

652
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,439
Recent news of grandmother's disharmony in daily life

653
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,679
The special envoy will lead the imperial doctor

654
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,560
Go and say hello

655
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:06,879
Jade Beijing

656
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,399
You must send this letter

657
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,000
Hand it over to grandmother

658
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:12,520
And bring me a few words

659
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,639
Kishito Tomoki

660
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:16,840
So help the top

661
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,159
Courtesy, frugality and modesty

662
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,639
So self-control

663
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,679
Please ask your grandmother to give birth to brothers, sons and nephews in the discipline clan

664
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,560
To protect our Guo family

665
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,760
Long-term peace and wealth

666
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,040
Empress

667
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,399
Now your own brother has attacked the marquis

668
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,879
It can be seen that your majesty treats Guo's family with great favor

669
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,560
Even the Queen's maiden family is far less than that

670
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,879
You should be happy

671
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,760
Why are you still so worried

672
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,280
I'm glad

673
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,919
Someone will be unhappy

674
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,879
If you can't be prepared for danger in times of peace

675
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,280
Disaster

676
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,719
Not far away

677
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,199
Yes

678
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,040
Wait a minute

679
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,120
Here

680
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,000
It is a thousand-year-old wild ginseng and a thousand-year-old Ganoderma lucidum

681
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,159
This is the medicine from Tai Hospital

682
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,879
Old people are getting old

683
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,719
Weak and sick, susceptible to wind and cold

684
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,399
This is specially given by the imperial doctor

685
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,520
You take it with you

686
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,840
You should be careful to observe the maid around the old grandmother

687
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,399
In case there is poor care,

688
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,800
Get rid of it at once

689
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,760
Yes

690
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,520
Be careful on the road

691
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:01,760
Let's go

692
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:25,800
Your Highness is back

693
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:27,639
Why are you here

694
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,879
Didn't your highness love this solitude best before

695
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,679
Just because the strings are broken

696
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,600
What a pity

697
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,280
Now I have found it

698
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,000
Silk strings matching the original piano

699
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,639
Replaced it for your highness

700
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,040
You listen

701
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,080
The voice is as clear and mellow as before

702
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,399
Why don't I play a song for your highness

703
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,600
Relieve your highness's boredom

704
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:51,560
No need

705
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Someone will sort it out

706
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,360
If your highness is bored,

707
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,080
Can you tell my body

708
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:23,800
Although I am stupid,

709
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,959
May not be able to solve your highness's worries

710
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,159
But if you speak your heart,

711
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,760
It won't be left untold

712
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,879
Your Highness, stay with the piano

713
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,520
Thank you for your trouble

714
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:36,600
If nothing else

715
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,040
I'll see you another day

716
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,479
Your Highness

717
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,719
What else is there

718
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,320
A rudimentary study

719
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,679
It is not a place to live for a long time

720
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,120
The mother is afraid that people will lose their care again

721
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,080
Sent me to consult with your highness

722
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,360
Let's go back to live

723
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,320
People come and go in the palace every day

724
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,000
It's very noisy

725
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,520
Compared with here

726
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:05,719
Lack of elegance

727
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,080
I'll live here

728
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,439
Where is Your Highness

729
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:10,280
Where should I be, too

730
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,159
Since you won't move away

731
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,360
Then from tomorrow

732
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,000
I often come to keep company

733
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,280
When your highness is busy

734
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,679
I will grind ink and pour tea

735
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,120
If you are free

736
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,679
Talk with you again to relieve boredom

737
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:22,760
How well

738
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,120
I told you so long ago

739
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,879
You don't have to serve day and night

740
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,479
When the former mother and queen were the Eastern Palace concubines,

741
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,199
Every father's diet and daily life

742
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,679
Will take care of it personally

743
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,120
This is the duty of being a wife

744
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,320
Once upon a time, because your highness was tolerant,

745
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,639
I am more slack

746
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,399
Now it is a serious mend

747
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,040
If I say no, I don't have to

748
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,120
Yuan Qi

749
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,239
Send the Crown Princess back

750
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,280
Yes

751
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,600
Crown Princess

752
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:48,520
You please

753
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:52,719
I'll come back tomorrow

754
00:42:58,959 --> 00:42:59,719
You don't have to send it

755
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Serve your highness well

756
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:12,320
Your Highness

757
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:13,919
Do you see

758
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,919
How do I feel

759
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:19,840
Today, this crown princess

760
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,280
It's different from usual

761
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,639
What time is it

762
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:26,919
Why hasn't the meal been delivered yet

763
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,120
Sent it, sent it

764
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
It was already delivered

765
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,120
Miss Yao has put the food box

766
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,040
It's out there

767
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,800
Weren't the Crown Princess here just now

768
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:40,040
