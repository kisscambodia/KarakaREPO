1
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,721
Father

2
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,520
Out

3
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,161
Father

4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,320
Out

5
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:29,600
Dad

6
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,040
What are you laughing at

7
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,001
Grandpa Huang doesn't have to waste time

8
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,161
You asked Lord Xia to accompany me to visit the countryside

9
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,920
Understand the sufferings of the people

10
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,640
Lord Xia always forced me to eat with millet

11
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,640
I have a grudge in my heart for a long time

12
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,640
So I sent someone to visit secretly

13
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,920
Trying to find evidence of his guilt

14
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:15,241
But the people I sent came back and told me

15
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,480
There are only cloth and earthen wares in Lord Xia's house

16
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,120
Nothing else

17
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:26,801
In fact, it is only a trivial matter for Xia Yuanji to kill or

18
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:55,200
That

19
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:57,801
What is a big deal

20
00:03:59,321 --> 00:03:59,961
Grandpa Emperor

21
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,280
You have been ill twice

22
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Long live your grandchildren

23
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:09,241
Your grandson will go for you on this northern expedition

24
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:10,161
Good or not

25
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,400
Life is 100 years old

26
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,081
There are many things in the world

27
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,601
But they are all gone

28
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:22,601
There is no smell

29
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,321
Yan Hui-san

30
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,120
Fame has been passed down for generations

31
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,361
I want to create meritorious service for all ages

32
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,321
Why a centenarian

33
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,920
But you can't go

34
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,480
Grandpa Emperor

35
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,120
I can rest assured that the North Expedition

36
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,040
Because you stayed in Beijing

37
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:55,721
I can't risk Daming's future

38
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,201
Arutai

39
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,321
Invade every year

40
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,360
People are suffering

41
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:20,400
I often think about it

42
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:22,601
The cone center is piercing

43
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,080
They scolded me for being overjoyed

44
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,680
By him

45
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:29,080
Scold me for being militaristic

46
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,161
Also by him

47
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,881
I

48
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,960
Even if there is a eternal stigma behind him,

49
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Never allow an inch of Daming land to be trampled on

50
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:45,481
Not to mention the displacement of Daming people

51
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:51,481
Children

52
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:56,201
Your father has read a lot of books of sages

53
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Be fooled by a bunch of book beetles

54
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:02,321
Since you think

55
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:05,080
That old thing in the household department is still useful

56
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll leave it to you

57
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,761
Grandpa Emperor

58
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:17,041
You have been on the throne for more than 20 years

59
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:18,161
All nations come to Korea

60
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:20,001
Try to ask the past dynasties

61
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,560
With the respect of the son of heaven

62
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,161
Personal expedition to the desert

63
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,321
How many people are there

64
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,240
Your mind and vision

65
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,601
Is it known to the finches under the porch

66
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:32,240
There are few eagles in the world

67
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,960
How many short-sighted finches are there

68
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:45,161
Wear thousands of clothes

69
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,481
Is not to wear flattery

70
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,161
What other nice words are there

71
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,400
You

72
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,441
Have you finished what I asked you to do

73
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,240
Don't do it yet

74
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,001
Go ahead

75
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,921
Zhan Ji

76
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,960
When Grandpa Huang wins, he will return to the DPRK

77
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,800
We went hunting together

78
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:15,560
Yes

79
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:25,601
Retirement of grandchildren

80
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,520
April of the 22nd year of Yongle

81
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,161
Zhu Di led hundreds of thousands of troops

82
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,761
The fifth personal expedition to Mobei

83
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,441
Order the Crown Prince to supervise the country

84
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,280
June

85
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,601
Daming Army Arrives at Dalan Namur River

86
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
Arutai fled when he heard the wind

87
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:05,680
The Ming army searched the valley for 300 miles and got nothing

88
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,001
The army is short of food and grass

89
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,840
Zhu Di ordered the squad

90
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:13,161
July

91
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,560
Holy driving to Yumuchuan

92
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,240
Zhu Zhanji returned to Beijing by secret order to raise grain and grass

93
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:21,721
Soon

94
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:25,120
A piece of news that can shake the world

95
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,120
Follow

96
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:41,041
Yao palm meal

97
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,601
Don't you have anything to say to me

98
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:50,921
Handmaiden fear

99
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,761
You don't have the slightest look of fear on your face

100
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,321
I return to Beijing in March

101
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,761
I met Grandpa Huang and left in a hurry

102
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,441
I returned to Beijing in May and stayed for three days

103
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I deliberately didn't summon you

104
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,001
I just wanted to see if you'd come to me

105
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,560
I haven't seen you for so long

106
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,881
There is nothing to say

107
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,001
Your Highness

108
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,800
This braised rabbit meat

109
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,321
It was specially cooked for your highness by the Shang Food Bureau

110
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,600
Hu Shangshi made it by himself

111
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:24,761
I can't believe you put me

112
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:25,920
The rabbit I brought back to you all the way

113
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,600
Be cooked

114
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,401
Your Highness, this

115
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,521
I'll write to you

116
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,401
You didn't reply to me until a month late

117
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,720
Let someone bring you a gift

118
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,761
How dare you make it braised in soy sauce

119
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:46,920
With a dedicated female official like you

120
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,240
It's really moving

121
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,800
What are you laughing at

122
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:53,881
Your Highness

123
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,321
This is the other one

124
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,160
The one my highness gave me has long since run away

125
00:09:58,881 --> 00:09:59,920
How can you stay until now

126
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,201
I haven't been back to Beijing for so long

127
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,040
You don't miss me at all

128
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,961
Your Highness

129
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:10,761
I

130
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,720
Your Highness

131
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:22,441
Say

132
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,321
Your Highness

133
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,120
Your Highness

134
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:38,560
Stay in Shangshi Bureau

135
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:39,641
Don't go anywhere

136
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,360
Your Highness, Father

137
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,761
You left too suddenly

138
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:58,560
My son is heartbroken

139
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,281
Your Highness, don't do this

140
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,881
Great grief hurts my body

141
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,641
You should take good care of yourself

142
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:04,761
Your Highness

143
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,001
Your Highness

144
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,001
Father

145
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:17,841
Where's the emperor and grandson

146
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,281
Back to the words of the Crown Princess

147
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,001
Yang Rong and Hai Shou's Secret Report to Beijing

148
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,240
As soon as Emperor Taisun learned the news,

149
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,841
I reported it to His Royal Highness the Prince

150
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:29,841
I immediately left Beijing to welcome the funeral

151
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,001
Once the ruling and opposition parties hear about it,

152
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,360
Everyone will be afraid

153
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,841
Send my orders

154
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:45,081
Blocking messages

155
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Waiting for the emperor's grandson to return to Beijing in Fengzi Palace

156
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Go to mourning again

157
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,641
Yes

158
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,281
Emperor

159
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,521
August of the 22nd year of Yongle

160
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:12,240
The Crown Prince sent Taisun Yingzi Palace to Kaiping

161
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,881
Military mourning

162
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,881
Be careful

163
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:23,761
Why don't you come down first? Come down

164
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:24,201
Hurry up

165
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:27,680
Grandpa Emperor

166
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:31,641
Clearly agreed to return from the expedition

167
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,201
You, my grandparents and grandchildren will go hunting in Nanhaizi

168
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,321
Now the old bow is still there

169
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,240
But where did your old man go

170
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,360
You have made a promise in your life

171
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,720
Never break a promise to others

172
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,160
But why only this time

173
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:02,401
And you lied to me

174
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:08,480
Why

175
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:11,961
Your Majesty's Register

176
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,800
Your Majesty

177
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,401
What

178
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:18,680
Your Majesty

179
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,841
Taizu collapsed and died

180
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,281
Forty concubines in the harem

181
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,401
All body martyrdom and burial

182
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,401
According to the ancestral system set by Taizu

183
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,961
All the concubines in the harem

184
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:32,920
All must be buried underground

185
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,281
How many people

186
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:40,920
Sixteen people

187
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,961
All must be buried

188
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:46,281
Your Majesty

189
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,761
Wait a minute

190
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,201
Please tell the empress

191
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,441
Families of concubines who are buried

192
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,441
Give preferential treatment according to the old rules

193
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,641
Father and brother hereditary Royal Guards

194
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,920
Princess Zhuang has served the first emperor for a long time

195
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,120
It's better to send her on the road

196
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,040
Go ahead

197
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:20,560
Yes

198
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,441
You can't go in there

199
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:37,961
The queen has a life

200
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,841
Be especially kind to Empress Zhuang Fei

201
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,401
Besides

202
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
The concubines must eat enough before going on the road

203
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,401
Why bother Princess Zhuang, you two

204
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,680
Empress Zhuang Fei

205
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,401
This is the walnut cheese you mentioned many times before

206
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,600
You try it

207
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,321
Is it the same taste as before

208
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,800
Not the same

209
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,600
Walnut cheese made with my mother

210
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:35,961
Not the same

211
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,560
Help me

212
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,040
I beg you to help me again

213
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:08,600
Empress Zhuang Fei

214
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,441
You get up quickly

215
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,600
You have touched us many times before and remembered it in our hearts

216
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,961
But we are just small palace maidservants of the Food Bureau

217
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,081
Martyrdom is an ancestral system

218
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,521
How can we help

219
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,881
Deadline for human burial

220
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:22,641
It was after sunset today

221
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:25,321
You help me get out of the palace

222
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,600
Help me out of the palace

223
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,920
Empress Zhuang Fei

224
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,761
You

225
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:36,720
The Queen won't see us

226
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:38,841
I can't plead with her

227
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm not I'm not running away

228
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,360
I just want to meet my mother

229
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,080
She has no son

230
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,001
No one to rely on

231
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,600
I don't ask for anything else

232
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
I just need to see her once

233
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,440
Even if it is said that

234
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,320
Say the last farewell words

235
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
I'll just say goodbye and come back

236
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,521
I'm begging you to help me

237
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:03,561
I'm begging you to help me

238
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:04,840
Please, please

239
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,561
I'll just say one word and I'll be back

240
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:20,921
I

241
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:25,161
I just want to see my mother one last time

242
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,240
Even with such a little request,

243
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,360
Can't satisfy me

244
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,161
You want to leave the palace

245
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,440
Empress Zhuang Fei

246
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,041
There are only three people now

247
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,360
If you don't come back before sunset

248
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,240
The three of us will lose our lives

249
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:02,761
You have a way to get me out of the palace

250
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:06,521
That's great

251
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:07,320
I swear

252
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,240
I will definitely come back

253
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,161
I swear I'll be back

254
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:12,240
Well, before sunset

255
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:15,681
Yao Ziliao

256
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,600
Know I'm going to die

257
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:23,681
Use this kind of thing to perfunctory me

258
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:24,720
Fuck off

259
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Get out of here, all of them

260
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,200
Get out of here

261
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,080
Fuck off

262
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,840
Empress

263
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,521
Everybody out

264
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:31,921
What are you doing, Empress

265
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:33,480
Empress calms one's anger

266
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,240
Empress calms one's anger

267
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,001
Handmaiden will redo it and send it

268
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
It's Thursday today

269
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,720
There was supposed to be an inner city outside Xuanwu Gate

270
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,761
You can go out with a waist tag

271
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,960
But there has been a strike during the funeral

272
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,360
Entry and exit

273
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:08,360
Most of them are people who go to various prisons and bureaus to do business

274
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
Go all the way through the long street

275
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,161
Encounter patrol guards

276
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,600
Show them the waist tag

277
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,840
Just say

278
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,801
The number of sauces sent by the wine and vinegar noodle bureau is wrong

279
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,240
Hu Shangshi sent you to ask

280
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,440
Next

281
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:31,281
Waist tag

282
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,600
What are you doing

283
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:33,720
It's in line

284
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,521
It's clear that I came first

285
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,681
What's wrong with me standing in front

286
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:37,960
You are unreasonable.

287
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,600
Do you know what this place is

288
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:40,921
Wanton noise

289
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,080
Get out of here

290
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,960
Take away

291
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:44,561
Let's go

292
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:45,001
Go

293
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:45,840
It wasn't her first

294
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,360
Go

295
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:53,360
Out of Xuanwu Gate

296
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,840
The really sad one is at Bei'an Gate

297
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,521
How kind of a girl you are

298
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:04,921
A dying man

299
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:06,401
I really redone it and sent it

300
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,161
Is the dying man

301
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,240
Why bother with her

302
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:14,360
Be full

303
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:15,720
It's better to hit the road later

304
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:17,480
Go inside

305
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,041
Why

306
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:36,281
Yeah

307
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:38,521
Why

308
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,561
It used to be profitable for me to help her

309
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,881
But now she is going to be buried soon

310
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:47,521
Is a useless person

311
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:48,720
Why are you

312
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,401
To take such a big risk to help her

313
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:56,960
What are you looking at me for

314
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,240
Am I wrong

315
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,881
Clearly follow the steps said by Empress Zhuang Fei

316
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,521
To make walnut cheese

317
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,120
Why does it taste different

318
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:09,200
People are going to die

319
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,681
What to eat is different

320
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,921
Good

321
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,041
Even if you say so

322
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:17,200
She went out of Xuanwu Gate smoothly

323
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,480
But how can she get out of Bei'an Gate

324
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,161
I heard that the eighteen red shops there

325
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:24,521
Hundreds of guards

326
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
You can't escape with your wings

327
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:29,401
Zi Jin

328
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,600
We're going to get people back now

329
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,881
You can also atone for your merits

330
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:34,840
How is it

331
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:38,001
Zi Jin

332
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,801
Zi Jin

333
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:43,281
Is it these walnuts that are the problem

334
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,761
Yao Ziliao

335
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,001
And only you would believe her

336
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,881
If it were me,

337
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,080
Have a chance to escape

338
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,041
Why don't I run away at once

339
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:54,521
The empress will come back

340
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,281
She never broke her promise

341
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,401
In the face of the threat of death

342
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,881
Anyone will become selfish and cowardly

343
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,041
There is no exception

344
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,281
Clearly you don't have to come in to deliver food

345
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,200
Then why did you come

346
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,840
Not afraid of death

347
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,561
You will be afraid by yourself

348
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,840
Purple Azolla

349
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:18,720
Will come back

350
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:40,480
I knew it

351
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,720
Who will take the initiative to come back and die

352
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:44,240
Liar

353
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:47,521
Yao Ziliao

354
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
You fool

355
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:53,720
Go

356
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,881
Go quickly

357
00:23:58,681 --> 00:23:59,080
Hurry up

358
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,360
There is also Zhuang Fei, the master of Yongning Palace

359
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,440
Go quickly

360
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:09,681
Miss Yao

361
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:15,401
Palm lamp

362
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,600
They'll be here soon

363
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:23,960
Quickly

364
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,840
It's right ahead

365
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Don't delay the time.

366
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,641
Yes

367
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:30,360
You go

368
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,641
You go now

369
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:32,761
Purple Azolla

370
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,200
You don't have to worry about implicating other people in Yongning Palace

371
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,120
I stay

372
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:40,281
Why do you say that

373
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,960
I should have been a dead man

374
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:44,001
I will pay you my life this time

375
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,281
You and I will not owe each other in the future

376
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,240
What does this mean

377
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:53,521
The night our whole family died

378
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,161
I was the only one who escaped from life

379
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:58,281
You think

380
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:00,240
The man who opened the cricket can in those days

381
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,161
Is it really my brother

382
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,281
People who know you are kind now

383
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:21,840
What kind of monster is it?

384
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,600
You go quickly

385
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm not leaving

386
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,881
You go

387
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:24,281
Purple Azolla

388
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:28,041
Open the door

389
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:29,360
Yes

390
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,881
Why is it plugged in

391
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,960
Knock

392
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:35,840
Yes

393
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,080
Open the door. Open the door

394
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,881
Open the door quickly

395
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,720
Open the door

396
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:42,200
Open the door

397
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,960
Crash open

398
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,480
Yes

399
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,320
I will serve your majesty

400
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,641
Dress up yourself

401
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,600
Who allowed you to be so presumptuous

402
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:18,440
No rules

403
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:21,840
Empress Zhuang Fei

404
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:23,161
Please

405
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,960
I thought Princess Zhuang was gone forever

406
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:43,440
But

407
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:45,801
How on earth did she get out of Bei'an Gate

408
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:49,561
Zi Jin

409
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:53,401
Zi Jin

410
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:58,041
Zi Jin

411
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,480
Zi Jin

412
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,120
What's the matter

413
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,761
Don't you like hemp fiber cake best

414
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:07,881
So delicious hemp fiber cake

415
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,001
Eat it at ordinary times

416
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:13,801
I can't help swallowing the hemp fiber cake with my tongue

417
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:15,720
I don't know why

418
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,521
It doesn't taste good at all now

419
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,960
This is when I made walnut cheese for Zhuang Fei

420
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,921
The rest of the ingredients

421
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,080
What's the matter

422
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:55,360
Where do these come from

423
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,041
Liaoxian Mianwalnut and Lingbao red jujube

424
00:28:58,401 --> 00:28:59,480
They are all excellent tributes

425
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,681
Here it is

426
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,200
This is the ingredients sent by the pharmacy department to make medicated diet

427
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:20,921
Although the nuts are big,

428
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:23,720
But it is far less sweet and crisp than cotton walnuts

429
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:24,960
It's still a little astringent

430
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,761
What is this for

431
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,080
It's not too late to make walnut cheese now

432
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,641
It's for Princess Zhuang

433
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:32,761
The number of ingredients sent recently has become more perfunctory

434
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:34,921
Fragrant rice and dried fruit antlers

435
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:36,521
There are problems with the number of seafood in the East China Sea

436
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,521
Wang Sishan resolutely refused to accept it

437
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,200
If it weren't for the handmaiden perfunctory

438
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,320
I am afraid I have already asked Guanglu Temple

439
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,881
I see

440
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,641
I'm afraid Wang Sishan is opinionated

441
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,801
In case she knows

442
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,041
I'll take care of it

443
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:55,720
Yes

444
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,440
Where did Zi Jin go today

445
00:30:58,641 --> 00:30:59,401
You check it out

446
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,320
I'll go by myself

447
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:02,200
Empress

448
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,161
Empress

449
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:06,681
Zi Jin

450
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:09,200
Don't be rude

451
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:11,960
Zi Jin

452
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:18,840
Empress Zhuang Fei

453
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,320
The handmaiden made you walnut cheese

454
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:23,801
You try it

455
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:27,881
Wang Si's meal

456
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,960
I just want to do my last thing

457
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:44,881
Zi Jin

458
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,440
Purple Azolla

459
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:48,281
Quickly

460
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,681
Right

461
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,641
When I was a child in Jiangnan

462
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:33,801
This is the taste of walnut cheese made by my mother

463
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,161
Empress

464
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,600
No matter how excellent the ingredients are,

465
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,120
The most beautiful taste in the world

466
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:49,041
It is the memory of my hometown

467
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:55,480
I'm sorry

468
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,161
I lied to you

469
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,801
I walked out of the Forbidden City

470
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,320
I didn't want to come back

471
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,320
But the bearers scared away

472
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,921
I can only carry my mother behind my back

473
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,840
Knocking on the door from house to house

474
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,720
Can cling to our relatives in the past

475
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:19,401
No one dares to resist the decree

476
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,561
But my feet

477
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,161
It's not far away

478
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,681
Even if I give birth to wings,

479
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:31,480
I can't fly out of here

480
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:37,801
Empress should hit the road

481
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,841
My last moments in this world

482
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:53,400
It's warm

483
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:04,561
Empress

484
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:27,121
The Emperor arrives

485
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,801
Your Majesty is here

486
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,561
Did Your Majesty come specially to see him off

487
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,480
I am willing to die today

488
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,361
I implore Your Majesty to remember your promise

489
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:15,680
Take care of my mother for me

490
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,160
Don't let her be displaced

491
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:21,400
No branches to follow

492
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:29,880
Your Majesty

493
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,521
Ancestral system can not be violated

494
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:25,561
Zi Jin

495
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,160
Mother

496
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,480
I went

497
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:26,801
Empress

498
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,680
Empress

499
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:28,640
Empress

500
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,680
Empress, are you all right

501
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:36,680
Down

502
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,680
Now

503
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:58,761
Do you understand everything

504
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,361
Presumptuous

505
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:04,761
Concubines can only be buried without children

506
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:06,960
After the courtiers, they were saved from death according to the law

507
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:08,761
What's more

508
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,601
Your Majesty is now in good health

509
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,640
I just

510
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,480
I just can't bear it

511
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:20,321
I was born for Emperor Taizu in those days

512
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:22,841
There are also concubines who have given birth to children

513
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,041
Why don't you think about it

514
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,400
Who will decide your destiny in the end

515
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,121
You

516
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Empress

517
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,880
Your hands are shaking all the time

518
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,240
Send you back to the palace, handmaiden

519
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:26,801
Purple Azolla

520
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:28,521
Purple Azolla

521
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:31,240
Yin Ziping

522
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:38,920
Purple Azolla

523
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:39,801
Zi Jin

524
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,281
Quick, quick, quick

525
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:41,801
You come back

526
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,281
What are you doing

527
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,801
Don't you know how to get out of Bei'an Gate

528
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:49,041
Nowadays, the whole country holds mourning and crying sacrifices

529
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,081
We still have a chance

530
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,041
Go, go, go

531
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:52,081
You come here

532
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:53,960
You tell me

533
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,121
Why did you leave

534
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:57,801
Sacrificial burial

535
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,521
Only concubines were buried

536
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,041
We are the palace maidservants of the Shang Food Bureau

537
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,561
Then you promise me

538
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,361
Don't care about the emperor and grandson anymore

539
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,121
Let's not be concubines anymore

540
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:10,480
Be a good female official

541
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:11,400
Good or not

542
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,081
Purple Azolla

543
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:15,121
Ronghua Fugui Fresh Clothes and Gourmet Food

544
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:16,121
No matter how precious everything is,

545
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:17,920
They are insignificant in front of life

546
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:19,761
Look at today's situation

547
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:22,001
I'm afraid you will follow in the footsteps of Zhuang Fei

548
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,521
Rest assured

549
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:27,001
I won't

550
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:33,801
Become a concubine

551
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:35,281
If there are no children

552
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:36,640
Possible martyrdom

553
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,121
Become a female official

554
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:40,761
Row difference and step wrong

555
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,601
Worry about one's life

556
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:45,480
Walk out of the palace gate today

557
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:46,680
There is no way to lead

558
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:47,960
The whole city is under martial law

559
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:49,281
How to get out of Beijing

560
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,801
Unaccompanied woman

561
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:53,121
How to make a living

562
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,361
Even if you set up a career,

563
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,001
How to preserve

564
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,001
Zi Jin

565
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,720
What can we do

566
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,240
Is it the king's land under the whole world

567
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,720
Don't Princess Zhuang want to escape

568
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:11,281
She wants to

569
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,121
But where did you escape in the end

570
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,081
Even if you really escaped,

571
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:18,720
That is also Zhulianjiu clan

572
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:20,601
Flee

573
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,121
You can never escape

574
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:27,001
Since you can't escape,

575
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,841
Then stay

576
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,121
Purple Azolla

577
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,880
It's the wrong burial

578
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,801
Is the world wrong

579
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,601
Mistakes must be corrected

580
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:40,160
But it's an ancestral system

581
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,601
Even today's prince can't openly

582
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,281
I'm not afraid

583
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,680
Purple Azolla

584
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,240
Don't be afraid, either

585
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,601
Whenever you remember four words

586
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Man-made things

587
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,561
You think about it

588
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:57,041
Whether you are a female official,

589
00:42:57,761 --> 00:42:58,761
Or be a concubine

590
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:01,281
Even the most ordinary people

591
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,440
Who has no dilemma

592
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,321
There will always be a way out

593
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:13,480
Wherever you go

594
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:15,561
How far do you go

595
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:17,720
As long as someone is with you

596
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,801
Not alone

597
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,001
Have this belief

598
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:24,561
It can support me for a long time

599
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:27,121
End

600
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:30,400
Maybe it's the way out

601
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:14,321
Hu Si Shan

602
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,160
This is the medicated diet spectrum I wrote

603
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,841
Take time to look at it for me

604
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,081
She gave Princess Zhuang a jade pendant

605
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,561
Just walked out of Bei'an Gate safely

606
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:26,801
What kind of jade pendant
