1
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,799
I need a batch of clams from Liaodong

2
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,920
Specializing in treating women's disharmony of qi and blood

3
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,439
You find out

4
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,640
Arrive in Beijing in August and September

5
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,520
Yes

6
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:38,999
Your Highness

7
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,359
This medicinal material for treating disharmony between qi and blood

8
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,079
It was Dr. Sheng who told you

9
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,079
How do they know how to distinguish medicinal materials

10
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,320
What did I bring you here for

11
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,559
Don't help yet

12
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,400
Yes

13
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,279
If it arrives in Beijing in September,

14
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,919
Maybe it's sun-dried

15
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,400
Sun-drying

16
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,120
This

17
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,799
This is locked

18
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,400
It should be this thing

19
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:56,480
Help people over

20
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,240
Yes

21
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,240
Thank you, Your Highness

22
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,559
Royal Guards are really Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon

23
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,320
Stay another half an hour before leaving

24
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,199
Your Royal Highness Your Royal Highness

25
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:33,960
The humble position is wrong

26
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,680
The humble position is wrong

27
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,680
I followed you to protect your highness

28
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,240
Take away

29
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,320
Your Highness

30
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,719
Your Highness, come back

31
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:43,520
Your Highness

32
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,680
No

33
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,439
Is this a save or not

34
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,880
What are you two looking at

35
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,240
Come and help me

36
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,359
Wait for half an hour

37
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,320
Sure

38
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,559
Queen

39
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,160
Male and female servants. See Synonyms at Emperor

40
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,320
Deeper exposure

41
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,519
In poor health

42
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,719
Why do you have to see me

43
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,320
Ask Your Majesty's permission

44
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,760
Zhunsheng Taiyi

45
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,320
Continue to diagnose male and female servants and concubines

46
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,839
He gave the Queen a prescription before

47
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,519
Almost lead to human life

48
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,719
Fortunately, Long Si is safe

49
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll keep him alive

50
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,880
It's already mercy

51
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,999
How could the Queen believe him

52
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,920
Male and female servants believe in Sheng Taiyi

53
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,519
Dr. Sheng did not deceive your majesty either

54
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,480
Is it pregnancy or illness

55
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,640
Don't male and female servants understand themselves

56
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,519
Ask Your Majesty's permission

57
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,519
Dr. Sheng continued to treat me

58
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,200
Empress Empress

59
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:19,040
Dai Yuan sentenced him to be proficient in women's prescription

60
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,760
How can a mere happy pulse be consulted wrong

61
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,760
If you trust that quack

62
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,200
In case you hurt Long Si

63
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,200
Then who can afford to eat sin

64
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,880
There is no Long Si, Your Majesty

65
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:31,839
This matter is of great importance

66
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,239
Nature should not be neglected

67
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,279
Empress Empress

68
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,399
You go back to peace of mind first

69
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,920
How about Xuan Tai Yi asking for peace pulse for you again

70
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,480
Peace

71
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,679
Within three days

72
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,959
I will give up my breath here

73
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,480
Where is peace

74
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,480
Queen

75
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,080
Queen

76
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:05,719
Get up

77
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,320
It is a great good thing to meet happiness

78
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,480
How can you be full of nonsense

79
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:16,800
Father

80
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,600
The Empress is restless

81
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,239
Will say ominous words

82
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,399
I also ask my father to forgive me

83
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,600
Help your mother back to the palace

84
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,040
Your Majesty

85
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,760
I married into the royal family at the age of fifteen

86
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,559
Serve Your Majesty for more than 20 years

87
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,519
Give birth to three sons and one daughter

88
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
I don't ask for anything else

89
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,880
Just ask your majesty

90
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,080
Look at me

91
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,999
In order to serve you, I dedicated my life to serve you

92
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,760
Allow me to be willful once

93
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,239
Just for once

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
I want to see Dr. Sheng

95
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,640
I want to live

96
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,999
Ask Your Majesty for mercy

97
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,080
I ordered Tai Hospital to consult for you

98
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,999
Isn't it saving your life

99
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,279
Every woman in the world must have children

100
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,439
I've never seen you so crazy

101
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Queen

102
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,320
You had a baby

103
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,679
Can you tolerate a quack misdiagnosis

104
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,519
Let's lose one

105
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,360
A hard-won child

106
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,600
All consequences

107
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,920
I am willing to bear it with all my strength

108
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,839
Ask your majesty for help

109
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,959
Empress is the master of the six palaces

110
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,080
Mother instrument world

111
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,600
How can you say such a bizarre thing

112
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,880
Give birth to children for the royal family

113
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
It is the primary responsibility of the harem concubines

114
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,399
If I change my body,

115
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,999
My body is willing to give my life to save the dragon tire

116
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,760
How can an empress because

117
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,000
Can't stand some pain, then

118
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,279
Your Majesty

119
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,399
Cold moonlit night

120
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,719
You can no longer tolerate the Empress

121
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,839
Such a gaffe

122
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,800
If you really hurt Long Si,

123
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,399
Then what should I do

124
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:36,920
Help the Queen to return to Kunning Palace

125
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,360
Re-pass the decree

126
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,240
Summon all doctors to consult

127
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,040
Your Majesty

128
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:44,360
Your Majesty

129
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,519
Ask Your Majesty for mercy

130
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,680
I'm in pain

131
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,240
Ask Your Majesty to help me

132
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,319
Your Majesty

133
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:57,719
Your Majesty

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,199
Go ahead

135
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,079
Your Majesty

136
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,959
This hour

137
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:13,959
Go quickly

138
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,399
Yes

139
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,879
Queen

140
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Come

141
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,920
Male and female servants and concubines gaffe today

142
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,560
Ask Your Majesty for forgiveness

143
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
Male and female servants and concubines retire

144
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,600
Before the Imperial Examinee

145
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,879
Always praise the queen for being deferential and wise

146
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,240
I also take her as my wife everywhere

147
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,440
How did the Queen become today

148
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
Like another person

149
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,480
So

150
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
Be so arbitrary

151
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,440
So

152
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,920
Irresponsible

153
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,120
Your Majesty

154
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,440
Your Majesty

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Wu Cairen

156
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,360
The empress has no guests today

157
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,440
Please go back

158
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm not going in there to bother

159
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,319
I'll be right here

160
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
When the Empress gets better,

161
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I'll go in and say hello again

162
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,399
Come on in with me

163
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,600
You go down first

164
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,199
Your Highness

165
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,519
What's in that sack

166
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,519
It still moves

167
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,040
Go back

168
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,279
Go back now

169
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,319
I'm not a doctor

170
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,199
How much it gets in the way here

171
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,440
Then you just let Mei Nvguan

172
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,759
No matter how persuaded, he refused to leave

173
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,279
Don't let your highness see it with his own eyes

174
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,000
I serve here

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,879
How can I get there

176
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,879
So that the Crown Princess can specialize in beauty

177
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,759
So now is the critical moment

178
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,759
You can't leave even more

179
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:54,240
In this deep palace

180
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,959
Pampering is indispensable, but it is also indispensable

181
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,600
No more, no less than me is enough

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,560
Let's go

183
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:07,639
Mother

184
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,319
Your Highness

185
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:14,519
Mother

186
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:16,600
Zhan Yong Zhan Zhao and Jiaxing

187
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,839
Crying to see you

188
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,319
They're worried about you

189
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,519
But I've had them sent back first

190
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:22,879
When you feel better,

191
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,399
Let them come and greet you again

192
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,160
Good

193
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,319
Mother

194
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,440
This time I brought Sheng Yin

195
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Take your pulse personally

196
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,120
His Royal Highness the Prince

197
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,879
Your Majesty has made a decree

198
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,440
Sheng Yin is not allowed to enter the palace again

199
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:39,879
Your Highness

200
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,600
It's against the rules

201
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,319
It's the rules that matter

202
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,440
Or is mother's life important

203
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,600
Sheng Yin

204
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:49,560
Yes

205
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:50,719
I

206
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,719
How

207
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:11,440
Your Highness

208
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,480
Fortunately, you made a quick decision

209
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:14,879
If in another three days

210
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,440
Hua Tuo can't be cured again

211
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,639
Sheng Tai Yi

212
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,040
The empress's illness is really so serious

213
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,120
The empress's pulse is heavy and tight

214
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,000
Lackluster

215
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,040
Neither slippery pulse nor pregnancy

216
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,240
But the meridians are blocked

217
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:32,160
Poor blood gas

218
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,600
Dangyi Taoren Chengqi Decoction

219
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,079
Hedidang Decoction promotes blood circulation and removes blood stasis

220
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,240
However

221
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,920
They have been taking medicine to prevent miscarriage and nourish their spirits

222
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,240
Warming meridians to stop bleeding

223
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,600
The more nature makes up, the more serious the illness is

224
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,079
Amenorrhea for 4 months

225
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,399
And abdominal pain

226
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,000
It's not pregnancy. What is it

227
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,360
As for the slippery pulse, it is flickering

228
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,360
That's the empress who is weak

229
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,680
Happy pulse just doesn't show

230
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,800
Your Highness

231
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,399
Taoren Chengqi Decoction has peach kernel and rhubarb

232
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,560
There are leeches and flies in Didang soup

233
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,639
Both prescriptions are blood stasis-removing drugs

234
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,160
Pregnant women taboo

235
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,519
Sheng Yin

236
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,120
You made a name for yourself

237
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,680
Damage the life of dragon fetus

238
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,399
This is a capital crime

239
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,800
His Royal Highness the Prince

240
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,399
Never listen to what quacks say

241
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,879
He went down with this dose of medicine

242
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,839
Don't say dragon tire

243
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,040
Phoenix body is also at stake

244
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,040
Your Highness

245
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,519
Previous diagnosis of handmaiden

246
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,560
It is indeed a slippery pulse

247
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,399
Please think twice, Your Highness

248
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,480
Everyone talks about gold

249
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,199
Accumulation and destruction of bones

250
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,759
After all, there are too many mediocre people in the world

251
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,079
Your Highness

252
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,839
I don't need to say much

253
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,920
I hope your highness will decide

254
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:43,759
Your Highness

255
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,160
Imperial doctors can prescribe medicines to patients

256
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,440
But you can't make decisions for patients

257
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,560
Mother

258
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You have told me since you were a child

259
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,759
Be decisive in your life

260
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,440
Hesitation is bad for great things

261
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,639
So my son's way of dealing with people

262
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,440
They are all like mothers

263
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Even if you go the wrong way

264
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,560
Overcome difficulties and thorns

265
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,800
We must also go out of a bloody road

266
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
But now it's a matter of life

267
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,879
It is up to the mother to decide for herself

268
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,800
If you think Sheng Yin is right

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,920
Your son supports you

270
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,800
Your Highness

271
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,519
In case the emperor blames

272
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,879
My son is watching outside

273
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,160
No one will bother

274
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,199
You can rest assured

275
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,360
My son has always been with you

276
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,239
Please Sheng Yin

277
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,040
Intake medicine

278
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,279
Yes

279
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,239
Your Majesty

280
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,479
You have to make decisions

281
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,759
What's going on

282
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,599
Your Majesty

283
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,239
You must stop the crown prince

284
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,160
He insisted that Sheng Yin heal the empress

285
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,160
I am afraid

286
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,479
I'm afraid this time Long Si really can't keep it

287
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,160
Arrogance

288
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,840
Your Majesty

289
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,239
Qikai empress just took the medicine

290
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,200
Your Majesty

291
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,119
Zhu Zhanji

292
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,840
Where is that quack

293
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,999
Your Majesty is here

294
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,759
Dr. Sheng, this is

295
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,359
Back to the Imperial Concubine Empress

296
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,239
I have made a written pledge to fulfill a military order before your highness

297
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,999
If you can't cure the empress,

298
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,440
I am willing to die

299
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,560
Sheng Yin you

300
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,119
You, you made a big mistake

301
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,040
Wearing a court sentence

302
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,759
Do you dare to follow my oath in public

303
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:28,560
You

304
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,599
If you can't cure the empress within ten days,

305
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,479
I'll take the head on your neck

306
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,200
Your Majesty

307
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,359
Two digits

308
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,399
Can dare

309
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,639
Your Majesty

310
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,720
Imperial doctors rely on medical skills to diagnose diseases

311
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,080
Not ignorance and fearlessness

312
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,080
Threatened with a knife and axe rashly

313
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,560
Imperial doctor is frightened

314
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,920
How to diagnose and treat with peace of mind

315
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,320
Sheng Yin

316
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,160
Don't speak wildly

317
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,879
If you hurt Long Si,

318
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,440
How can I get compensation for taking your head

319
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,519
Zhu Zhanji

320
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,560
Is this one of your tricks

321
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,599
Teach them

322
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,720
Father

323
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,479
Please respect the mother's decision

324
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,279
I don't respect your mother

325
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,960
If I don't respect her,

326
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,920
How can you call a doctor for consultation

327
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,960
Why did you come to visit in the middle of the night

328
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,200
Zhu Zhanji

329
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,040
Do you know that

330
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,599
Maybe because of one of your mistakes

331
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,920
It will ruin your mother's life

332
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,080
And the unborn child

333
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,440
You, you laugh

334
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,479
Smile, smile, smile, smile

335
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,960
Father

336
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,840
When you were the East Palace,

337
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,720
Do not hesitate to offend Grandpa Huang, but also stick to his heart

338
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,680
Brave admonition

339
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,479
As your wife

340
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:43,879
Mother is always by your side

341
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:45,479
Love is undiminished

342
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,800
Did she ever ask you about the consequences of doing so

343
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,080
Has she ever had a trace of fear and retreat

344
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,080
She never

345
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,599
What do you do

346
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,800
As long as you want to do it, she won't ask

347
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,200
I resolutely supported it

348
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,639
But if it were you

349
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,200
Why don't you trust her once

350
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,279
If you can't cure the queen

351
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,879
I don't want your head

352
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm going to destroy your door

353
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:25,879
Your Majesty

354
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,840
After the empress took the medicine,

355
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:29,160
Sure enough, there were a lot of blood stasis

356
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,639
The spirit is also good

357
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,279
Purple Azolla

358
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,680
I'll do it

359
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,479
You worked here all night last night

360
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,519
Only when cooking

361
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,359
My heart is calm

362
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:15,920
Last night

363
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,519
Empress Empress used blood medicine

364
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,239
Except for the stasis

365
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:21,160
Afraid of deficiency of qi and blood

366
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,840
Today, it is advisable to use medicated diet for invigorating qi and benefiting blood

367
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,160
I want to prepare in advance

368
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,759
You do the work alone

369
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,440
All the credit was divided by others

370
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,320
With what

371
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,999
The more you practice, the better your skills

372
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,080
Until no one can replace it

373
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,479
Is unique

374
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,560
Losses are blessings

375
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,639
It's not all deceptive

376
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,759
Row

377
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,440
To please the Empress

378
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,200
Is to please the crown prince

379
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,720
Purple Azolla

380
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,879
There is something hidden in my heart all the time

381
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,599
It's about my past

382
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,320
I want to tell you today

383
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,720
Yao Ziliao

384
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,800
Please treat the empress to dinner

385
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,639
This longan medlar pigeon egg soup

386
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,680
Supplementing Qi, enriching blood, nourishing yin and moistening lung

387
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,080
It should be taken first

388
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,040
Are these bergamot petals on it

389
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,840
Back to the empress's words

390
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,279
This meal is called Chicken with Bergamot

391
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,040
There is a peculiar taste in the entrance

392
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:23,840
Like fermented bean curd

393
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,840
No

394
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,720
Lingering on the tip of the tongue

395
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,479
It smells like wine again

396
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,160
Back to the empress

397
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,200
This recipe contains

398
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,840
Tofu milk and glutinous rice wine

399
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,800
Glutinous rice wine warms the middle and benefits qi

400
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,279
It was specially selected by the handmaiden for you

401
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,840
You have a heart

402
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,040
Empress

403
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,639
You slow down

404
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,160
Empress

405
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,440
You are recovering from your illness

406
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,840
Don't eat too much

407
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,639
Crispy skin and juicy inside

408
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,479
It tastes really good

409
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,999
It's a pity

410
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,440
It has been many, many years

411
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,160
I don't smell this smell anymore

412
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,560
Queen Zhang is a native of Yongcheng

413
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,720
I like to use hot soup with fried dumplings for breakfast

414
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,479
You are proficient in famous dishes from all over the world

415
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,399
How can you not even know this thing

416
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,800
It's just some street snacks

417
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,519
How can you offer such crude food

418
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,519
There are more than 20 kinds of ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines in the soup

419
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,639
Adjust according to the changes of the four seasons

420
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,040
The Queen asked about the recipe

421
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,160
You are speechless

422
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,399
In this way

423
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,399
The empress knows that there is another person who makes the meal

424
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,639
What a waste of the opportunity I gave you

425
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,560
Empress

426
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,759
Your phoenix body is recovering

427
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,200
Otherwise, we'll do it after a while

428
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,200
Do you know the origin of this spinning wheel

429
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,639
Handmaiden heard

430
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,960
This was given to you by Queen Renxiao in those days

431
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:53,800
Yeah

432
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,639
When my mother gave it to me, she said

433
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,119
One husband does not plow

434
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,239
Or suffer from hunger

435
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,639
A woman does not knit

436
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,840
Or suffer from cold

437
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Male ploughing and female weaving

438
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,920
The husband sings along with the woman

439
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,160
It is the best in the world

440
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,800
Yes

441
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,040
Empress

442
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,279
Empress

443
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,239
What a pity that the spinning wheel has been smashed

444
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,519
Empress sent it to Shangshi Bureau

445
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:36,879
When the firewood burns

446
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,359
Yes

447
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:47,680
Father

448
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:50,960
Why are you here

449
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,040
I heard that my father's dragon body is not safe

450
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,840
My son came to plead guilty

451
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:04,960
Father

452
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,040
Take the medicine first

453
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,160
Wei Chen came late

454
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,200
Please pardon the emperor

455
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:28,200
Guangzong County, Shunde Prefecture has a lot of rain this year

456
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,639
The local report is late

457
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,960
Life and life delayed the disaster relief

458
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,200
I have already made a decree

459
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,080
However, natural disasters

460
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,440
Be sure to open the warehouse for relief first

461
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,759
But in this way

462
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,399
There must be officials who are greedy for ink

463
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,680
Are you going to

464
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,200
Father

465
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:50,160
If you are worried about local officials

466
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:51,920
Take advantage of disaster relief to enrich oneself

467
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,840
You can send patrol according to the censor to visit

468
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,840
However, the empire went to check with great fanfare

469
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:00,920
As far as eyes and ears can see

470
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,639
It's just that others want to see it

471
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,359
At a young age

472
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,119
What do you know

473
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:08,440
Father

474
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,759
Now the Royal Guards are out of Beijing to get people

475
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,800
Arrests often occur without permission

476
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,200
It is conceivable

477
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,080
How arrogant are you on weekdays

478
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,080
If you order them to visit secretly again,

479
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:21,519
I'm afraid there will be more illegal things

480
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
When Grandpa Huang was here,

481
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,440
They will restrain themselves a little

482
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,519
Now

483
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,200
It's me

484
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:29,479
It's me

485
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:34,440
Let the Royal Guards act cheaply

486
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,519
Father

487
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,440
Out

488
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,800
Verbal collision between children and ministers

489
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,479
Please take care of the dragon body

490
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,479
If you mother and son hadn't joined hands to anger me

491
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,160
I am in good health

492
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,320
Why don't you go

493
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,800
My son retires

494
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,720
Inverse

495
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,879
I have read the paper you presented

496
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,599
It's fairly pertinent

497
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,479
But those things are worried by ministers of various ministries and hospitals

498
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,440
Don't worry about it

499
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,399
One mutilates Zhongliang

500
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:52,999
Butchers who kill countless people

501
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,560
I will learn from people who are full of reading to give advice to the emperor

502
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,200
What capital has water transportation to solve households' difficulties

503
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,160
Have nowhere to live

504
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,040
It's simply nonsense

505
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,560
I dare not talk loudly

506
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,759
People only need a few strokes

507
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,119
Talk to guests and friends at Lord Liu's banquet yesterday

508
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,200
Write it down one by one

509
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:13,560
Your head will be in danger tomorrow

510
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:16,320
Don't stain my eyes with this pickling thing

511
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,519
This is

512
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,879
Your Majesty

513
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Recurrence of old disease

514
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,560
Dai Yuan ruled that the dragon body must be conditioned according to the prescription

515
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,359
You can't be vegetarian anymore

516
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:08,879
Help quickly

517
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:09,479
Move in

518
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:12,599
Move things in together

519
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:13,759
Come here

520
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:16,960
Come

521
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:18,960
Be careful

522
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,759
You bring it

523
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,519
This is what the Imperial Concubine of Yongning Palace wants

524
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,279
You can't take it

525
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,639
Do you have eyes

526
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,080
Dare to occupy the Queen's master's things

527
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:37,920
You let go

528
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:38,999
Give it to me

529
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,999
Give it to me

530
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,040
Don't take mine

531
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,639
What are you doing noisily

532
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,999
Sister Yu Lu

533
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,840
It is clearly the black wolfberry set by Kunning Palace

534
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
She insisted that the imperial concubine should use it

535
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
I have to take it all away

536
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,639
We made a reservation three days ago

537
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,200
It's just that it doesn't match for a while

538
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,680
There must be a first come, first served

539
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:57,200
Let go

540
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,519
You all took it

541
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,879
What am I going to tell you

542
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,519
Stop

543
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,080
Jade chowder

544
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,680
It doesn't matter if the little palace maidservants do something wrong and scold them

545
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:08,999
Who gave you permission to do it

546
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,999
Again

547
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,519
The imperial concubine prepared black wolfberry

548
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,320
It is to cure the emperor's heart disease

549
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,840
Who can go over the emperor

550
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:16,999
Give me Chinese wolfberry

551
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,399
I

552
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,399
Give it to me

553
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:21,999
Give it to me

554
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,519
This is decided by the Imperial Concubine

555
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,960
Mine

556
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,320
Sure

557
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,320
This black wolfberry was born in the mountains

558
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,200
Hard to come by

559
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,040
You dare to knock over such precious medicinal materials

560
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,960
Clearly you let go first

561
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,399
Why are you framing me? You knocked it over

562
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,160
You

563
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,920
Look at the canon meal

564
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,680
Parsley can make a big disaster

565
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:43,279
I

566
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,320
Something heartless

567
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,559
Dare to abuse anything

568
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,039
Everyone misses. Say it well

569
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,359
So loud and noisy

570
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,720
What did it look like when outsiders heard it

571
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:54,480
Pack up quickly

572
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,920
I have no one behind me

573
00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:59,599
Naturally, I dare not be presumptuous

574
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,359
Which is better than the upper sister

575
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,559
I am rushing to settle vegetables with others

576
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,680
It's about to climb the high branch

577
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,720
You

578
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,920
Be cruel to others

579
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,720
His face has changed

580
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,839
This is a painful foot, isn't it

581
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,280
I let you fall

582
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,720
Xuelu, you take it

583
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:23,760
Let go

584
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,720
Don't take it

585
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,559
Can't take it

586
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:27,680
I really can't take it

587
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,200
Don't spoil it

588
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,399
You can't take it

589
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,480
Stop fighting

590
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,200
Recipe canon meal

591
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,000
Recipe canon meal

592
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:42,879
Recipe canon meal

593
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,399
Don't take it

594
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,920
You

595
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,240
Come here

596
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:49,680
Stay

597
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,440
Stop

598
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:53,599
Let you fight

599
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:55,879
Purple Azolla

600
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,879
Yin Ziping

601
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:57,599
Don't take it

602
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,359
Stop fighting

603
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,200
Stop fighting

604
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,960
Don't take it

605
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,920
Stop fighting

606
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,599
Purple Azolla

607
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,680
Purple Azolla

608
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,520
Stop

609
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,240
Here comes Lord Shang Shi

610
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,200
Don't stop it all yet

611
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:15,000
Kneel down, kneel down

612
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,079
Kneel for an hour

613
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,319
Meditate on the past

614
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,039
I

615
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,639
Kneel well

616
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,599
Pretend

617
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,359
What about you

618
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:39,520
What to fight

619
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,639
The emperor's golden words

620
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,399
Reinstated Meng's official position

621
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,319
I can't refute your majesty's wishes either

622
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,119
The Love of Man

623
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,200
Seek profit

624
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,559
If you want to be in charge of the food bureau,

625
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,920
Everyone must be convinced

626
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:08,960
Otherwise

627
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,599
Even if I do,

628
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:11,720
It's hard for you to convince the public

629
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:13,960
Empress

630
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,639
Handmaiden has confidence

631
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:18,839
On Qualifications

632
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
Monteggia is far above you

633
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I want you to compete fairly

634
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,920
Empress Empress

635
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,200
Go down

636
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:40,520
Empress Empress

637
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,079
Your Majesty has just issued a decree

638
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,240
Guo Guifei's brother Guo Ming attacked the Marquis of Wuding

639
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,000
Grandmother Yan surpassed the system and was named the Duchess of Yingguo

640
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,000
Mother Xu was named Mrs. Tai

641
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,079
And

642
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,319
The first emperor nearly served Huang Yan and had an affair with foreign ministers

643
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,799
After Huang Yanyan took over,

644
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,920
All the assets under his name also belong to Wudinghou

645
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,599
Everything is planned before moving

646
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,200
Be too impatient

647
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,480
Can't achieve great things

648
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,520
Yes

649
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,559
Granddaughter Guo Duansushu's grandmother's knee

650
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,799
Self-serving and merciful

651
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,680
Over summer and over autumn

652
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,599
Recent news of grandmother's disharmony in daily life

653
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,839
The special envoy will lead the imperial doctor

654
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,720
Go and say hello

655
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,039
Jade Beijing

656
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,559
You must send this letter

657
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,160
Hand it over to grandmother

658
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,680
And bring me a few words

659
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,799
Kishito Tomoki

660
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,000
So help the top

661
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,319
Courtesy, frugality and modesty

662
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:57,799
So self-control

663
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,839
Please ask your grandmother to give birth to brothers, sons and nephews in the discipline clan

664
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,720
To protect our Guo family

665
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,920
Long-term peace and wealth

666
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,200
Empress

667
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,559
Now your own brother has attacked the marquis

668
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,039
It can be seen that your majesty treats Guo's family with great favor

669
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,720
Even the Queen's maiden family is far less than that

670
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,039
You should be happy

671
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,920
Why are you still so worried

672
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,440
I'm glad

673
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,079
Someone will be unhappy

674
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,039
If you can't be prepared for danger in times of peace

675
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,440
Disaster

676
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:29,879
Not far away

677
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,359
Yes

678
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,200
Wait a minute

679
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,280
Here

680
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,160
It is a thousand-year-old wild ginseng and a thousand-year-old Ganoderma lucidum

681
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,319
This is the medicine from Tai Hospital

682
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,039
Old people are getting old

683
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,879
Weak and sick, susceptible to wind and cold

684
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:56,559
This is specially given by the imperial doctor

685
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,680
You take it with you

686
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,000
You should be careful to observe the maid around the old grandmother

687
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,559
In case there is poor care,

688
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,960
Get rid of it at once

689
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:04,920
Yes

690
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,680
Be careful on the road

691
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:38,920
Let's go

692
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,960
Your Highness is back

693
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,799
Why are you here

694
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,039
Didn't your highness love this solitude best before

695
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,839
Just because the strings are broken

696
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,760
What a pity

697
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,440
Now I have found it

698
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,160
Silk strings matching the original piano

699
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,799
Replaced it for your highness

700
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,200
You listen

701
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,240
The voice is as clear and mellow as before

702
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,559
Why don't I play a song for your highness

703
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:27,760
Relieve your highness's boredom

704
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:28,720
No need

705
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
Someone will sort it out

706
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,520
If your highness is bored,

707
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,240
Can you tell my body

708
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:00,960
Although I am stupid,

709
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:03,119
May not be able to solve your highness's worries

710
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,319
But if you speak your heart,

711
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,920
It won't be left untold

712
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,039
Your Highness, stay with the piano

713
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,680
Thank you for your trouble

714
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:13,760
If nothing else

715
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:15,200
I'll see you another day

716
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,639
Your Highness

717
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,879
What else is there

718
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,480
A rudimentary study

719
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,839
It is not a place to live for a long time

720
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:34,280
The mother is afraid that people will lose their care again

721
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,240
Sent me to consult with your highness

722
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,520
Let's go back to live

723
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,480
People come and go in the palace every day

724
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,160
It's very noisy

725
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:41,680
Compared with here

726
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:42,879
Lack of elegance

727
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,240
I'll live here

728
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,599
Where is Your Highness

729
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,440
Where should I be, too

730
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,319
Since you won't move away

731
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,520
Then from tomorrow

732
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:52,160
I often come to keep company

733
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:54,440
When your highness is busy

734
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,839
I will grind ink and pour tea

735
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,280
If you are free

736
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,839
Talk with you again to relieve boredom

737
00:42:59,359 --> 00:42:59,920
How well

738
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,280
I told you so long ago

739
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,039
You don't have to serve day and night

740
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:05,639
When the former mother and queen were the Eastern Palace concubines,

741
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,359
Every father's diet and daily life

742
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,839
Will take care of it personally

743
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,280
This is the duty of being a wife

744
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,480
Once upon a time, because your highness was tolerant,

745
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,799
I am more slack

746
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,559
Now it is a serious mend

747
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,200
If I say no, I don't have to

748
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,280
Yuan Qi

749
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,399
Send the Crown Princess back

750
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,440
Yes

751
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,760
Crown Princess

752
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:25,680
You please

753
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:29,879
I'll come back tomorrow

754
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:36,879
You don't have to send it

755
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Serve your highness well

756
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:49,480
Your Highness

757
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,079
Do you see

758
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,079
How do I feel

759
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:57,000
Today, this crown princess

760
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,440
It's different from usual

761
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,799
What time is it

762
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,079
Why hasn't the meal been delivered yet

763
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:05,280
Sent it, sent it

764
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
It was already delivered

765
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,280
Miss Yao has put the food box

766
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,200
It's out there

767
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,960
Weren't the Crown Princess here just now

768
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:17,200
