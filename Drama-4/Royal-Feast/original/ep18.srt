1
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,641
Why on earth is Yao Ziliao

2
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,401
Su Yuehua

3
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,361
You can't afford to lose, can you deliberately provoke

4
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,961
Ziping, tell me why you won

5
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:28,961
You speak

6
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,920
People should be willing to gamble and admit defeat

7
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,520
Purple Azolla

8
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:35,041
Purple Azolla

9
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,401
You mustn't talk

10
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,160
At that time, the empress was clear

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,481
There must be something wrong with this

12
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,681
You tell me

13
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:02,640
What the hell did you do

14
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,440
Wang Mocha loves to attend Zen and worship Buddha

15
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,201
But the real Wangchuan map

16
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,280
There are boat tourists

17
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:13,041
Only there are no monks

18
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Monk

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The old monk under the tree

20
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:25,880
Emperor Taizu once entered Huangjue Temple as a monk

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
I hate people the most in my life

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,041
Hang bald monks on your lips

23
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,440
If anyone in the Forbidden City dares to say a word,

24
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,761
The consequences are unimaginable

25
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,360
But now times have changed

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,880
Few people in the palace remember this taboo

27
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,841
But the empress knows it well

28
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
How can I let you win

29
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:45,640
It turns out that you are deliberately misleading me

30
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,000
Su Yuehua

31
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,240
People catch rats in their own homes

32
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,201
Who let you keep good people wrong

33
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
You have to get in at one end

34
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,921
Purple Azolla

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,481
It's just a small skill to carve insects

36
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Today's competition

37
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:05,240
I am the one

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,961
I won

39
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,201
Moon flower

40
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,440
What do you think is the hardest part of the real Wangchuan map

41
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,360
Is it really to reproduce the artistic conception in the painting

42
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,640
Isn't it

43
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:23,520
Wang Chuan map sample

44
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:26,321
It is indeed the most exquisite fancy cold dish in the world

45
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,041
It's a pity to meet the cold season

46
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Be blown by a cold wind

47
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,280
All the ingredients will become more and more cold and hard

48
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,961
The function of viewing is far greater than eating

49
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,041
I had already thought about it

50
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:42,280
Use the method of carving and preserving flowers in Jingzhou, Huguang

51
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,481
Make all the ingredients into candied fruit in advance

52
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:46,761
For noble people to taste

53
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:48,360
What a pity

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,641
You stole the painting

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
Everything I can think of

56
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:55,880
You will not think of it in advance

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
Because you put all your thoughts

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,120
It's all on showing off skills

59
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,801
I forgot that the ingredients will eventually be imported

60
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,801
The picture of Wangchuan has been beautifully restored

61
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,481
If you use this talent in the side door,

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,120
Then you are on the road of cooking

63
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,521
It really stops there

64
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,241
Zouziliao

65
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,321
Ignore her

66
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:25,560
I can't see it

67
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,160
That's awesome

68
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,680
Lord You

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,241
Believe whatever I draw

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,880
You can't really be so naive, can you

71
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,120
Let's go

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,081
That's boring

73
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,160
You can't afford to lose

74
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
All right

75
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:12,120
The person sent for the painting did not look closely at the painting

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,120
I told her to make a trap

77
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,120
But it's interesting for you to come and go

78
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:18,761
Just lost once

79
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,720
Why do you look so ugly

80
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,560
She has never been so serious

81
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,641
What the hell happened

82
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:39,120
The high-rise buildings on the city are cut too clearly

83
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,201
Late coming overlooking Enigmatic

84
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,601
Xishan is green and connected with the East China Sea

85
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,761
Nanji Zhouche Club Beijing

86
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,521
Red brocade gardens should shine at night

87
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,880
Huang Yun sees Qiu Cheng in Longmu

88
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
The sky is vast and clear

89
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
Watching Feihong Wanli Levy

90
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,041
How

91
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,041
Good poetry, good poetry

92
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:14,641
Your Highness

93
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,160
Climbing the stairs and overlooking last night

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Is there a beauty on the boat

95
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,680
What kind of eyes

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,361
Where does the beauty come from in the dead of night

97
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,280
It's more like having a female ghost

98
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:25,601
It looks more and more like a person

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Full of nonsense

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,521
But where is it like when you believe in a pen

101
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,840
It's not like

102
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,000
Handmaiden's eyesight

103
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,201
Wrong, wrong

104
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,521
Damn handmaiden damn handmaiden damn

105
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:46,400
Damn handmaiden

106
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:48,921
Your Highness

107
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,241
Hu Shangshi was my carelessness

108
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,601
Please forgive me

109
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,400
Just now, a will came from Kunning Palace

110
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,441
From now on

111
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,640
You are no longer the standard meal of the Shang Food Bureau

112
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,121
Hu Shang Shi

113
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,361
Please allow me to have a second chance to compete

114
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,121
You have already lost the first game

115
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,361
I dare to talk big

116
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,561
Don't go out yet

117
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:39,801
If you lose again in the second game

118
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:41,160
What to do

119
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,400
Just me

120
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:46,041
Can beat Yao Ziliao

121
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,361
What kind of person is she

122
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,881
It's not worth mentioning at all

123
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,241
If it were me

124
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,361
I can give you one last chance

125
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,241
But if you lose again this time

126
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,840
He left the Shang Food Bureau forever

127
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,640
Yes

128
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,121
The Knife Skill of Su Dian Food

129
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:25,241
It's really a little superb

130
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:27,241
You see

131
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,681
The mountains and the waters

132
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,160
It's really a bit of the artistic conception of the original painting

133
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:34,280
Descendants of famous chef Su

134
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:35,881
Nature is extraordinary

135
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:37,801
What a pity

136
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,561
The Queen intended to help Hu Shanwei

137
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,561
Nature will not judge fairly

138
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,561
The old monk who participated in Zen meditation

139
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,681
Can predict the Queen's mind so accurately

140
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,640
You still have Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the Food Bureau

141
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:57,601
The tricks of young people can't hide from the eyes of empress

142
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,601
Wang Mocha's Wangchuan Map and the Old Monk Participating in Zen

143
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,681
It also brings out the best in each other

144
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,881
It's just a competition in the second game

145
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,801
It is not up to the empresses of the harem to decide

146
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,760
What the imperial concubine means is

147
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,561
The East Palace will invite the important ministers in the DPRK on behalf of the emperor

148
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,160
Youtai liquid pool

149
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:21,121
What about the competition in the second game

150
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,441
It was set in Xiyuan

151
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,520
Your Highness

152
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,160
Golden Jade Soup Just Delivered

153
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,001
I know you don't like it too sweet

154
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,241
They were specially ordered to release little honey

155
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
Only seasoned with sweet-scented osmanthus

156
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:52,921
You try it

157
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,041
Your Highness

158
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,561
Recently, it is either writing or drawing

159
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,361
Don't you have to deal with government affairs

160
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,041
I seldom have time to spend more time with you

161
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:12,320
Isn't it good

162
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:14,801
Once upon a time, when the first emperor was there,

163
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,601
Not to take you north to hunt

164
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,361
Is to force you to assist in government affairs

165
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,241
You can't finish reading the throne

166
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,881
Even I can't see you

167
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:24,640
Now your highness has free time

168
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:25,840
I am naturally glad

169
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:27,960
It's just that my father didn't ascend to the throne long ago

170
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,881
There are many government affairs

171
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,320
Your Highness, as a country, Chu Jun

172
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,640
It should be shared for him more

173
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
If he is willing to let me help him share it, then

174
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,840
Your Highness, it's time to get cold

175
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:46,681
I'm tired

176
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:57,041
Crown Princess

177
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,241
Your Highness, he

178
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:01,520
It seems that everything in the past

179
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,241
Your Highness has never forgotten for a moment

180
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,720
Temple

181
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,200
There is no burning of felt

182
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:16,640
What kind of Lei Gong chestnut to simmer

183
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,241
Start, start, start, start

184
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,840
Come on with pleasure today

185
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,640
Be sure to enjoy yourself and return home

186
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,601
Your Highness, look

187
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,760
Your Highness

188
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,641
Your Highness

189
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:50,960
The emperor has come up

190
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,680
Big Brother Big Brother

191
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:58,001
Your Highness, isn't the emperor ill

192
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,881
Here comes the Holy Drive

193
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,161
Notify the kitchen

194
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:01,920
Prepare meals

195
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:02,840
Yes

196
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:12,320
Father

197
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:15,121
See Your Majesty

198
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:15,881
Avoid

199
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,720
Thank Your Majesty

200
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:36,401
Quick, quick, quick

201
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:37,241
Quickly

202
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,080
Put this over there

203
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,601
Come here, this way

204
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,361
Gently, gently

205
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,641
Don't disturb the Holy driving

206
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,481
Father-in-law Zhao

207
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,481
Noble people don't have ears

208
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,601
How can you hear it at such a distance

209
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,440
Your boy is too long, isn't he

210
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,881
Do what you should do

211
00:18:57,641 --> 00:18:58,401
Father-in-law Zhao

212
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,200
Just let them do these little things

213
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,121
Why bother you to order yourself

214
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:06,200
Last time Your Majesty came to Xiyuan

215
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,920
Eat something cold

216
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,001
The cold wind blew again

217
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,761
As a result, I went back to a serious illness

218
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,761
So the Queen asked me to come this time

219
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,040
Is to charge you

220
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,720
These wild birds bear fruit

221
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,281
Be sure to be extra careful

222
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,200
Please rest assured that Father Zhao will understand

223
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:23,521
Those two are busy first

224
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,001
It's a good sword

225
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,481
The sovereign listened to your words

226
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,800
The first one is advised in the above table

227
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:11,481
Sure enough, he won the favor of the emperor

228
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,241
You don't have to send anything to me in the future

229
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:14,881
I don't lack anything

230
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,440
Sovereign charge

231
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:17,481
Be careful in everything

232
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,481
This is the wind and cold

233
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,680
The prince will entertain you on my behalf

234
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,800
Then the King of Zhao came

235
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:37,720
Our brothers have been for a long time

236
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,800
There is no swimming in Xiyuan together

237
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,920
So today, everyone is together

238
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:51,960
As soon as your majesty ascended the throne,

239
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,761
It increased the age of my brother

240
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,481
Imperial grace is so mighty

241
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:57,761
My brother is grateful

242
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:59,840
Naturally, I want to go to the palace to give thanks

243
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,761
We're brothers

244
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:06,800
Don't be polite

245
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,241
Come and sit down

246
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:09,320
Brother Xie Huang

247
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,320
Ayan

248
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,001
Come here

249
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,001
When you finish the copybook I sent you,

250
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,840
I'll take you to release the eagle, okay

251
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:20,920
Really

252
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,521
Wei Wang grew up

253
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:27,881
I am very close to His Royal Highness the Prince

254
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,481
My favorite person in the world is Big Brother

255
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:37,281
Brother Emperor

256
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:39,761
Although the prince is young,

257
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,960
But quite prestigious

258
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,361
And won the hearts of the people

259
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,001
Even King Wei admired him so much

260
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,440
No wonder my father used to tell us when he was around

261
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
This one day Taiping Son of Heaven also

262
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,281
What I care most about on weekdays

263
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:26,121
Is the sufferings of the people

264
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,800
Object discussion between the government and the public

265
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,761
You all serve the first emperor

266
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,401
A loyal minister for more than 20 years

267
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:36,361
It is the pillar of the country

268
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:40,080
If there are any omissions in my future administration,

269
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
I hope you guys

270
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,361
Take out this seal for correcting mistakes

271
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,800
Dense and sparse to smell

272
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,121
I

273
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,241
Be sure to consider it

274
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,241
I give you this seal

275
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,800
I just want to get along honestly between the monarch and his subjects

276
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:04,241
The last thing I like is flattery

277
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,680
What I love most is the truth

278
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:10,601
From the heart

279
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,761
I wait for a decree to thank you

280
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,401
Ai Qing

281
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:30,401
What advice do you have

282
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,401
Your Majesty's administration is clear and there is no deficiency in political affairs

283
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,960
How dare I speak nonsense

284
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,241
Zhong Ai Qing

285
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,601
It is a good thing that my father can ask for words in coachable

286
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,840
But it's hard to relax in the garden today

287
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,361
Why don't you leave government affairs for the time being

288
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,281
Wait for them to consider it carefully

289
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,521
It's not too late to give advice to my father

290
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,881
His Royal Highness is right

291
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,761
Your Majesty, please let me wait and think about it

292
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:10,481
As soon as I ascended the throne, I gave an order of admonition

293
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,521
But today

294
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:19,080
There is no admonition of loving Qing

295
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:23,440
Good

296
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,241
Just

297
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:27,960
Everybody up, please

298
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,040
Thank Your Majesty

299
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:21,680
The fish tuna is really delicious this season

300
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,960
Father

301
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:24,641
Fish tuna is delicious

302
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,560
But it's a fishy thing after all

303
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,680
Extremely cold in the stomach

304
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,960
Fear of hurting dragon body

305
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,080
Get out of here

306
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,521
Eat less oil and don't eat too much

307
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,121
In case you get sick

308
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,641
How can you accompany me to release the eagle

309
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:31,001
Isn't Big Brother delicious

310
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:43,001
Big Brother, this is crisp and delicious

311
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,601
Mingming tastes best

312
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,761
Excuse me, is Yao Zhang's meal there

313
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,040
I am

314
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,601
Meng Shangshi has orders

315
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,840
Please come with me, girl

316
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,241
Is this cold

317
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:34,601
Sure enough

318
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,161
Melt at the entrance

319
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:39,881
This chicken piece is still very white and delicious

320
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:42,281
Cook chicken in light vinegar in advance

321
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,601
To be so fragrant and tender

322
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,281
What's the use of this copper coin

323
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:10,960
Miaomiaomiao

324
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,720
Antler vegetables with porridge have excellent flavor

325
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,200
Please taste it, Your Majesty

326
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,761
Common practices of mandarin fish porridge are not common

327
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,960
Brother, this is really interesting

328
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,761
It's just a round monk porridge in Yi Jianzhi

329
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:44,560
Read a few idle books

330
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,161
Dare to show off before the command

331
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:47,320
That's interesting

332
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,560
If you love reading, you are an elegant chef

333
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Brother, you are so strange today

334
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,161
See nothing pleasing to the eye

335
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:56,761
How on earth did this kitchen offend you

336
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:58,040
Do I have

337
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,440
You're wrong

338
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,641
What did Hu Shangshi tell you to do

339
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,641
What are you talking about

340
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,281
Meng Shangshi didn't tell me to lead you there

341
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,560
Meng Shang Shi

342
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:29,840
Serving the emperor for dinner

343
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,401
Those who come to send messages must be the command's people

344
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,080
You see

345
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,920
Your boots are covered with mud

346
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,920
It is also worthy to serve in front of the emperor

347
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:42,200
Somebody come

348
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,001
Somebody, there's an assassin

349
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:51,761
Somebody, please

350
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:37,800
There is another person

351
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:39,121
There are moles under the eyebrows

352
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,200
Short in stature

353
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,521
It's going that way

354
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:44,920
Don't chase it yet

355
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:45,800
Yes

356
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,641
What did I say

357
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,080
How can you back down

358
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,281
People still can't tolerate you

359
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,200
Don't you come now

360
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,481
Thank you, Lord You

361
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,641
How

362
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,481
Blood

363
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,361
The more you rub, how can you meet people

364
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,720
And now

365
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,320
Can you still see it

366
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:13,440
Don't you go soon

367
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:33,320
What's the matter, Xiao Shi

368
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,001
Let me check

369
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,241
And move me to see

370
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,361
What's going on

371
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:43,680
Xiao Shi

372
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:46,481
Ayan

373
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:46,960
Xiao Shi

374
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,440
Don't come over. Get out of the way

375
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,361
Ayan

376
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:50,761
Xiao Shi

377
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,560
You get up

378
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,320
Your Highness

379
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:54,440
A-a-a-a-a

380
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,121
Ah, ah

381
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,440
Ayan

382
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,080
Go to Xuan Tai Yi quickly

383
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,121
Yes

384
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,641
Ayan

385
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:11,320
Blockade Xiyuan and prohibit anyone from entering or leaving

386
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,761
Yes

387
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,800
Is there anything unusual before King Wei goes out

388
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
No, no, no

389
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,281
Your Highness was just fine

390
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:22,320
What's wrong with this

391
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:23,881
It's antler

392
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:26,720
Your Majesty, it must be the antler

393
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:30,920
Who allows you to talk nonsense

394
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:32,761
Antler grows in Shan Ye

395
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,560
It is inevitable to be contaminated with snake venom

396
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,001
Mung bean soup must be scalded before eating

397
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:38,960
Now His Royal Highness King Wei is poisoned

398
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,641
I'm afraid they have neglected this

399
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,921
Your Majesty is careful in cooking

400
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:46,520
There would never be such a big mistake

401
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,681
Or please ask the Imperial Doctor to treat His Royal Highness Wei Wang quickly

402
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,961
All the kitchens involved will be won

403
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,840
Who cooked the antler today

404
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:05,480
They

405
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,121
What happened

406
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,000
Take away

407
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,601
Why are you arresting people for no reason

408
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,240
What are you doing

409
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,760
Go, go, go

410
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,800
What did I do

411
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,361
Let go

412
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:16,121
Let go of me

413
00:35:16,121 --> 00:35:16,520
Cut the crap

414
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,080
What the hell have we done

415
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,280
Let go of me

416
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,080
What's going on here

417
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:36,201
Quickly

418
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,601
Sister

419
00:35:39,401 --> 00:35:40,881
You can't go. You can't go

420
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,681
What the hell happened

421
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:01,280
Hu Shang Shi

422
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Events of the Day

423
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,201
Hu Shang Shi

424
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,961
Fresh antler from here

425
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,320
They were all scalded with mung bean soup

426
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,721
Meng Shangshi and Ziping were wronged

427
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,361
I have narrowly escaped death

428
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,201
There is still time to care about other people's lives and deaths

429
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,800
You are really an extraordinary person

430
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,480
The feud between you and me

431
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:24,240
After all, it has nothing to do with business

432
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,040
Meng Shangshi and others were imprisoned

433
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,641
The Food Bureau must have lost its reputation

434
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,681
The errand of entering imperial food

435
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:32,240
It must be taken by the food supervisor

436
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:34,881
Then what good will it do to you

437
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,121
Meng Shang has no way to eat

438
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,361
This makes a big mistake

439
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,121
When I officially take over in the future,

440
00:36:40,721 --> 00:36:42,201
Will regain the right to eat

441
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,681
You don't need a little palm meal

442
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,080
Royal Guards

443
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,201
Not from the rest of the antler

444
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:49,560
Find out any problems

445
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,800
How can you be so sure

446
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,921
Snakes and insects crawl through venom residues

447
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,520
Who can guarantee the dish that King Wei took

448
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,480
No problem

449
00:36:58,641 --> 00:36:59,280
Moon flower

450
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:02,121
You've been in the kitchen the whole time

451
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:03,921
You should see it with your own eyes

452
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:05,560
All the antler vegetables

453
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,240
They are all cleared with mung bean water

454
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:14,760
I didn't see anything

455
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:15,840
Moon flower

456
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:17,840
On the menu of that dish

457
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:19,560
Only Yin Ziping and Fang Hanying

458
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,881
Let you get away with it

459
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:23,240
But don't forget

460
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,560
There will be no Meng Shang to protect you in the future

461
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,320
If you come to provoke regardless of honor or inferiority,

462
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:30,320
Hugh blames me for being ruthless

463
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,280
Moon flower

464
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,881
I can win by strength

465
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,760
Why bother to make trouble

466
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,840
You don't think

467
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,961
Am I the one who tampered with the antler

468
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,641
It was their own negligence

469
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,040
I ran into the emperor's favorite youngest son

470
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,320
It's a day to die of her

471
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:09,760
If the doctor diagnosed

472
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,961
Is it true that King Wei's illness has nothing to do with them

473
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,320
Wei Wang suddenly fell into a coma after eating

474
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:16,240
How did they get away with it

475
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:19,520
Yuehua, you should know

476
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,201
This matter is not man-made

477
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,520
Everything is God's will

478
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,480
What we've done

479
00:38:25,161 --> 00:38:26,961
It's nothing more than standing by and watching

480
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,961
Do you understand

481
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,080
Yes

482
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,800
Imperial concubine empress

483
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:33,921
Wei Wang's disease

484
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:35,520
Wearing a court sentence

485
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,800
Everyone in the palace knows it

486
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,080
My son was in good health before he went to the garden

487
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,961
He ate poisonous antler

488
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,760
Empress, this minister also dare not make an assertion

489
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:49,240
This is not the time to investigate the cause

490
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:50,681
The most important thing is

491
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,161
Is to cure Wei Wang's illness

492
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:19,760
Sister Yao

493
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,320
Evergreen

494
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:23,601
I've asked someone I know

495
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,320
Wei Wang is seriously ill with high fever

496
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,921
His Majesty himself prayed for him

497
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,280
Waiting all night again

498
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:32,161
It's just that the doctor can't find out the cause

499
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Meng Shang's food is afraid of being in danger

500
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,601
Don't wait

501
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:41,520
I want to see the Imperial Concubine

502
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:44,401
I really have something to say

503
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,441
Now Wei Wang is seriously ill

504
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,401
The imperial concubine is angry with Meng Shangshi

505
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,320
Don't say you can't see it

506
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,601
Even if you saw it,

507
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:55,681
I'm afraid I have to fold myself in

508
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:56,520
Evergreen

509
00:39:57,921 --> 00:39:58,681
Then you tell me

510
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,520
What kind of symptoms do Wei Wang have

511
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,681
How could I know that

512
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,921
Let's go

513
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,201
It's not just Meng Shang who eats them

514
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:08,401
There is also Guanglu Temple in Shanglinyuan

515
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,520
Anyone involved in this matter will be implicated

516
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,201
I can't take care of it

517
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,161
You have been waiting here for two hours

518
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:16,921
You have done your utmost

519
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:18,161
Go home

520
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,681
Let's go

521
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:22,201
Evergreen

522
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,121
Let's go

523
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,361
Your Majesty

524
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,560
Although your highness has taken the poison-clearing decoction,

525
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:49,480
But he is too young

526
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:51,520
Now the head and face are swollen

527
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,840
Pulse floating number

528
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,520
I'm afraid I can't stand it

529
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:00,080
Your Majesty

530
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,840
Coco, on his back

531
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,641
Toxic backlog in lungs

532
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,080
There is redness, swelling and heat pain

533
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:10,000
Your Majesty Ayan is the most like you

534
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,361
Usually sickly

535
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,520
How do you think he can stand the pain

536
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:18,401
I want to spend it safely this time

537
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:21,240
I really can only ask God for mercy

538
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,441
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, is worried about King Wei's illness

539
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,721
Please see again and again

540
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,520
See, see, let him go back

541
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:33,641
Yes

542
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,681
Your Majesty, you said Ayan is good

543
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:40,840
How can you suddenly be poisoned

544
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,921
Someone must have a grudge against male and female servants and concubines

545
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,681
Deliberately wanted Ayan's life

546
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,520
His Royal Highness the Prince

547
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,000
Your Majesty said please ask your Royal Highness to go back first

548
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,361
When Wei Wang's illness has improved,

549
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,401
Again

550
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,961
Let's go, Chen Wu

551
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:18,961
Prince Boxing Heart

552
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,401
Please transmit it to your majesty

553
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:52,961
Quickly

554
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:53,921
Go to report Hu Shangshi

555
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,760
Yes

556
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:25,681
Empress Empress

557
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:30,641
There is still a grievance in the Food Bureau

558
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:32,201
To play in person

559
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:34,480
How dare you

560
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:35,721
How dare you stop the Queen's ceremonial ceremony

561
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:36,480
Don't retreat yet

562
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,961
Empress still has grievances in the Food Bureau

563
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:42,401
Please ask the Empress to redress her grievances

564
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:44,601
Somebody drag her down

565
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,401
Empress

566
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,921
Emperor Taizu set up drums outside the Wumen Gate

567
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,520
Allow the wrongdoers in the world to complain to the holy man

568
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,721
Empress Xiaoci and Empress Renxiao followed the example of the imperial court

569
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,161
Open up a wide range of ways to rehabilitate grievances in the harem

570
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,161
But now the grievance is in front of the empress

571
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:00,560
How can the empress sit idly by

572
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Don't stop her mouth yet

573
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,721
Empress Empress

574
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,560
Wait a minute

575
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:12,401
Handmaidservant. See Synonyms at Empress

576
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:18,320
Monteggia made a big mistake by omission

577
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,320
You're still here to redress her grievances

578
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:21,280
Take away

579
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,201
Hu Shang Shi

580
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,520
Can you assert in front of the empress

581
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,361
There is really no grievance

582
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:28,881
Why can't I argue

583
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,240
Don't take it away yet

584
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,320
Hu Shang Shi

585
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:34,441
Empress Empress

586
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,121
Don't listen to this woman's gossip to confuse people

587
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,681
She is a Monteggia henchman

588
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:39,401
Will do everything possible to excuse her

589
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,840
The handmaiden will send her to Miyagi

590
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,881
Make an example of others

591
00:45:43,161 --> 00:45:44,641
She mentioned Queen Filial Piety just now

592
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,601
Empress Ren Xiao

593
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:47,480
If you don't listen to her redress

594
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,681
But I am heartless and unkind

595
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,840
Emperor Taizu, the empress, has long said clearly

596
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,840
Only those who have great grievances and confidential feelings can shout grievances

597
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:58,961
There are still people in the harem who deliberately falsely accuse

598
00:45:58,961 --> 00:45:59,800
Involve innocent people

599
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:01,441
How can her words be accepted

600
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:04,480
Besides, this person shouted in front of the temple and collided with the phoenix driver

601
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,921
Violate palace rules

602
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,080
Collision Phoenix Drive

603
00:46:07,961 --> 00:46:08,961
Handmaiden is willing to receive punishment

604
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:10,721
Just ask the Empress to redress her grievances

605
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,401
You have to think it over

606
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,040
If you go back on your word when you are punished

607
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,361
It will be punished as causing trouble for no reason

608
00:46:15,921 --> 00:46:16,800
By that time

609
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,921
I will send you to Gongzhengsi for a higher punishment

610
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,601
Ask the Empress to fulfill it

611
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:21,800
Empress

612
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,800
Good

613
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,601
I help you
