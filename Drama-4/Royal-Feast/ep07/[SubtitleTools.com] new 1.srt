1
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,281
Let's tear down the door later

2
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:56,921
Anyway, closing the door is useless

3
00:19:57,681 --> 00:19:58,161
Yes

4
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,440
Lord You

5
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:03,401
Is this coming back to search for the palace maidservant who took the title again

6
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:04,921
Yu's confession

7
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,921
The Prince had ordered her to poison His Majesty's diet

8
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,840
Guanglu Temple Food Bureau is also involved

9
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,921
Meng Shang Shi

10
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:13,401
I'm sorry

11
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,801
According to Daming Law

12
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:15,641
Conviction of officials

13
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,360
A formal trial is required to finalize the case

14
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,881
I respectfully ask the Holy Judgment

15
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,041
Inside the harem

16
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,440
Gong Zhengsi is in charge of picketing the Imperial Palace

17
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,041
Today, I am the female official of Zhengwupin Imperial Palace

18
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,681
Even if you want to interrogate and detain

19
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:29,041
Should be detained in Gongzhengsi

20
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,360
Instead of Zhenfu Prison

21
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:32,401
Why bother the Royal Guards

22
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,240
This kind of case can't be tried by Gong Zhengsi

23
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:37,041
Had to wronged Meng Shang to eat

24
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:38,801
Take away

25
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:39,561
Wait a minute

26
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:45,761
The sinner Yu Shi is the one who denounced me

27
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,360
Or the whole food bureau

28
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,921
It is natural that no one knows if they want to go against each other

29
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,960
Good

30
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:56,161
Since it's just me

31
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,840
Just imprison and interrogate me

32
00:20:58,281 --> 00:20:59,001
Meng Shang Shi

33
00:20:59,401 --> 00:20:59,921
Your Excellency

34
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,281
Nayu's family

35
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,440
Openly arguing with Guo Bianfei at the flower banquet

36
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,281
May be holding a grudge for a long time

37
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,521
Do not hesitate to frame the prince

38
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:10,440
Involve the whole food bureau

39
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,681
Please also learn from you that you should not be blinded by Yu's family

40
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,001
When will it be your turn to speak

41
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:21,521
Lord You

42
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,001
Shang Shi Bureau is in charge of court meals

43
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,840
It is the most important place in the palace

44
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:27,120
If you want to be detained,

45
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:28,360
Why don't you detain me?

46
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:29,681
Let Meng Shang eat first

47
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:31,401
I'm also the duty

48
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Dare not neglect and indulge

49
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,561
I have to wronged three people

50
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,921
Take away

51
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:40,521
Rest assured

52
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,881
You have no real evidence at all

53
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,440
How can you take people away easily

54
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,041
Just because of a sinner's words

55
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:46,801
As of today

56
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,401
Present noble people's meals

57
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,001
Have to go through careful interrogation

58
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:51,561
If there is a flaw

59
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,001
It's not Masahiro Miyagi waiting for you

60
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,001
It's Zhenfu's prison

61
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:58,720
Trust me

62
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,720
You don't want to know

63
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,041
What kind of a place is that

64
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:05,720
Zi Jin

65
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
What shall we do

66
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,080
I haven't sent anything to Zhuang Fei for three days

67
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
They guard like this

68
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,600
We can't get out at all

69
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,281
I still have to think of another way

70
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:14,681
Don't be rash

71
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,801
Quickly

72
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,281
This

73
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,440
Have something to eat

74
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Even if you have to keep it

75
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,360
You can't stay water and rice all day, can you

76
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:00,281
Please

77
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,681
Come here

78
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:06,761
Walk over

79
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,041
Come

80
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,440
So fragrant

81
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:13,320
Come

82
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,521
Come on, give it to me, give it to me

83
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:15,921
Come

84
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,681
Empress Zhuang Fei

85
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:09,801
Empress Zhuang Fei

86
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,600
Take down

87
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,120
How come every time I see you

88
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,200
Make me say the same thing

89
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:35,521
Take away

90
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:08,440
Your Excellency

91
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,120
It's just a little palace maid

92
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:11,401
Can't stand the scare

93
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,200
Take her for a walk in prison

94
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:16,401
Tomorrow's confession is all ready

95
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,720
Is it

96
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,641
She can say whatever she wants her to say

97
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,521
Keep it verbatim

98
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,840
Your Majesty

99
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,840
The palace maid of Shangshi Bureau has confessed

100
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,080
Princess Zhuang was imprisoned after the incident

101
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,960
Meng Shangshi disobeyed the imperial edict

102
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,480
Private palace maidservants deliver meals

103
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,440
It can be seen that Yu's Zhuang Fei

104
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,001
There is indeed collusion between the Food Bureau

105
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,240
Just take what you said to me

106
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:11,120
Yu and others conspired against each other

107
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:12,600
When and where to poison

108
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,281
Say it one by one

109
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,881
Lord You

110
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,281
Don't inflict heavy punishment on me

111
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:20,001
What does your Lord ask the handmaiden to say

112
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,161
Handmaidens are willing to confess

113
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,600
Father, did you hear me

114
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,761
The Royal Guards used heavy punishment to persecute innocent people

115
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,401
My son is really wronged

116
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:35,761
This is the command

117
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:37,681
How dare you talk nonsense

118
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,281
Tell the truth

119
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,921
Lord You

120
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:49,480
He insisted

121
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,440
Don't say we were plotting to poison

122
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,041
I just haven't had time to do it yet

123
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,200
It coincides with Yu Niangniang's bedtime

124
00:28:57,921 --> 00:28:59,281
This is the opportunity to set fire

125
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,960
Yu Niangniang

126
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,881
The handmaiden didn't say anything

127
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,440
Didn't say anything about your illness

128
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,161
The handmaiden really didn't say anything

129
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,801
Yu Niangniang

130
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:12,921
Handmaiden handmaiden didn't say anything

131
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:16,240
Your Majesty

132
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,320
Yu Shi, she obviously harbored evil intentions

133
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,320
What's the disease

134
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
A palace maid who is still in the food bureau

135
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,281
How did you know about it

136
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,161
Handmaiden

137
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,960
Handmaiden

138
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:33,281
Shake what

139
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,440
What do you want to say clearly

140
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:36,761
Your Majesty makes decisions for you

141
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,440
Yes yes

142
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,320
The handmaiden thought

143
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,921
Recently

144
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
Yu Niangniang's food list has changed greatly

145
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,041
There are often palace maidservants taking honey and candied fruit

146
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,001
The palace people talked privately

147
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:57,240
They said that Yu Niangniang was strangely ill

148
00:29:58,881 --> 00:29:59,440
Your Majesty

149
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,600
The handmaiden has just entered the palace

150
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,600
I don't even know the way to the palace

151
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,521
Lord You insisted on taking away the handmaiden

152
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:07,521
Ask what conspiracy

153
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,561
Handmaiden really doesn't know anything

154
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,840
Your Majesty, forgive your life. Your Majesty, forgive your life

155
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:13,521
Father

156
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,080
My son is really wronged

157
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,120
Your Majesty

158
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:25,120
I asked the Imperial Doctor to treat Yu in court

159
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:31,600
An audience with Imperial Doctor Xuan Sheng

160
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,281
What's the use of checking

161
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:38,761
Why not tell you

162
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:43,360
The prince wants to kill your majesty

163
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,600
Because he's tired of waiting

164
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Can't wait to be emperor

165
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,120
I

166
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,600
Be left out for many years

167
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:01,120
Suffering from the slow treatment and bullying of the whole palace

168
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,001
I'm tired of living

169
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,120
Yu's

170
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,960
Your Majesty doesn't often see you

171
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,360
But treat you well

172
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,720
How can there be so much resentment

173
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,960
How can you be so vicious

174
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,120
Want to bury all of us with you

175
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,600
Princess Zhuang

176
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Do you think your Majesty really dotes on you

177
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,921
We're just royal thrushes

178
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:27,521
Oriole

179
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,320
They will be released one day

180
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,080
But we

181
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:37,480
You can only boil until you grow old

182
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:39,561
Drop to tooth drop

183
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,041
Your Majesty

184
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
Your Majesty

185
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,600
Since I didn't mean it,

186
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,401
Why did you hurt my life, sire

187
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,600
Crazy woman

188
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,281
Chen Shengyin visits Your Majesty

189
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:08,881
Sheng Tai Yi

190
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,840
Please feel Yu's pulse

191
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,881
Yes

192
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:25,320
Check what to judge what

193
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,001
What's there to check

194
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,561
This pulse

195
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,521
This pulse is soft on the left

196
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:43,281
Right inch off

197
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:44,360
What exactly is the disease

198
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,401
From the pulse condition,

199
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,881
The patient has chest obstruction and heartache for more than three years

200
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,240
Nowadays, the medicine stone is ineffective

201
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,641
Time is running out

202
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,561
As for eating candied fruit

203
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:59,561
It must be heart failure and bitter taste

204
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,480
Your Majesty

205
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,921
You can kill me

206
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,401
Your Majesty, I beg you

207
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,681
You can kill me

208
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:06,320
Your Majesty

209
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,320
Your Majesty, you heard it with your own ears

210
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,600
Yu Shi, she has lost all hope

211
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:15,561
Holding the mind of dying with everyone

212
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,881
Male and female servants and others are wronged

213
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:19,161
Your Majesty's Sage

214
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:21,761
Return the innocence of male and female servants and concubines

215
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:23,641
Father

216
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,200
Such a terminally ill woman

217
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Crazy talk, crazy talk

218
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,561
Is it trustworthy

219
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,521
Even if my son finds someone to coordinate

220
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,281
How can you find such a precarious person

221
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,360
Is my son in the eyes of my father

222
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,041
Is it really a fool who is wanton and frivolous

223
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,921
Father

224
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,881
Who gave you the courage to frame the prince

225
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:52,600
Say

226
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:57,641
I can't let you bury me

227
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,080
What a pity

228
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,080
Prince Ye

229
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,320
Don't blame me

230
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,681
Blame your good side princess

231
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:10,121
She openly bullied

232
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,001
I'm a poor man

233
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:14,240
I have to come to settle accounts with you

234
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,321
As long as your East House falls

235
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,761
What vengeance do I have that I can't avenge

236
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,041
The more people I have on the road, the better

237
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,480
Yu Shi, you still refuse to tell the truth

238
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:38,001
Grandpa Emperor

239
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,561
A few days ago

240
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,160
Someone sent an altar of gold to Yu's home

241
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,400
And promised to take care of her parents for life

242
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,761
Yu knows that his life will not be long

243
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,200
He promised to deliberately set fire to the prince

244
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,720
Nowadays, witness and physical evidence

245
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,521
The eunuchs who spread the news inside and outside are waiting for the decree outside the temple

246
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:56,680
Who is the mastermind

247
00:34:58,081 --> 00:34:59,601
What do you say, Uncle

248
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:05,041
Zhu Zhanji

249
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,761
What have I got to do with this

250
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,521
Grandpa Emperor

251
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:09,960
After inquiry

252
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,001
Someone recognized

253
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,200
The one who sent the gold was the chief attendant of Han Wangfu

254
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,160
Fracture

255
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,200
This is a naked structure

256
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,960
Father

257
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,321
I have never seen this woman before

258
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,121
I didn't send any gold to Yu's family

259
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,121
Father, you have to believe me

260
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,801
If I want to frame the prince,

261
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:31,640
Be sure to go unnoticed

262
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,480
How can people claim to be people in Han Wangfu

263
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:36,440
Isn't this waiting to be exposed

264
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,601
Someone must have framed the prince

265
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,880
I want to alienate our royal flesh and blood again

266
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:44,761
Father Ming Jian, father

267
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,521
Don't worry, uncle

268
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,920
Say it slowly if you have grievances

269
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,880
Can I not be in a hurry

270
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,720
Who can not be framed in a hurry

271
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,880
My son is really wronged

272
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,281
Father Ming Jian

273
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,521
Second uncle, don't make a gaffe in front of the temple

274
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:03,001
Zhanji, you believe in your uncle, don't you

275
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:05,160
Tell Grandpa Huang quickly

276
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,801
Second uncle is wronged

277
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:08,801
Wronged

278
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,720
That's enough

279
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,121
Send Princess Zhuang back to the palace first

280
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,400
Yu's prison will be retried in the future

281
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:22,761
Yes

282
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,920
Your Majesty still thinks the food bureau is innocent

283
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,521
Let it go together

284
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,801
Father Emperor Father Emperor

285
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:36,281
You believe me, don't you

286
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:37,400
Big Brother

287
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:42,801
The third child

288
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,761
The third child

289
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:55,920
Please stay, Lord You

290
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,321
What do you want from Your Highness

291
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,081
Lord You

292
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,400
Do you ever think

293
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,041
What's so weird about this thing

294
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:07,880
This is not a conspiracy at all

295
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,761
Yu's life will not be long

296
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,841
And resent the rudeness of the Eastern Palace concubine

297
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:13,361
Want to burn everything

298
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,720
Will frame the prince

299
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,720
Involve innocent people

300
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,801
As for what to do with Hanwang

301
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:19,680
Since your majesty has not made a clear decree,

302
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,281
Nature can't be investigated

303
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Please forgive my grandson

304
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:24,440
How do I feel

305
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:26,400
Witness and material evidence

306
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,680
It's like everything is waiting for me

307
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,680
As long as the truth comes out

308
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:33,001
It is good that the prince is safe

309
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,200
His Royal Highness Taisun, Wei Chen, retired

310
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,841
Empress watch your step

311
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:53,920
Thank you for just

312
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,480
Let's go

313
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:15,761
Why are you following me

314
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,680
Fuck off

315
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,121
Fuck off

316
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,200
Han Wang is so furious

317
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:27,640
What's the use

318
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:30,920
Release comes quickly

319
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,801
Look at you like this

320
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,801
It seems to have suffered a great injustice

321
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,400
How

322
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:40,640
Even you think I bought Yu's

323
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,521
Frame Prince

324
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,761
Isn't it

325
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,200
Buy off a terminally ill woman

326
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
To assassinate the father

327
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,361
Frame Prince

328
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,200
But also leave witness and physical evidence

329
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,920
In your heart

330
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,960
Am I so stupid

331
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:56,841
In this way

332
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,121
It's like someone deliberately alienated

333
00:38:59,761 --> 00:39:00,720
Not Zhu Gaochi

334
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,841
It won't be Zhu Zhanji

335
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:03,960
Why

336
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,321
My eldest brother reads the book of sages

337
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:09,321
Believe in the art of leniency and saint

338
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,521
He can't do such a thing

339
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:12,761
As for the boy Zhu Zhanji,

340
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,960
More shrewd than Big Brother

341
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,200
How could you try to frame me

342
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,960
What about bringing trouble to your biological father

343
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:23,160
That is, someone deliberately led him to verify

344
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,801
Who could this man be

345
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:44,480
Pay tribute

346
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,920
Inverse

347
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:54,041
If it were you

348
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:57,240
Pass by many times

349
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,761
His Royal Highness Han Wang didn't recognize his own son

350
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:00,960
How

351
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:02,640
I recognize it now

352
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:03,880
See this tombstone

353
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
What else can't I guess

354
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:07,720
Take a closer look at you

355
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,281
Not born like me at all

356
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,200
It's more like that bitch

357
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:18,880
Sovereign, Sovereign, calm down

358
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,720
Sovereign

359
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:20,601
Bitch

360
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:23,960
King Wang Ye

361
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:25,081
Bitch

362
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:30,041
Mother

363
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,880
After your mother died

364
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,801
You sneaked out of the palace

365
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:35,801
I sent people to find nothing

366
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,281
For so many years

367
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,440
Your appearance and temperament have changed greatly

368
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,521
When I first saw you,

369
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:43,720
Or will you have doubts

370
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:45,480
It seems that seven years ago

371
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:48,281
The body in Jinan looks like you

372
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,640
It's also the maze of your cloth

373
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,200
The emperor went out in distress

374
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
You have been meritorious in rescuing the driver

375
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,640
Since then, he has been transferred to Beijing

376
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:00,521
Go all the way to the top

377
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,761
But how strict is the selection of Royal Guards

378
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,200
Did the emperor know for a long time

379
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,321
A maid gives birth to a child

380
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,321
Never got an audience with the emperor's grandfather

381
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,160
Who will know who I am

382
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,761
Then neither should you

383
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,880
For a woman who disobeys her husband

384
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,281
Designing to frame one's biological father

385
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,960
Now you know what it's like to be wronged

386
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:24,761
My mother was innocently wronged and had an affair with others

387
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,001
I don't even have a chance to defend myself

388
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,601
She is more wronged than you

389
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,841
A hundred times more painful than you

390
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:53,281
Bastard

391
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,041
You can really ignore your father

392
00:41:58,801 --> 00:41:59,601
Don't forget

393
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,160
The blood on you is mine

394
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:04,361
Is it

395
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,160
You don't listen to rumors

396
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,720
Confessed that my mother had an affair with someone

397
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:11,640
Maybe

398
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,561
I'm a bastard, too

399
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,281
After the death of Zheng

400
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:20,240
I once regretted it

401
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,601
It was too rash at first

402
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,640
I sent people everywhere looking for you

403
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,361
I searched all over the country

404
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:27,841
You hate me

405
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:29,561
I don't blame you

406
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,680
You have been very intelligent since you were a child

407
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:36,640
Has always been my father's favorite child

408
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:39,400
If it weren't for hindering etiquette

409
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,680
You should have been the son of my Han Wangfu

410
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:18,920
Pay tribute

411
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:24,920
If you don't want to go back with me,

412
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,281
I don't force it either

413
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,121
I hope one day

414
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,041
Can you call me Father yourself

415
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,801
Go ahead

416
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:49,720
I have something to interrogate alone

417
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,801
What I promised you has been done

418
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:01,841
What about what you promised me

419
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,200
Your younger siblings who were kicked out by your stepmother

420
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:14,081
I have asked someone to find it

421
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:16,361
And foster care in a family

422
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,001
They will grow up healthy and safe

423
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,480
As for the wolf-hearted man and woman

424
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,200
Will accompany you on the road naturally

425
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:32,321
I'm relieved

426
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,361
One more thing I don't understand

427
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:37,561
Say

428
00:44:39,521 --> 00:44:40,920
You used me

429
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,801
Design and frame Hanwang

430
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:46,680
What is the intention?

431
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:49,440
Nature is

432
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:52,801
Back to my beloved father
