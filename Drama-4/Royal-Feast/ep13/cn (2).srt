00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:45,519

4
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,319
go out

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,599
father

6
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,039
why are you laughing

7
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
Grandpa, you don't have to waste time

8
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,160
You asked Mr. Xia to accompany me to visit the countryside

9
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,919
Understand the suffering of the people

10
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:27,639
Master Xia always makes me eat glutinous rice

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,639
I have hated it for a long time

12
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,639
So I sent people to investigate secretly

13
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,919
looking for evidence of his crime

14
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,240
But the man I sent came back and told me

15
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:40,479
Lord Xia only has cloth and pottery in his house

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,119
nothing else

17
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,800
In fact, it's just a trivial matter whether Xia Yuanji kills or not.

18
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,199
That

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
what's the big deal

20
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,960
grandfather

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,279
You've been sick twice

22
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,759
grandson wish you long live

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,240
Let your grandson go on your behalf for the Northern Expedition this time.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,160
OK

25
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,399
One hundred years of life

26
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,080
The world has many

27
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
all gone

28
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
unknown

29
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,320
Yan Hui thirty

30
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,119
Famous for generations to come

31
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,360
I want to create eternal merits

32
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,320
Why should one hundred years of life

33
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,919
But you can't go

34
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,479
grandfather

35
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,119
I don't worry about Beizheng

36
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,039
because you stayed in Beijing

37
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,720
I can't take risks with Daming's future

38
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,200
Arutai

39
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,320
every year

40
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,359
The people are suffering

41
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,399
I always think about it

42
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
biting

43
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,079
They scold me for being so overjoyed

44
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,679
by him

45
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,079
scolding me

46
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,160
also by him

47
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:52,880
I

48
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,959
Even if the infamy left behind

49
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,959
Never allow an inch of Daming's land to be trampled on

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,480
Not to allow the people of Ming Dynasty to be displaced

51
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,480
child

52
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Your father has read a lot of sage books.

53
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,079
Being fooled by a bunch of bookworms

54
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
since you think

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,079
That old thing from the Ministry is still useful

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,839
I'll leave it to you

57
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:35,760
grandfather

58
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
You have been on the throne for more than 20 years

59
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,160
All over the morning

60
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,000
Ask the dynasties

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,559
With the respect of the Son of Heaven

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Conquer the desert

63
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,320
how many people

64
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,239
your heart and vision

65
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,600
How can it be known by the swallows under the gallery

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,239
There are few eagles in this world

67
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,959
How many short-sighted chaffinches

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
wear thousands of times

69
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
It's just flattery

70
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,160
What other good words

Waiting for the grandfather to win

77
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,799
Let's go hunting

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,559

85
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,600
Daming army arrives at Dalanamur River

86
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,799
Arutai fled after hearing the wind

87
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,679
The Ming army searched the valley for 300 miles and found nothing

88
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,000
Insufficient food and grass in the army

89
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,839
Zhu Di ordered the class teacher

90
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,160

don't you have anything to say to me?

98

The slaves are frightened

99
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,760
There's no fear in your face

100
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,320
I will go back to Beijing in March

101
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,760
Met with the grandfather and left in a hurry

102
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,440
May 归 kyo stop three days

103
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,239
I deliberately didn't call you

104
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,000

But where did your old man go?

never renege on others

172
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,159

Concubine Zhuang has served the late emperor for a long time

Better to send her on the road

196
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,039
go

197
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,559
Yes

198
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,440
you can't go in

199
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Queen is alive

200
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,840
Be extra kind to Concubine Zhuang

201
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,400
Moreover

202
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,679
Concubines and concubines have to eat before they go on the road

203
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,400
Why are you two making it difficult for Concubine Zhuang?

204
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,679
Concubine Zhuang

205
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,400
This is the walnut cheese you mentioned many times before

206
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,599
you try

207
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Does it taste the same as before?

208
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,799
Different

209
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,599
Walnut cheese made with my mother

210
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,960
Different

211
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,559
Help

212
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,039
I beg you again to help me

213
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,599
Concubine Zhuang

214
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,440
you get up

215
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,599
You took care of us many times in the past

216
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,960
But we are just the little maids of Shangshi Bureau

217
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
Burial is ancestral

218
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,520
how can we help

219
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,880
Deadline for Burial

220
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
after sunset today

221
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
you help me out of the palace

222
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,599
help me out

223
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:52,919
Concubine Zhuang

224
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:53,760
you

225
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,719
The queen refuses to see us

226
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,840
I can't beg her

227
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,599
I'm not I'm not running away

228
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,359
I just want to see my mother

229
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,079
she has no son

230
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,000
no one to rely on

231
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,599
i don't ask for anything else

232
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,479
I just need to see her once

233
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,439
even if

234
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,319
Say your last goodbye

235
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,839
I just say goodbye and come back

236
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,520
I beg you to help me

237
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
I beg you to help me

238
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,839
please

239
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,560
I just say a word and I'll be back

240
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,920
I

241
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,160
I just want to see my mother one last time

242
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,239
even such a request

243
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,359
Can't satisfy me

244
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,160
you want to leave the palace

245
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,439
Concubine Zhuang

246
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,040
There are only three now

247
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,359
If you don't come back before sunset

248
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,239
The three of us will lose our lives

249
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,760
You have a way to get me out of the palace

250
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,520
Great

251
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,319
I swear

252
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,239
I will definitely be back

253
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,160
I swear I'll be back

254
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,239
before sunset

255
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
Yao Zijin

256
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,599
know i'm dying

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,680
Take this kind of thing to perfunctory me

258
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,719
roll

259
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,959
all roll

260
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,199
get out

261
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,079
roll

262
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:50,839
empress

263
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,520
go out

264
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
What are you doing, madam

265
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,479
Niang Niang calm down

266
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,239
Niang Niang calm down

267
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,000
Slave, this is redone and sent

268
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,479
Today is every Thursday

269
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,719
Outside Xuanwu Gate was supposed to open an inner city

270
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,760
You can go out with a badge

271
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,959
But the market went on strike during the funeral

272
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,359
In and out

273
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,359
Most of them are people who go to various supervisors and bureaus to do errands.

274
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,719
Go all the way across the long street

275
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,160
Encounter with patrol guards

276
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,599
Show them the badge

277
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:35,839
just say

278
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,800
The number of grains and sauces sent by the wine and vinegar noodle bureau is wrong

279
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,239
Hu Shangshi sent you to ask

280
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,439
Next

281
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,280
waist card

282
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,599
what are you doing

283
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,719
queuing

284
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,520
Obviously I came first

285
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
what's wrong with me standing in front

286
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,959
Are you unreasonable?

287
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,599
do you know where this is

288
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
wanton noise

289
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,079
hurry up

290
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:03,959
take away

291
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,560
let's go

292
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,000
go

293
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,839
not her first

294
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,359
go

295
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,359
out of Xuanwumen

296
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,839
The really sad one is at Bei'anmen

297
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,520
You are so kind girl

298
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
a dying man

299
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,400
Really redo it and send it

300
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,160
the dying man

301
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,239
Why bother with her

302
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,359
I am full

303
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,719
You'll be on your way soon.

304
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,479
go in

305
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,040
why

306
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,280
Yes

307
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,520
why

308
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,560
I used to help her and it was profitable

309
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,880
But now she's about to die

310
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,520
is a useless person

311
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,719
Why are you

312
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:11,400
To take such a big risk to help her

313
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,959
what are you looking at me

314
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,239
am i wrong?

315
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,880
Obviously follow the steps that Concubine Zhuang said

316
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
to make walnut cheese

317
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,119
why the taste is different

318
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,199
people are dying

319
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,680
What's the difference?

320
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:34,920
Okay

321
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,040
even if you say

322
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,199
She got out of Xuanwumen successfully

323
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,479
But how did she get out of Bei'anmen?

324
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,160
I heard that there are eighteen red shops there

325
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,520
Hundreds of guards

326
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,079
There is no escape from the wings

327
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Zijin

328
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,599
Let's go get the man back now

329
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,880
also atonement

330
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,839
How
free at kisskh.me


331
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,000
Zijin

332
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:01,800
Zijin

333
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Is it the problem with these walnuts?

334
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,760
Yao Zijin

335
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,000
Only you will believe her

336
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,880
If it were me

337
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,079
a chance to escape

338
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm not going away right now

339
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
The lady will be back

340
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,280
She never broke her promise

341
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,400
in the face of death threats

342
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,880
Anyone can become selfish and cowardly

343
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,040
no exception

344
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,280
Obviously you don't have to come in to deliver the meal

345
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,199
Then why come?

346
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:30,839
not afraid of death

347
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,560
You will be afraid by yourself

348
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:37,839
Ziping

349
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,719
will be back

350
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,479
I knew it

351
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,719
Who will take the initiative to come back to die?

352
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,239
fraud

353
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,520
Yao Zijin

354
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,119
you fool

355
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,719
go

356
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:17,880
hurry up hurry up

357
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,079
hurry up

358
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,359
And Concubine Zhuang, the head of Yongning Palace

359
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,439
go fast

360
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Yao girl

361
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,400
palm lamp

362
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,599
they'll be there soon

363
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:44,959
quick

364
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:45,839
just ahead

365
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,239
Don't waste time

366
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:47,640
Yes

367
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,359
you go

368
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,640
you go now

369
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,760
Ziping

370
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,199
You don't have to worry about implicated others in Yongning Palace

371
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,119
I stayed

372
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
why do you say that

373
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,959
I should have been dead

374
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,000
I'll give you my life this time

375
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,280
You and I will never owe each other

376
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,239
what does this mean

377
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,520
The night our family died

378
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,160
I'm the only one who escaped

379
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,280
Do you think

380
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,239
The person who opened the cricket jar

381
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,160
Is it really my brother?

382
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,280
Now know that you send kindhearted people

383
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,839
What kind of monster is it?

384
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,599
you go away

385
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,239
I do not go

386
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:44,880
you go

387
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,280
Ziping

388
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,040
open the door

389
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,359
Yes

390
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,880
Why are you still plugged in?

391
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:55,959
knock

392
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,839
Yes

393
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,079
open the door

394
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:00,880
open the door

395
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:01,719
open the door

396
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,199
open the door

397
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:03,959
bumped away

398
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,479
Yes

399
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,319
I will go to serve your majesty

400
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,640
Dress up by yourself

401
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,599
who allowed you to be so presumptuous

402
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,439
no rules

403
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,839
Concubine Zhuang

404
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,160
Please

405
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,959
I thought Concubine Zhuang would never return.

406
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,439
but

407
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,800
How did she get out of Bei'anmen?

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,560
Zijin

409
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,400
Zijin

410
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,040
Zijin

411
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,479
Zijin

412
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,119
What's up

413
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,760
Aren't you your favorite to eat scallops?

414
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
So delicious pancakes

415
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
usually eat

416
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,800
I can't help but swallow my tongue.

417
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,719
do not know why

418
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,520
It's not tasty at all now

419
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,959
This is when I made walnut cheese for Concubine Zhuang

420
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:10,920
leftover food

421
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,079
What's up

422
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,359
where are these from

423
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,040
Liao County cotton walnuts and Lingbao red dates

424
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,479
All are great tributes

425
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,680
here

426
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,199
This is the ingredient that the pharmacist sent to the medicinal meal

427
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,920
Although the nuts are large

428
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,719
But far from soft and crispy walnuts

429
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,959
Still a bit bitter

430
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,760
what is this

431
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,079
Is there any time to make walnut cheese now?

432
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,640
It's for Concubine Zhuang

433
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,760
The number of ingredients delivered recently has become more perfunctory

434
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,920
Basmati Rice Dried Fruit Antlers

435
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,520
There is a problem with the number of seafood in the East China Sea

436
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,520
Wang Sishan is determined not to accept

437
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,199
If it wasn't for the perfunctory servants

438
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,319
I am afraid that I have already gone to ask Guanglu Temple.

439
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,880
I know

440
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,640
I am afraid that Wang Sishan will be stubborn

441
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,800
In case she finds out

442
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll take care of it

443
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,719
Yes

444
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,439
Where did Zijin go today?

445
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,400
you go check it out

446
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,319
I go by myself

447
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,199
empress

448
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:27,160
empress

449
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,680
Zijin

450
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,199
not rude

451
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,959
Zijin

452
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,839
Concubine Zhuang

453
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:43,319
The slaves made walnut cheese for you

454
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,800
you try

455
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,880
Ojizen

456
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,959
I just want to give my last thought

457
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,880
Zijin

458
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,439
Ziping

459
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,280
quick

460
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:47,680
right

461
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,640
When I was a child in Jiangnan

462
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,800
The walnut cheese my mother made for me tastes like this

463
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,160
empress
free at kisskh.me


464
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,599
No matter how great the food

465
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,119
The most beautiful taste in the world

466
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,040
It's the memory of my hometown

467
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,479
I am sorry

468
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,160
i deceived you

469
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,800
I walked out of the Forbidden City

470
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,319
I don't want to come back

471
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,319
But the bearer was scared away

472
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,920
I can only carry my mother

473
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,839
knocking on the door one by one

474
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,719
may cling to our kin

475
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,400
No one dares to resist the containment

476
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,560
But my feet

477
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,160
not far

478
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,680
Even if I give birth to wings

479
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,479
There's no way to fly out of here

480
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,800
Lady, it's time to go

481
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,840
my last moment in this world

482
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,399
is warm

483
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,560
empress

484
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,120
the emperor arrives

485
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:54,800
Your Majesty is down

486
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,560
Has Your Majesty come here specially to see you off?

487
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,479
Today I am willing to die

488
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,360
I beg your majesty to remember your promise

489
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,679
Take good care of my mother for me

490
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:40,159
don't let her be displaced

491
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,399
no branch

492
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,879
His Majesty

493
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Ancestral system cannot be violated

494
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,560
Zijin

495
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,159
Daughter

496
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,479
i went

497
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,800
empress

498
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,679
empress

499
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,639
empress

500
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,679
Madam, are you alright?

501
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,679
go down

502
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:17,679
Now

503
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
do you understand

504
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,360
presumptuous

505
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,760
Concubines and concubines can only be buried without children

506
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,959
After the honorable minister, he was exempted from death according to the law

507
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
not to mention

508
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,600
Your Majesty is in good health

509
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,639
I just

510
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,479
I can't bear it

511
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,320
He died for Emperor Taizu

512
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,840
There are also many concubines who have given birth to children

513
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,040
why not think

514
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:50,399
Who will decide your fate in the end?

515
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,120
you

516
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,199
empress

517
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,879
your hands are shaking

518
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,239
The slaves will take you back to the palace

519
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,800
Ziping

520
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,520
Ziping

521
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,239
Yin Ziping

522
00:39:59,479 --> 00:39:59,919
Ziping

523
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,800
Zijin

524
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,280
Hurry up

525
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,800
you come back

526
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,280
what are you doing

527
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,800
Don't you know how to get out of Bei'anmen?

528
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,040
Now the whole country holds mourning and crying festivals

529
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,080
we still have a chance

530
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,040
go fast

531
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,080
come here

532
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,959
You tell me

533
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:16,120
why are you leaving

534
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,800
burial

535
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:21,520
Only the concubines were buried

536
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,040
We are the maids of Shangshi Bureau

537
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,560
then you promise me

538
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,360
Don't care about the grandson again

539
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,120
Let's not be concubines

540
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,479
Just be a good woman

541
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,399
OK

542
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,080
Ziping

543
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,120
Prosperity, richness and fresh clothes

544
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
everything that is precious

545
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,919
insignificant in the face of life

546
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
look at today's situation

547
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm afraid you will follow in the footsteps of Concubine Zhuang

548
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:46,520
rest assured

549
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,000
I will not

550
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
became a concubine

551
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
if childless

552
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,639
possible burial

553
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,120
became a female officer

554
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
go wrong

555
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,600
worry about life

556
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,479
Go out of the palace today

557
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,679
no way

558
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,959
martial law throughout the city

559
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
How to get out of Beijing

560
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:12,800
lonely woman

561
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,120
how to make a living

562
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:16,360
Even if you start a business

563
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,000
How to hold

564
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,000
Zijin

565
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,719
what can we do

566
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,239
Is there a king's land under the whole world?

567
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,719
Does Concubine Zhuang not want to escape?

568
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,280
she thinks

569
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:35,120
But where did you escape to?

570
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,080
Even if you really escape

571
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,719
That is also the nine tribes

572
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,600
escape

573
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,120
can never escape

574
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,000
Since there is no escape

575
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:50,840
then stay

576
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,120
Ziping

577
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,879
It's a wrong burial

578
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,800
The world is wrong

579
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,600
If it's wrong, correct it

580
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,159
But that's ancestry

581
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,600
Even today's prince can't openly

582
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,280
I'm not afraid

583
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:05,679
Ziping

584
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,239
don't be afraid

585
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:10,600
Whenever you remember four words

586
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,239
man-made

587
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:15,560
Think about it

588
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,040
Whether it's a female officer

589
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
still be a concubine

590
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,280
even the most common people

591
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,439
Who has no trouble

592
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,320
There will always be a way out

593
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,479
wherever you go

594

how far

595
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,719
as long as someone is with you

596
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,800
not alone

597
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,000
have this belief

598
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,560
can support me for a long time

599
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,120
the end

600
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,399
Maybe the way out

601
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,320
Hu Sishan

602
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,159
This is my recipe for medicinal food

603
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,840
take the time to help me see

604
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,080
She gave Concubine Zhuang a jade pendant

605
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,560
Just walked out of Bei'anmen safely

606
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
what kind of jade
