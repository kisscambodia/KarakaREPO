1
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,881
Bold

2
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:25,601
Don't you dare commit the following crimes

3
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,400
Let go

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,720
Let go quickly

5
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:33,841
Let go

6
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,801
If you don't let go, I'll let my father cut off your head

7
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,601
Let go

8
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,961
Zihao, I'm fine

9
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:39,481
You gotta let go

10
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,161
Your Highness Your Highness

11
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,000
You see for yourself

12
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,041
This bowl of boat porridge you just knocked over

13
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,761
In order to preserve the original taste of porridge,

14
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,440
Specially abandoned ordinary food utensils

15
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,121
It was boiled for an hour in a special earthen jar

16
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:56,521
In the meantime, it needs to be stirred constantly

17
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,360
The kitchen's hands are stiff

18
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:00,161
It's not just this bowl of porridge

19
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,041
All the meals here

20
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,241
They all need farmers to work hard

21
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,601
It takes countless efforts from the cooks

22
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,521
But how can you spoil it like this

23
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:10,761
These are all things you should do

24
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:12,480
In addition to cooking, you cooks

25
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
What else will you do

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,440
Farmers don't eat for a day

27
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:17,761
They are unable to cultivate

28
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,640
There is no food in the army reserve

29
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:21,881
You will lose the battle

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,200
What if the granary of the country is empty

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,640
Take what to help the people

32
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,241
Without food, the country will be in turmoil

33
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:30,601
And

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
This is Emperor Taizu

35
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,920
He has warned his descendants countless times

36
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,521
Food is the most precious thing in the world

37
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:40,480
Then why should we despise it so much

38
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,041
A kitchen that makes meals

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,881
And why defy it openly

40
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,241
What about the ancestral precepts of Emperor Taizu

41
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,480
Emperor Taizu once said

42
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,761
Everyone should perform their duties

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,401
The world can maintain long-term stability

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,121
The handmaiden dared to ask

45
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,521
We are cooks

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,241
Is doing one's duty

47
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,480
His Royal Highness is a descendant of the royal family

48
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:02,640
Have you done your duty

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,121
At your age today

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
Have memorized a subset of classics and history

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
Be praised by his ministers

52
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,920
When Emperor Taizong invaded the north,

53
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,601
The Prince is thirteen years old

54
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,761
I have been able to stay in Beijing alone

55
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:16,881
But what about you

56
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:18,080
You are presumptuous

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
No one dares to talk to me like this

58
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,241
Zi Jin

59
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,761
The holy man has issued an order of admonition

60
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,961
Everyone in the world can write a book and give advice

61
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,601
For this reason

62
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,440
Handmaiden only speaks offense

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,200
Please abide by your ancestral precepts

64
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,761
Be kind to the kitchen and cherish the food

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,640
Don't damage the royal dignity

66
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:45,601
Big brother, bad woman bullies me

67
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,760
Big Brother, she abused me

68
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,681
You killed her for me

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,961
Let's all go down

70
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,441
How dangerous that was

71
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:23,920
In case Wei Wang really goes crazy

72
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Insist on cutting off your head

73
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,121
Fortunately, His Royal Highness the Prince was present

74
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,160
Do you think that with the personality of King Wei

75
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,040
He will give up.

76
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,401
Did you just get hurt

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,480
Xiao Shi

78
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,281
You've been sickly all this time

79
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:45,241
Everyone indulges you

80
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,281
But what you did today

81
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,640
Big Brother is very disappointed

82
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,880
You are the prince of Daming, the son of Zhu family

83
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,480
How can you be so presumptuous

84
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:56,480
Brother won't even help me with you

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,080
If you lose your temper with your servants in the future,

86
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
Go to the wall for one day

87
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:05,360
Sit down

88
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:14,401
Xiao Shi

89
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,880
Possessing power should be exercised with caution

90
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,121
Holding a knife and axe should fear life more

91
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,681
A person depends on his origin alone

92
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,961
Can't be respected

93
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:25,600
What really determines your position in the eyes of the world

94
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,360
It's your words and deeds

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,721
Just now, the female official asked you

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
You are speechless

97
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,080
Why

98
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,121
Just because she occupies reason and righteousness

99
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,121
If you only know how to lose your temper and cut off people's heads

100
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:40,281
Then no one will ever really respect you

101
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,681
Do you understand

102
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,480
Keep up with her

103
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,920
Your Royal Highness, King Wei, you have been following the handmaiden

104
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:27,600
What is the intention?

105
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:28,561
Take down

106
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:31,401
Stop

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,320
Down

108
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,561
Imperial concubine empress Meng Shangshi

109
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,281
Mother concubine

110
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,721
Ayan

111
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,640
Ayan

112
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,600
Mother concubine

113
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,961
You did a good job

114
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:50,640
Ayan

115
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:54,681
Shang Shi

116
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,521
Courtiers choose wise kings to serve

117
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,920
That female official is the same

118
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:03,961
With all due respect

119
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,080
People like the Imperial Concubine are not worthy of your service

120
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,241
When the water is clear, there is no fish

121
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:12,360
If the imperial concubine has no intention,

122
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,521
How to win your majesty's guilt and love

123
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,640
Have today's status and power

124
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,401
You saw it with your own eyes

125
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,640
What happened to the weak Zhuang Fei of the First Emperor

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Doesn't that really alert you

127
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,320
Meng Shang Shi

128
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,320
Zi Jin

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,001
I hope one day you can be a shangshi

130
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,160
How do you look at me

131
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:37,121
Grow step by step

132
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,121
Until you can support the whole food bureau

133
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,681
Hu Shangshi has lost the favor of the queen

134
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,801
There is no way to match you

135
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:53,721
I would like to ask

136
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,121
What else do you want

137
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,961
What exactly do you want

138
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,840
In the early years of Hongwu, there were female officials

139
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,081
Assisting Zhonggong to educate concubines

140
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,480
Take charge of all matters of the palace

141
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,720
And formulate the standard of Daming code instrument

142
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,600
Can set an example for women in the world

143
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,600
However, since the first emperor,

144
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,840
Eunuchs are reused

145
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,720
Female officials are losing power

146
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,280
Six innings are in name only

147
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,160
I am loyal to the empress

148
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:26,040
Is to restore the old system one day

149
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,321
Become the first palace in Daming

150
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,201
You

151
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,201
Bother to create a good opportunity for you

152
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:46,801
I hope you can firmly grasp it

153
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:48,681
How is it

154
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,201
Can I trust you

155
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,840
In order to stay in Shangshi Bureau,

156
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,520
I don't have a second choice

157
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,720
The emperor worked hard every day

158
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,960
Only when eating is the most relaxed

159
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,441
Still eat this position

160
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,001
Often have unexpected effects

161
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,720
How did Meng Shangshi defeat Guang Luqing Jing Quan

162
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:10,480
You remember, don't you

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Wait for me to become a still food

164
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,001
I will give you back

165
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,960
I will remember your words

166
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,241
Go ahead

167
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,840
Your Excellency

168
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,600
I told you not to send these things

169
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:46,280
The room can't fit

170
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,121
This invulnerable soft armor

171
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:49,641
This is the only thing in the world

172
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
The prince himself is reluctant to wear it

173
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,040
I brought it to you

174
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,040
Your Majesty wants to see you

175
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,121
According to the Royal Guards' interrogation

176
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:20,480
Dai Yuan admitted

177
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,400
Guo Guifei concealed Wei Wang's illness

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,321
This matter is of great importance

179
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:25,920
Involving Wei Wang's health

180
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,840
So my son had to report to my father

181
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,641
Guo Guifei is the biological mother of Wei Wang

182
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,400
Is she concerned about chaos or something else

183
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,001
Please also ask my father to make a clear decision

184
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,040
Tea

185
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,520
Tea

186
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,881
Tea

187
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:26,280
Your Majesty

188
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:05,520
Your Majesty, pardon

189
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:08,761
Your Majesty, pardon

190
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:40,761
Father

191
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:48,121
Good

192
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,920
Come

193
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,160
One sail

194
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,480
What my father brought you before

195
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:01,520
Are they all used up

196
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:04,121
I don't lack anything around me

197
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,201
Father doesn't have to send anything into the palace anymore

198
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,480
You met your own father

199
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,081
I think my father is in trouble

200
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,561
Why do you say such a thing

201
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:20,840
Father doesn't blame you

202
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,520
That's your real father after all

203
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,881
I am wandering in a foreign land and dying

204
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,241
You found me

205
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,121
At that time, it was unruly

206
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,241
Rather die than go back

207
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,520
You took me in again

208
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:36,321
Over the years

209
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
My literary talent, martial arts, mental strategy

210
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,480
Which one didn't you teach yourself

211
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:41,960
Except for you

212
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:44,441
Who deserves to be my father

213
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:06,600
Shoot

214
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,280
When I secretly took you in

215
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:16,441
At first, I just wanted to hold more chips for my second brother

216
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,801
Later, I taught it carefully

217
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,641
It is also because you are a material that can be made

218
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,480
After all, my two sons

219
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
A sickly man

220
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:27,201
A dull and stubborn

221
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,360
It's really unbearable

222
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,160
If they have half of yours,

223
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,520
My father remembers when he was thirteen years old

224
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:35,321
Will you take me hunting

225
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,840
Wolves raid the camp at night

226
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,520
You could have run away from me

227
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,441
But regardless of their own safety

228
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,121
Saved me abruptly from the wolf's mouth

229
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,920
I was seriously injured

230
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,040
Father's Grace

231
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:51,801
A sail will never be forgotten

232
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,360
Father

233
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,761
I don't know how long I can take care of you

234
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,881
This has been like loyalty since ancient times

235
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,241
Great deception is like faith

236
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:05,081
My big brother

237
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
It is the man who is a big traitor and a big evil

238
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,001
Ever since he ascended the throne,

239
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,001
On the bright side, I am taken care of in every possible way

240
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,400
But secretly, I have been coercing my vassal

241
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,600
When I get to Zhangde,

242
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:22,720
In less than two years

243
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,241
After all, you can't escape the end of nothing

244
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,681
Our father and son

245
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,001
I'm afraid there is no future goodbye

246
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,081
My father's thoughts for many years

247
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,721
How could my son not know

248
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:40,880
You can rest assured

249
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,400
One day I will fulfill your wish for you

250
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,240
Good son

251
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,321
Father believes in you

252
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,201
Let this dry in the shade

253
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:39,361
Yes

254
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,321
What is she going to do

255
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,640
Sister Sue

256
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,120
Has followed your orders

257
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,760
Put the milk skin in a cool place

258
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,240
Anything else

259
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,240
You go get some more clams

260
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,561
Bamboo shoot chicken belly and sea cucumber come over

261
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I want to cook for your majesty

262
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,201
Yes

263
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,040
No need

264
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:24,920
The Imperial Palace in Nanjing is being repaired

265
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,321
The food of officials and craftsmen needs to be cooked

266
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,801
Guanglu Temple is about to send 200 cooks

267
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,321
You get ready

268
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,721
Let's start tomorrow

269
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:35,801
Meng Shang Shi

270
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,961
What did I do wrong? You want to transfer me somewhere else

271
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:42,081
The service of female officials in the imperial court is subject to demand

272
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,561
Go wherever you are needed

273
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,081
Is cooking for the nobles making food

274
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:51,520
Is cooking for ordinary craftsmen wronged you

275
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,000
Meng Shang Shi

276
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,280
You all hear me clearly

277
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,801
Farmers get barren land

278
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,760
Will work harder to cultivate

279
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,481
Doctors don't distinguish between rich and poor

280
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,481
Will treat patients equally

281
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,040
This is true of all industries in the world

282
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,801
As a kitchen

283
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,441
No matter what kind of people make meals, they should devote themselves to it

284
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,441
If you want to pick on the object

285
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,240
Then you don't deserve to go to the kitchen

286
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,321
Yes

287
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:21,280
Meng Shang Shi

288
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,640
My father-in-law Liu

289
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:29,081
Father-in-law Liu, why did you come in person

290
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:30,801
It's your majesty. What do you want

291
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,040
Miss Su

292
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,961
Why hasn't the milk skin your majesty needs been sent yet

293
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,000
Father-in-law Liu's handmaiden is already doing it

294
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,081
It's just

295
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,561
Father-in-law Liu is going to work in Nanjing soon

296
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,561
What can I do then?

297
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:51,920
Your Majesty's Oracle

298
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,601
Su Yuehua learned from famous artists with exquisite skills

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,961
I will be promoted to the steward on the same day

300
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,681
Specially made meals for Ganqing Palace

301
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:07,801
Thank you for your grace

302
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,160
Such an exceptional promotion

303
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,760
It's the first time in the palace

304
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's right. It never happened before

305
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,280
Father

306
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
Just now, I sent someone to meet Ayan in your palace

307
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,601
Why stop

308
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,561
I'm talking to you

309
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:00,400
My father and son said it himself

310
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,120
Ayan is my own brother

311
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:03,201
I want to protect him

312
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:06,801
Do you think I will hurt him

313
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,000
Father

314
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,081
The way to stand

315
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,601
Don't precede the words filial piety and loyalty

316
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,841
My son is the prince of Daming

317
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,040
Chu Jun of a country

318
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,040
In addition to the righteousness of the Ming monarch and his son,

319
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:20,601
The love of brothers should be thicker

320
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:22,361
Do your best in the order of old and young

321
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:24,120
I can't let one

322
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,040
A woman in a deep palace with limited vision

323
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:29,120
To educate and guide my own brothers

324
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:30,561
This will only hurt him

325
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,920
It's time for the emperor to eat

326
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,240
Why don't you sit down, too

327
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:38,880
Thank your father

328
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,920
Your Majesty loves tea

329
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:31,120
This snack is made like making tea

330
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
Hence the name tea soup

331
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:03,160
What you said just now is quite reasonable

332
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:06,601
What if you are free in the future

333
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,081
Come and spend more time with your father

334
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,880
Yes

335
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:13,880
Eat chicken

336
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:14,841
Good

337
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,120
Your Highness has not been so happy for a long time

338
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:28,441
Is there any good thing

339
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:37,760
Isn't there no memorial recently

340
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:39,120
What's going on

341
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:40,201
Your Highness

342
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,321
Today, there are households who transport grain

343
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,920
And silver cloth to the capital

344
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,160
In case of exploitation by receiving officials,

345
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:56,640
The so-called method of grain acceptance

346
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,280
Cover the amount of bribes as beauty and evil

347
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,000
The home of the pro-democracy movement is unbearable for exploitation

348
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,880
There are many people who are unable to return home

349
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,280
Begging for the Ministry of Industry to allocate open space to accommodate the households

350
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:10,481
However, it can't solve the long-term difficulties

351
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,801
It is advisable to send a supervisory empire to each member of the matter

352
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:18,880
Du Wucheng's military forces patrol from time to time

353
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,240
Dare to extort money from households

354
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Ask for guilt with a play

355
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,160
I secretly heard that the monks and Taoists in the world between Hongwu gave excessive genealogy

356
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,280
Make the monk record department and the road record department make a book

357
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,040
Promulgate the Temple of the World

358
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:36,081
Whenever you meet monks and Taoism, you should check the book

359
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:40,520
I heard that all officials in the world can't be virtuous

360
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:43,000
Repeatedly supervised the empire

361
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,801
According to the inspection department, the assessment is carried out

362
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:47,721
And the company did not make a detailed investigation

363
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:01,920
Sosur meal

364
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,880
Are you going to prepare supper for your majesty

365
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:07,760
I really want to help

366
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,601
Meng Shang eats during the day

367
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:11,081
I really am

368
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,561
Can't

369
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,880
Get the jar of water I prepared

370
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,441
This meat needs fresh river water

371
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,841
Simmering so slowly all night

372
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,280
Pork will be crisp, rotten and delicious

373
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Extremely delicious

374
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,240
Your Majesty wants to pickle pig's trotters with bad food tomorrow

375
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,240
Would you please go to the cellar and get the ingredients

376
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,640
Yes

377
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,760
Now I'm a steward

378
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,481
You mustn't fall too far behind

379
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,441
Your Majesty likes to eat greasy meat

380
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,361
But these are not good for the health of dragons

381
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,400
Pay more attention when you prepare meals

382
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:37,640
Yao Ziliao

383
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:40,520
I've just been promoted to the table

384
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,920
Why don't you say congratulations

385
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,040
Why are you so narrow-minded

386
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,801
Is to remind you

387
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:50,201
Your Majesty's constitution should be light and his diet should be light

388
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,880
It is not advisable to use more night food

389
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:54,321
You just ingratiate yourself

390
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,441
Goose gizzard palm presented

391
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,081
Pickled pig's trotters and milk skin

392
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:01,841
They all hurt the dragon body

393
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,040
Moon flower

394
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,081
This world is very harsh on women

395
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,240
Once you take the shortcut,

396
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,481
The world will ignore your efforts and strength

397
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,601
Every step you take in the future

398
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:23,640
Can't get rid of the slander of gossip

399
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,920
You are excellent

400
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:28,801
Just keep your feet on the ground

401
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:29,841
I can't go to Nanjing

402
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
I have unfinished wishes

403
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,040
I can't go to Nanjing under any circumstances

404
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:17,961
I remember

405
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,601
You made the last vegetarian diet, didn't you

406
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:27,160
Children

407
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:31,160
Don't do this side-of-the-road thing in the future

408
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,681
Concentrate on cooking

409
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:01,681
Shortly after Wang Sishan returned home,

410
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,721
Was found hanging himself

411
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,920
This is her relic

412
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,721
Moon flower

413
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:29,561
This is the experience of cooking in my life

414
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,240
It's the only thing I can leave you

415
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,961
I hope you will one day

416
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,081
Realize one's long-cherished wish

417
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,201
Become the best kitchen in the world

418
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,880
Master

419
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,721
Meng's and Hu's

420
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:54,040
None of them deserve to cook food

421
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,601
You have a spirit in heaven

422
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,160
Please bless me

423
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:05,400
Get one's wish at an early date

424
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,920
Remote clearing

425
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,400
Don't blame me

426
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:42,481
I'm sorry

427
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:51,201
Come

428
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:52,841
Father

429
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,240
Son, it's just in time

430
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,801
Taste delicious food with my father

431
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:57,681
It's the father

432
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,361
My son has a picture

433
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:00,321
I want to invite my father to enjoy it

434
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:01,841
Unfortunately, there was no chance in the past

435
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:06,321
Events in the world are also waiting after dinner

436
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,601
Yes

437
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:24,520
It's extremely crisp and rotten

438
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,201
Rare and rare

439
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,160
Father's pork is fat and greasy

440
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:33,240
It's better to eat less

441
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,920
Not in the way

442
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,240
What the prince said is extremely true

443
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:40,481
The so-called deficiency makes up for the cold and warms it

444
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,081
Warm the spleen and stomach with mutton in winter

445
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:45,601
It is timely to treat lung deficiency strain

446
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,561
You might as well try this mutton soup

447
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,481
Good

448
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,400
Have a taste together

449
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,481
Come

450
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,361
Yes

451
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:02,040
Eat

452
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:13,361
In the past, mutton smelled too heavy

453
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,601
Therefore, the chef will press it with heavy salt and taste

454
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:18,240
But this time the mutton

455
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:19,520
There is no smell of mutton at all

456
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,721
Why

457
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,321
The handmaiden specially added almonds and cooked them together

458
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:26,801
No wonder, no wonder

459
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,361
Your Majesty has used more meat recently

460
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,760
Why don't you use dandelion tea to get rid of the fire and moisten it

461
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:47,240
Your Majesty

462
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:48,681
Scared me

463
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:50,240
Your Majesty

464
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:51,361
Your Majesty

465
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,120
Father

466
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:53,880
What's wrong

467
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,120
Bleeding

468
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:55,880
Who bleeds

469
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,721
Nose nose

470
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:57,481
My nose

471
00:33:57,481 --> 00:33:58,201
I

472
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,880
Where do people come?

473
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:01,361
Take these down

474
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:02,120
Father

475
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,640
Quick, quick, quick

476
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:04,160
Get these down quickly

477
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,400
Quickly

478
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,520
Quickly withdraw

479
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,920
Withdraw and withdraw

480
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:35,000
Your Majesty, this is overheating of lung qi

481
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,081
Will qi and blood go up and down

482
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:41,121
Don't move

483
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:42,801
Don't move

484
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:46,520
Why did the doctor's father suddenly have symptoms

485
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,361
His Royal Highness the Prince

486
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,200
Your Majesty's tongue coating is yellow and greasy, and his nose is hot and dry

487
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,921
And often thirsty

488
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
They are all signs of excessive lung fire

489
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,440
It is the thing that clears heat and cools blood on weekdays

490
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:03,040
Father, can you hear me

491
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,480
Meat and greasy food hurts the dragon body

492
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:07,881
Don't eat it in the future

493
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,240
Newspaper

494
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,641
Meng Shangshi, Shangshi Bureau

495
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:13,960
Let her in

496
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:15,121
Yes

497
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,040
I heard that your majesty is unwell

498
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,040
The handmaiden was deeply frightened

499
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,240
Specially prepare things for clearing heat and moistening lung

500
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,841
After the doctor saw it,

501
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:47,240
Please take it again

502
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,321
Is it delicious

503
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,561
Sweet

504
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,440
Not as sweet as you

505
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:15,040
Can you use medicated diet now

506
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,881
Get in

507
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,361
Guiling ointment nourishes yin, moistens lung, clears heat and removes fire

508
00:36:30,561 --> 00:36:31,801
Appropriate to Your Majesty's physique

509
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,401
I wanted to boil this medicated diet before

510
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:37,121
It just takes about ten hours to cook this turtle shell

511
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,561
I'm really afraid of delaying your majesty's illness

512
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,561
Or is Meng Shangshi thoughtful

513
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,680
It's a coincidence that the food bureau is thoughtful

514
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,321
Add two spoonfuls of honey

515
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:51,680
Yes

516
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,801
In the past, every summer

517
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,480
The palace always uses this thing to moisten dryness

518
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,000
His Royal Highness King Wei has always said that his throat is sore and hot recently

519
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:06,561
It was specially made by the Food Bureau for standby

520
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:09,240
I didn't expect it to come in handy

521
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:15,960
Father

522
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:19,641
Do you remember what you said to your son

523
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,801
Xuan Guo Guifei went to the temple

524
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,161
Yes

525
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:43,720
Zhan Ji

526
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,601
Zhan Ji

527
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
Stand down, everybody

528
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:00,161
Your Majesty

529
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:04,280
Your Majesty

530
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,720
Your Majesty

531
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:12,641
Bearer

532
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,000
What are you doing

533
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:20,040
Empress, what are you doing, empress

534
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:21,960
Empress

535
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,121
What are you doing, Empress

536
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,561
Begin

537
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,121
Empress, I beg you not to

538
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:30,401
Don't destroy my hand

539
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,161
I beg you, empress

540
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:33,641
As a kitchen

541
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,520
You don't cook well

542
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,321
Wishful thinking all day long

543
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Read climbing the dragon and attaching phoenix

544
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:43,000
Your hands

545
00:40:44,161 --> 00:40:46,040
Nature can't stay

546
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:46,960
No

547
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,240
Just keep me

548
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,361
I don't think of anything anymore

549
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm not doing anything

550
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,960
I don't want anything

551
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,520
I beg you, empress

552
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,161
Just keep my hands

553
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:58,081
I don't want anything

554
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,601
Don't, don't, empress

555
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:12,361
Handmaiden daring

556
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:14,680
Please ask the imperial concubine to forgive her

557
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:16,440
Yao canon meal

558
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:19,081
Don't rely on small credit to be so presumptuous

559
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,440
This is not your business

560
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:25,561
Imperial concubine empress, you promised the handmaiden

561
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:28,641
If the empress of the handmaiden gang sees your majesty again

562
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,081
Can you promise a handmaiden a wish

563
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:33,561
The handmaiden asked the empress to forgive her

564
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:42,081
Are your wishes wasted by doing so

565
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:52,720
Empress

566
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:57,200
Susi food has the dexterest hands in the world

567
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,240
Doesn't the empress appreciate it too

568
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,280
A sample of her restored Wangchuan map

569
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:03,921
In this world except her

570
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:04,960
No one else

571
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,520
Can restore such a delicate picture

572
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:09,561
Get out of the way

573
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,240
Please keep your promise

574
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,641
Help the handmaiden forgive her

575
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,121
Go

576
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:54,240
Why do you want to be stubborn

577
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,280
Be stubborn

578
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,841
I treat you as a bosom friend

579
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,520
And you only value that

580
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,480
Yin Ziping is useless

581
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,641
What's so good about her

582
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,801
I follow Master

583
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,000
I want to temper my skills well

584
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,121
She's just like you

585
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,000
For a man who is not worth it at all

586
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:22,841
Do not hesitate to throw moths into the fire

587
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,561
Whatever I ask and what I want

588
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:27,601
It's all empty in the end

589
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,161
Why

590
00:43:30,881 --> 00:43:31,680
With what

591
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:33,440
Moon flower

592
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:34,321
In any case

593
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,601
I won't even be grateful to you

594
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,081
I never begged you to save me

595
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,240
I didn't save you either

596
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,641
It was your hands that restored Wang Chuan Tu

597
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:57,361
Moon flower

598
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,760
As a kitchen

599
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:03,921
You must finally see the real chapter in the skill of cooking

600
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:08,641
I forgot to tell you

601
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:10,881
The food list of the burning feast

602
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,240
I have tried it from beginning to end

603
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,401
What about you

604
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,321
How many more medical books have you memorized
