1
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,080
Bold

2
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,800
Don't you dare commit the following crimes

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,599
Let go
free at kisskh.me

4
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:57,919
Let go quickly

5
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Let go

6
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,000
If you don't let go, I'll let my father cut off your head

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,800
Let go

8
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,160
Zihao, I'm fine

9
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,680
You gotta let go

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
Your Highness Your Highness

11
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,199
You see for yourself

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,240
This bowl of boat porridge you just knocked over

13
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,960
In order to preserve the original taste of porridge,

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,639
Specially abandoned ordinary food utensils

15
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,320
It was boiled for an hour in a special earthen jar

16
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,720
In the meantime, it needs to be stirred constantly

17
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,559
The kitchen's hands are stiff

18
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,360
It's not just this bowl of porridge

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,240
All the meals here

20
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,440
They all need farmers to work hard

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,800
It takes countless efforts from the cooks

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,720
But how can you spoil it like this

23
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,960
These are all things you should do

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,679
In addition to cooking, you cooks

25
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,639
What else will you do

26
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,639
Farmers don't eat for a day

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
They are unable to cultivate

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,839
There is no food in the army reserve

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,080
You will lose the battle

30
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,399
What if the granary of the country is empty

31
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,839
Take what to help the people

32
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Without food, the country will be in turmoil

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,800
And

34
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,759
This is Emperor Taizu

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,119
He has warned his descendants countless times

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,720
Food is the most precious thing in the world

37
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,679
Then why should we despise it so much

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,240
A kitchen that makes meals

39
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,080
And why defy it openly

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,440
What about the ancestral precepts of Emperor Taizu

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,679
Emperor Taizu once said

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
Everyone should perform their duties

43
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,600
The world can maintain long-term stability

44
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,320
The handmaiden dared to ask

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,720
We are cooks

46
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,440
Is doing one's duty

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,679
His Royal Highness is a descendant of the royal family

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,839
Have you done your duty

49
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,320
At your age today

50
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,119
Have memorized a subset of classics and history

51
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,679
Be praised by his ministers

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,119
When Emperor Taizong invaded the north,

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,800
The Prince is thirteen years old

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,960
I have been able to stay in Beijing alone

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
But what about you

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,279
You are presumptuous

57
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,399
No one dares to talk to me like this

58
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,440
Zi Jin

59
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,960
The holy man has issued an order of admonition

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,160
Everyone in the world can write a book and give advice

61
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,800
For this reason

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,639
Handmaiden only speaks offense

63
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,399
Please abide by your ancestral precepts

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Be kind to the kitchen and cherish the food

65
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,839
Don't damage the royal dignity

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,800
Big brother, bad woman bullies me

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,959
Big Brother, she abused me

68
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,880
You killed her for me

69
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,160
Let's all go down

70
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,640
How dangerous that was

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,119
In case Wei Wang really goes crazy

72
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,359
Insist on cutting off your head

73
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,320
Fortunately, His Royal Highness the Prince was present

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,359
Do you think that with the personality of King Wei

75
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,239
He will give up.

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
Did you just get hurt

77
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:08,679
Xiao Shi

78
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,480
You've been sickly all this time

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,440
Everyone indulges you

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,480
But what you did today

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,839
Big Brother is very disappointed

82
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,079
You are the prince of Daming, the son of Zhu family

83
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,679
How can you be so presumptuous

84
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,679
Brother won't even help me with you

85
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:26,279
If you lose your temper with your servants in the future,

86
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,079
Go to the wall for one day

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,559
Sit down

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,600
Xiao Shi

89
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,079
Possessing power should be exercised with caution

90
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,320
Holding a knife and axe should fear life more

91
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,880
A person depends on his origin alone

92
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,160
Can't be respected

93
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,799
What really determines your position in the eyes of the world

94
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,559
It's your words and deeds

95
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,920
Just now, the female official asked you

96
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,239
You are speechless

97
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,279
Why

98
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,320
Just because she occupies reason and righteousness

99
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,320
If you only know how to lose your temper and cut off people's heads

100
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,480
Then no one will ever really respect you

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,880
Do you understand

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,679
Keep up with her

103
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,119
Your Royal Highness, King Wei, you have been following the handmaiden

104
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,799
What is the intention?

105
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Take down

106
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
Stop

107
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,519
Down

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,760
Imperial concubine empress Meng Shangshi

109
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,480
Mother concubine

110
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,920
Ayan

111
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,839
Ayan

112
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,799
Mother concubine

113
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,160
You did a good job

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,839
Ayan

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,880
Shang Shi

116
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Courtiers choose wise kings to serve

117
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,119
That female official is the same

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,160
With all due respect

119
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,279
People like the Imperial Concubine are not worthy of your service

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,440
When the water is clear, there is no fish

121
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,559
If the imperial concubine has no intention,

122
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,720
How to win your majesty's guilt and love

123
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,839
Have today's status and power

124
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,600
You saw it with your own eyes

125
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,839
What happened to the weak Zhuang Fei of the First Emperor

126
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,279
Doesn't that really alert you

127
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,519
Meng Shang Shi

128
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,519
Zi Jin

129
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,200
I hope one day you can be a shangshi

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,359
How do you look at me

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,320
Grow step by step

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,320
Until you can support the whole food bureau

133
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,880
Hu Shangshi has lost the favor of the queen

134
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,000
There is no way to match you

135
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,920
I would like to ask

136
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,320
What else do you want

137
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,160
What exactly do you want

138
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,039
In the early years of Hongwu, there were female officials

139
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,280
Assisting Zhonggong to educate concubines

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,679
Take charge of all matters of the palace

141
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,919
And formulate the standard of Daming code instrument

142
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,799
Can set an example for women in the world

143
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,799
However, since the first emperor,

144
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,039
Eunuchs are reused

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,919
Female officials are losing power

146
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,479
Six innings are in name only

147
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,359
I am loyal to the empress

148
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,239
Is to restore the old system one day

149
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Become the first palace in Daming

150
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,400
You

151
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,400
Bother to create a good opportunity for you

152
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,000
I hope you can firmly grasp it

153
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,880
How is it

154
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,400
Can I trust you

155
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,039
In order to stay in Shangshi Bureau,

156
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,719
I don't have a second choice

157
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,919
The emperor worked hard every day

158
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,159
Only when eating is the most relaxed

159
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
Still eat this position

160
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,200
Often have unexpected effects

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,919
How did Meng Shangshi defeat Guang Luqing Jing Quan

162
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,679
You remember, don't you

163
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,919
Wait for me to become a still food

164
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,200
I will give you back

165
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,159
I will remember your words

166
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,440
Go ahead

167
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,039
Your Excellency

168
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,799
I told you not to send these things

169
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,479
The room can't fit

170
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,320
This invulnerable soft armor

171
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
This is the only thing in the world

172
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,159
The prince himself is reluctant to wear it

173
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,239
I brought it to you

174
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,239
Your Majesty wants to see you

175
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,320
According to the Royal Guards' interrogation

176
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,679
Dai Yuan admitted

177
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,599
Guo Guifei concealed Wei Wang's illness

178
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,520
This matter is of great importance

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,119
Involving Wei Wang's health

180
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,039
So my son had to report to my father

181
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,840
Guo Guifei is the biological mother of Wei Wang

182
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,599
Is she concerned about chaos or something else

183
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,200
Please also ask my father to make a clear decision

184
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,239
Tea

185
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:19,719
Tea

186
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,080
Tea

187
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,479
Your Majesty

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,719
Your Majesty, pardon

189
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,960
Your Majesty, pardon

190
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,960
Father

191
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,320
Good

192
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,119
Come

193
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,359
One sail

194
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,679
What my father brought you before

195
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,719
Are they all used up

196
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
I don't lack anything around me

197
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,400
Father doesn't have to send anything into the palace anymore

198
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,679
You met your own father

199
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,280
I think my father is in trouble

200
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,760
Why do you say such a thing

201
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,039
Father doesn't blame you

202
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,719
That's your real father after all

203
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,080
I am wandering in a foreign land and dying

204
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
You found me

205
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,320
At that time, it was unruly

206
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,440
Rather die than go back

207
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,719
You took me in again

208
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,520
Over the years

209
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,159
My literary talent, martial arts, mental strategy

210
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,679
Which one didn't you teach yourself

211
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,159
Except for you

212
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,640
Who deserves to be my father

213
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,799
Shoot
free at kisskh.me

214
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,479
When I secretly took you in

215
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,640
At first, I just wanted to hold more chips for my second brother

216
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,000
Later, I taught it carefully

217
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,840
It is also because you are a material that can be made

218
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,679
After all, my two sons

219
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,159
A sickly man

220
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,400
A dull and stubborn

221
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,559
It's really unbearable

222
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,359
If they have half of yours,

223
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,719
My father remembers when he was thirteen years old

224
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Will you take me hunting

225
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,039
Wolves raid the camp at night

226
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,719
You could have run away from me

227
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,640
But regardless of their own safety

228
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,320
Saved me abruptly from the wolf's mouth

229
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,119
I was seriously injured

230
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,239
Father's Grace

231
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,000
A sail will never be forgotten

232
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,559
Father

233
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,960
I don't know how long I can take care of you

234
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,080
This has been like loyalty since ancient times

235
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Great deception is like faith

236
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
My big brother

237
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,359
It is the man who is a big traitor and a big evil

238
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,200
Ever since he ascended the throne,

239
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,200
On the bright side, I am taken care of in every possible way

240
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,599
But secretly, I have been coercing my vassal

241
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,799
When I get to Zhangde,

242
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,919
In less than two years

243
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,440
After all, you can't escape the end of nothing

244
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,880
Our father and son

245
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm afraid there is no future goodbye

246
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,280
My father's thoughts for many years

247
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
How could my son not know

248
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,079
You can rest assured

249
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,599
One day I will fulfill your wish for you

250
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,439
Good son

251
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,520
Father believes in you

252
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Let this dry in the shade

253
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Yes

254
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,520
What is she going to do

255
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:32,839
Sister Sue

256
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,319
Has followed your orders

257
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,959
Put the milk skin in a cool place

258
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,439
Anything else

259
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,439
You go get some more clams

260
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,760
Bamboo shoot chicken belly and sea cucumber come over

261
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,239
I want to cook for your majesty

262
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,400
Yes

263
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,239
No need

264
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,119
The Imperial Palace in Nanjing is being repaired

265
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,520
The food of officials and craftsmen needs to be cooked

266
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
Guanglu Temple is about to send 200 cooks

267
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
You get ready

268
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,920
Let's start tomorrow

269
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,000
Meng Shang Shi

270
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,160
What did I do wrong? You want to transfer me somewhere else

271
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,280
The service of female officials in the imperial court is subject to demand

272
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,760
Go wherever you are needed

273
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:15,280
Is cooking for the nobles making food

274
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,719
Is cooking for ordinary craftsmen wronged you

275
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,199
Meng Shang Shi

276
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,479
You all hear me clearly

277
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,000
Farmers get barren land

278
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:27,959
Will work harder to cultivate

279
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,680
Doctors don't distinguish between rich and poor

280
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,680
Will treat patients equally

281
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,239
This is true of all industries in the world

282
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,000
As a kitchen

283
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,640
No matter what kind of people make meals, they should devote themselves to it

284
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,640
If you want to pick on the object

285
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,439
Then you don't deserve to go to the kitchen

286
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,520
Yes

287
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,479
Meng Shang Shi

288
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,839
My father-in-law Liu

289
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,280
Father-in-law Liu, why did you come in person

290
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
It's your majesty. What do you want

291
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,239
Miss Su

292
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,160
Why hasn't the milk skin your majesty needs been sent yet

293
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,199
Father-in-law Liu's handmaiden is already doing it

294
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,280
It's just

295
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,760
Father-in-law Liu is going to work in Nanjing soon

296
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,760
What can I do then?

297
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,119
Your Majesty's Oracle

298
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:26,800
Su Yuehua learned from famous artists with exquisite skills

299
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,160
I will be promoted to the steward on the same day

300
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,880
Specially made meals for Ganqing Palace

301
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you for your grace

302
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,359
Such an exceptional promotion

303
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,959
It's the first time in the palace

304
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,199
That's right. It never happened before

305
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:09,479
Father

306
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,439
Just now, I sent someone to meet Ayan in your palace

307
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Why stop

308
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm talking to you

309
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,599
My father and son said it himself

310
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,319
Ayan is my own brother

311
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,400
I want to protect him

312
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,000
Do you think I will hurt him

313
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,199
Father

314
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,280
The way to stand

315
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,800
Don't precede the words filial piety and loyalty

316
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,040
My son is the prince of Daming

317
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,239
Chu Jun of a country

318
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,239
In addition to the righteousness of the Ming monarch and his son,

319
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,800
The love of brothers should be thicker

320
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,560
Do your best in the order of old and young

321
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,319
I can't let one

322
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,239
A woman in a deep palace with limited vision

323
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,319
To educate and guide my own brothers

324
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
This will only hurt him

325
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,119
It's time for the emperor to eat

326
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,439
Why don't you sit down, too

327
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,079
Thank your father

328
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,119
Your Majesty loves tea

329
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,319
This snack is made like making tea

330
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,119
Hence the name tea soup

331
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,359
What you said just now is quite reasonable

332
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,800
What if you are free in the future

333
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,280
Come and spend more time with your father

334
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,079
Yes

335
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,079
Eat chicken

336
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,040
Good

337
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,319
Your Highness has not been so happy for a long time

338
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,640
Is there any good thing

339
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,959
Isn't there no memorial recently

340
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,319
What's going on

341
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Your Highness

342
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,520
Today, there are households who transport grain

343
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,119
And silver cloth to the capital

344
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,359
In case of exploitation by receiving officials,

345
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,839
The so-called method of grain acceptance

346
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,479
Cover the amount of bribes as beauty and evil

347
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,199
The home of the pro-democracy movement is unbearable for exploitation

348
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,079
There are many people who are unable to return home

349
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,479
Begging for the Ministry of Industry to allocate open space to accommodate the households

350
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,680
However, it can't solve the long-term difficulties

351
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:43,000
It is advisable to send a supervisory empire to each member of the matter

352
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,079
Du Wucheng's military forces patrol from time to time

353
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,439
Dare to extort money from households

354
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,439
Ask for guilt with a play

355
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,359
I secretly heard that the monks and Taoists in the world between Hongwu gave excessive genealogy

356
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,479
Make the monk record department and the road record department make a book

357
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,239
Promulgate the Temple of the World

358
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
Whenever you meet monks and Taoism, you should check the book

359
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,719
I heard that all officials in the world can't be virtuous

360
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,199
Repeatedly supervised the empire

361
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,000
According to the inspection department, the assessment is carried out

362
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,920
And the company did not make a detailed investigation

363
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,119
Sosur meal

364
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,079
Are you going to prepare supper for your majesty

365
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,959
I really want to help

366
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,800
Meng Shang eats during the day

367
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,280
I really am

368
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:52,760
Can't

369
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,079
Get the jar of water I prepared

370
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,640
This meat needs fresh river water

371
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
Simmering so slowly all night

372
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,479
Pork will be crisp, rotten and delicious

373
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,479
Extremely delicious

374
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,439
Your Majesty wants to pickle pig's trotters with bad food tomorrow

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,439
Would you please go to the cellar and get the ingredients

376
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:27,839
Yes

377
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,959
Now I'm a steward

378
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,680
You mustn't fall too far behind

379
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,640
Your Majesty likes to eat greasy meat

380
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,560
But these are not good for the health of dragons

381
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,599
Pay more attention when you prepare meals

382
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,839
Yao Ziliao

383
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,719
I've just been promoted to the table

384
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,119
Why don't you say congratulations

385
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,239
Why are you so narrow-minded

386
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,000
Is to remind you

387
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,400
Your Majesty's constitution should be light and his diet should be light

388
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,079
It is not advisable to use more night food

389
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,520
You just ingratiate yourself

390
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,640
Goose gizzard palm presented

391
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,280
Pickled pig's trotters and milk skin

392
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,040
They all hurt the dragon body

393
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,239
Moon flower

394
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,280
This world is very harsh on women

395
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,439
Once you take the shortcut,

396
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,680
The world will ignore your efforts and strength

397
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,800
Every step you take in the future

398
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,839
Can't get rid of the slander of gossip

399
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,119
You are excellent

400
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,000
Just keep your feet on the ground

401
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,040
I can't go to Nanjing

402
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,599
I have unfinished wishes

403
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,239
I can't go to Nanjing under any circumstances

404
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
I remember

405
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,800
You made the last vegetarian diet, didn't you

406
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,359
Children

407
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,359
Don't do this side-of-the-road thing in the future

408
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,880
Concentrate on cooking

409
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,880
Shortly after Wang Sishan returned home,

410
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,920
Was found hanging himself

411
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,119
This is her relic

412
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:52,920
Moon flower

413
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,760
This is the experience of cooking in my life

414
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,439
It's the only thing I can leave you

415
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
I hope you will one day

416
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,280
Realize one's long-cherished wish

417
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,400
Become the best kitchen in the world

418
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,079
Master

419
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:15,920
Meng's and Hu's

420
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,239
None of them deserve to cook food

421
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,800
You have a spirit in heaven

422
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,359
Please bless me

423
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,599
Get one's wish at an early date

424
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,119
Remote clearing

425
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,599
Don't blame me

426
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm sorry

427
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,400
Come

428
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,040
Father

429
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,439
Son, it's just in time

430
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,000
Taste delicious food with my father

431
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,880
It's the father

432
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,560
My son has a picture

433
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,520
I want to invite my father to enjoy it

434
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,040
Unfortunately, there was no chance in the past

435
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,520
Events in the world are also waiting after dinner

436
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:34,800
Yes

437
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,719
It's extremely crisp and rotten

438
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,400
Rare and rare

439
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,359
Father's pork is fat and greasy

440
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,439
It's better to eat less

441
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,119
Not in the way

442
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,439
What the prince said is extremely true

443
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,680
The so-called deficiency makes up for the cold and warms it

444
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,280
Warm the spleen and stomach with mutton in winter

445
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,800
It is timely to treat lung deficiency strain

446
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,760
You might as well try this mutton soup

447
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:18,680
Good

448
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,599
Have a taste together

449
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:27,680
Come

450
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,560
Yes

451
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,239
Eat

452
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
In the past, mutton smelled too heavy

453
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,800
Therefore, the chef will press it with heavy salt and taste

454
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,439
But this time the mutton

455
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,719
There is no smell of mutton at all

456
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:47,920
Why

457
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,520
The handmaiden specially added almonds and cooked them together

458
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,000
No wonder, no wonder

459
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
Your Majesty has used more meat recently

460
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,959
Why don't you use dandelion tea to get rid of the fire and moisten it

461
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,439
Your Majesty
free at kisskh.me

462
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,880
Scared me

463
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,439
Your Majesty

464
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,560
Your Majesty

465
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,319
Father

466
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,079
What's wrong

467
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,319
Bleeding

468
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,079
Who bleeds

469
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,920
Nose nose

470
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
My nose

471
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,400
I

472
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,079
Where do people come?

473
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Take these down

474
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,319
Father

475
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:29,839
Quick, quick, quick

476
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,359
Get these down quickly

477
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:32,599
Quickly

478
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,719
Quickly withdraw

479
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,119
Withdraw and withdraw

480
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,199
Your Majesty, this is overheating of lung qi

481
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,280
Will qi and blood go up and down

482
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,320
Don't move

483
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,000
Don't move

484
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,719
Why did the doctor's father suddenly have symptoms

485
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,560
His Royal Highness the Prince

486
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,399
Your Majesty's tongue coating is yellow and greasy, and his nose is hot and dry

487
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,120
And often thirsty

488
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,239
They are all signs of excessive lung fire

489
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,639
It is the thing that clears heat and cools blood on weekdays

490
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,239
Father, can you hear me

491
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,679
Meat and greasy food hurts the dragon body

492
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,080
Don't eat it in the future

493
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,439
Newspaper

494
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,840
Meng Shangshi, Shangshi Bureau

495
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,159
Let her in

496
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,320
Yes

497
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,239
I heard that your majesty is unwell

498
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,239
The handmaiden was deeply frightened

499
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,439
Specially prepare things for clearing heat and moistening lung

500
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,040
After the doctor saw it,

501
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,439
Please take it again

502
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,520
Is it delicious

503
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:31,760
Sweet

504
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,639
Not as sweet as you

505
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,239
Can you use medicated diet now

506
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,080
Get in

507
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,560
Guiling ointment nourishes yin, moistens lung, clears heat and removes fire

508
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,000
Appropriate to Your Majesty's physique

509
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,600
I wanted to boil this medicated diet before

510
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,320
It just takes about ten hours to cook this turtle shell

511
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm really afraid of delaying your majesty's illness

512
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,760
Or is Meng Shangshi thoughtful

513
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:13,879
It's a coincidence that the food bureau is thoughtful

514
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,520
Add two spoonfuls of honey

515
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,879
Yes

516
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,000
In the past, every summer

517
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,679
The palace always uses this thing to moisten dryness

518
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:31,199
His Royal Highness King Wei has always said that his throat is sore and hot recently

519
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,760
It was specially made by the Food Bureau for standby

520
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,439
I didn't expect it to come in handy

521
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,159
Father

522
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,840
Do you remember what you said to your son

523
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,000
Xuan Guo Guifei went to the temple

524
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Yes

525
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,919
Zhan Ji

526
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,800
Zhan Ji

527
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,159
Stand down, everybody

528
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,360
Your Majesty

529
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,479
Your Majesty

530
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,919
Your Majesty

531
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,840
Bearer

532
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,199
What are you doing

533
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,239
Empress, what are you doing, empress

534
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,159
Empress

535
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
What are you doing, Empress

536
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:53,760
Begin

537
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,320
Empress, I beg you not to

538
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,600
Don't destroy my hand

539
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,360
I beg you, empress

540
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,840
As a kitchen

541
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,719
You don't cook well

542
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,520
Wishful thinking all day long

543
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,959
Read climbing the dragon and attaching phoenix

544
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,199
Your hands

545
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,239
Nature can't stay

546
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,159
No

547
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,439
Just keep me

548
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,560
I don't think of anything anymore

549
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,959
I'm not doing anything

550
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,159
I don't want anything

551
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,719
I beg you, empress

552
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,360
Just keep my hands

553
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,280
I don't want anything

554
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:26,800
Don't, don't, empress

555
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,560
Handmaiden daring

556
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,879
Please ask the imperial concubine to forgive her

557
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,639
Yao canon meal

558
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,280
Don't rely on small credit to be so presumptuous

559
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,639
This is not your business

560
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,760
Imperial concubine empress, you promised the handmaiden

561
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
If the empress of the handmaiden gang sees your majesty again

562
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,280
Can you promise a handmaiden a wish

563
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,760
The handmaiden asked the empress to forgive her

564
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,280
Are your wishes wasted by doing so

565
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,919
Empress

566
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,399
Susi food has the dexterest hands in the world

567
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,439
Doesn't the empress appreciate it too

568
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,479
A sample of her restored Wangchuan map

569
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,120
In this world except her

570
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,159
No one else

571
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,719
Can restore such a delicate picture

572
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,760
Get out of the way

573
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,439
Please keep your promise

574
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:42,840
Help the handmaiden forgive her

575
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:51,320
Go

576
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,439
Why do you want to be stubborn

577
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,479
Be stubborn

578
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:30,040
I treat you as a bosom friend

579
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:32,719
And you only value that

580
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,679
Yin Ziping is useless

581
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:36,840
What's so good about her

582
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:39,000
I follow Master

583
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,199
I want to temper my skills well

584
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,320
She's just like you

585
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,199
For a man who is not worth it at all

586
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Do not hesitate to throw moths into the fire

587
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,760
Whatever I ask and what I want

588
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,800
It's all empty in the end

589
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,360
Why

590
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,879
With what

591
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,639
Moon flower

592
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,520
In any case

593
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,800
I won't even be grateful to you

594
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,280
I never begged you to save me

595
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,439
I didn't save you either

596
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,840
It was your hands that restored Wang Chuan Tu

597
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,560
Moon flower

598
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:27,959
As a kitchen

599
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,120
You must finally see the real chapter in the skill of cooking

600
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,840
I forgot to tell you
free at kisskh.me

601
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,080
The food list of the burning feast

602
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,439
I have tried it from beginning to end

603
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:42,600
What about you

604
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:44,520
How many more medical books have you memorized
