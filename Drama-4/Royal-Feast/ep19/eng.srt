1
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,800
Crown Princess, let me do it

2
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,080
You are slow

3
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm good at this

4
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,160
Your Highness Miss Yao, she

5
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,960
I told you not to mention this person

6
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,000
Out

7
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,199
Yes

8
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,399
Your Highness

9
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:55,919
Nothing

10
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,520
Your Highness is worried about King Wei's illness

11
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,759
Now the whole hospital is there

12
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,600
And what can happen

13
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,360
Your Highness is worried too much

14
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,600
Zi Jin

15
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,399
In order to save Meng Shangshi and Yin Ziping,

16
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,360
Willing to bear the responsibility of the staff

17
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,839
Is it worth it

18
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,520
Do what you have to do

19
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,520
Save the person who should be saved

20
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,759
Whatever the consequences

21
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,440
I am willing to accept it

22
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,440
What is it worth? Is it worth it

23
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,240
Miyagi's staff can be very tight

24
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,199
I told them just now

25
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,640
The Empress does not want to see you again

26
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,880
Can you make it

27
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,360
It's not too late for you to regret it now

28
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,199
I will ask the Empress to drive you out of the palace

29
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,039
Leave you alive

30
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,119
Didn't you send the eunuch who killed people

31
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,759
By mistake, I was allowed to escape

32
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,640
It's now

33
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,319
Why do you say anything against your will

34
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:14,160
I don't want to see you die with my own eyes

35
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,559
It's just

36
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,559
It's fate

37
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,520
Take a few sticks

38
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:52,680
Only six sticks

39
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,599
You can't stand just six sticks

40
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,360
Four more sticks

41
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
There will be no more you in the world

42
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,080
As long as you bow your head and beg for mercy

43
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Say you are wrong

44
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,120
This cane

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,280
You can get through it alive

46
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,960
Dare to ask my Lord

47
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,960
What's wrong with me

48
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,039
Clearly familiar with things

49
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,120
See through the evil of human nature

50
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,439
But I still risked my own life to save others

51
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,759
Isn't that wrong enough

52
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,680
If you don't know how to look back

53
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,840
Even if I save you once,

54
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,360
Soon you will make the same mistake again

55
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,439
And I never save people who take the initiative to die

56
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,560
Continue

57
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:17,800
Be ungrateful

58
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,240
Your Excellency

59
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,919
It looks soft and weak

60
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,159
Who knew the gas was so big

61
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,719
Your Excellency

62
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,759
Such a disobedient woman dies when she dies

63
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,759
Why keep it in mind

64
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,840
Find your own way to death

65
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,280
Telling you again and again

66
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,039
Why don't you listen to advice

67
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:38,199
Your Excellency

68
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:42,280
Stop

69
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,400
Girl, you just have to say

70
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:56,840
Your Highness will save you naturally

71
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,719
Thank you for your kindness

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
And two sticks

73
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,800
I can stand it

74
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,800
You don't have to plead

75
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,560
Even if you look up at your highness,

76
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,400
Even if it's soft

77
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,039
Your Highness, this

78
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Continue

79
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,159
Continue

80
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,719
Your Highness has already prescribed medicine for Yao's palm meal

81
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,160
Seasonal medicine

82
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,119
The medicine she takes every day

83
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,439
It's all suffered by you yourself

84
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,480
And then send it to Shangshi Bureau

85
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:10,960
Yes

86
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,480
I don't want to be your concubine

87
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,679
I don't want to live for you all my life

88
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,480
I don't want to be a puppet around others.

89
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,040
Your Highness

90
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,920
Why don't you show up when you help people

91
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,119
Your Highness, don't you want to face

92
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
It involves Wei Wang

93
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,520
It's time to find out

94
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,319
As for her life or death, what do I have to do with it

95
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:29,319
Your Highness is absolutely right

96
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,840
Where's the man you're looking for

97
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,679
Someone has been invited

98
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,679
Father

99
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,799
I hope this time you

100
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,759
Don't let my son down again

101
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,280
You're awake

102
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,280
I'll help you

103
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:04,960
Help her out

104
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,319
Yes

105
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,640
Come

106
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,280
I hold you

107
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,280
Thank you very much

108
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Handmaiden visits empress

109
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,559
Do you remember what I said to you

110
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,679
Never forget for life

111
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
Why do you redress others' grievances

112
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,960
Do not hesitate to endure such suffering

113
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,160
Back to the empress's words

114
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,799
That's nobody else

115
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,879
It is an adult who teaches handmaiden cooking

116
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,520
And close friends

117
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:28,999
You want to redress your grievances

118
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,759
Where is the evidence

119
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,239
Empress Empress

120
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,359
When cooking, the handmaiden was not in the kitchen

121
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,319
But the handmaiden knows

122
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,400
From Choosing Vegetables to Making Meals

123
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,439
The food bureau has strict regulations

124
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,199
There will be no such mistakes

125
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,359
The Empress is asking you for evidence

126
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,080
Handmaiden has no evidence

127
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,799
Empress Empress

128
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,640
There is an important sentence that must be reported in person

129
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,920
No matter what the cause of His Royal Highness, King Wei

130
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,480
This time, the empress can't get away with it

131
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,679
Why

132
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,520
Cooking time

133
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,759
The Queen once sent people to the dining room

134
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,239
Who are you talking about

135
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,080
Your Majesty, you know well

136
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,080
Why ask male and female servants and concubines

137
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,559
Bold

138
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,080
Your Majesty

139
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,960
The past is vivid in my mind

140
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,720
You are the king of a country

141
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,559
Naturally, she dare not blame you

142
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,439
She is putting all her hatred

143
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,080
It's all recorded in the male and female servants

144
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,679
To begin

145
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,640
Just come at me

146
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,999
Ayan

147
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,080
Ayan, he is still a child

148
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,239
How can she be ruthless

149
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,840
Guo Guifei said just now

150
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,720
Who gave the hand to King Wei

151
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,160
Your Majesty's handmaiden is dead

152
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,480
Failed to stop the empress

153
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,640
Since the imperial concubine has doubts,

154
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,840
Why don't you confront me face to face

155
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,520
Your Majesty

156
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,999
How is Wei Wang's condition

157
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,799
What did the doctor say

158
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,879
When will the child wake up

159
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,999
Don't touch him

160
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,199
Empress Empress

161
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:55,160
The other day

162
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,439
I listened to what others said

163
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,840
Almost lead to great disaster

164
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,720
But I pleaded guilty to you again and again afterwards

165
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,520
Even if you have resentment

166
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,759
You have to take care of your majesty, too

167
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:13,679
Your Majesty

168
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,480
The imperial concubine has no evidence and speculates

169
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,199
You can't believe it at all

170
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Your Majesty

171
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,679
Xuan Sheng Tai Yi

172
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,319
Sheng Yin, a quack, has repeatedly broken the ban

173
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,080
I have already dismissed him

174
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,720
Don't talk about him again in the future

175
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,319
Your Majesty

176
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,359
Would you rather trust a bunch of quacks

177
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,679
And dismiss the man who saved your wife's life

178
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,239
Prince Prince and Princess arrived

179
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,600
Father

180
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Shengyin is not far from Beijing

181
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,239
My son has urgently ordered him to return to Beijing

182
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,400
Diagnosis and treatment for Xiaoshi

183
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,640
Zhu Zhanji

184
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,480
Who allowed you to be so rebellious

185
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,239
Your Majesty, please allow my daughter-in-law to feel the pulse of King Wei

186
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:18,759
Go ahead

187
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,400
You

188
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,920
What are you going to do

189
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,319
Don't you touch my son

190
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,280
Your Majesty

191
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,319
Zhu Zhanji

192
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,280
Do you want to take your brother's life

193
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,239
His Royal Highness the Prince

194
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,319
Tai Hospital has already made a conclusion

195
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,840
His Royal Highness King Wei was poisoned

196
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Will be unconscious

197
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,559
Why should you make your majesty angry again

198
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,759
Father

199
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,319
Ayan is not you

200
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm not a second uncle either

201
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,679
You

202
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,799
Ayan is my own brother

203
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,920
I won't let anyone hurt him

204
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:56,400
What do you mean

205
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,960
I am Ayan's biological mother

206
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,840
Am I going to hurt him

207
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,920
Your Majesty

208
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,720
King Wei is really not poisoned

209
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
It's exogenous rheumatism and fire toxin that gives birth to back gangrene

210
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,720
What are you talking about

211
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,720
Just now, Dai Yuan judged clearly that

212
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,239
Wei Wang is because he ate it

213
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,439
Unpoisoned antler

214
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,319
Are you sure

215
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,640
Bearer

216
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,520
Arrest Dai Yuan's sentence and torture him

217
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,040
Yes

218
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,559
Zhu Zhanji

219
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,160
How dare you give orders when I am here

220
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,239
Father

221
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,599
Dorsal gangrene can endanger life

222
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,040
Dai Yuan was sentenced to old eyes again

223
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,119
How can it not be diagnosed

224
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:50,040
Unless someone wants to deliberately conceal Xiao Shi's illness

225
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,879
You

226
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,599
Your Majesty, he

227
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,359
Father

228
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,200
Dai Yuan was sentenced to deceiving the superior and deceiving the inferior

229
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,680
According to your wisdom

230
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,239
How can you think of the key

231
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,560
It's just partial listening and partial believing

232
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,440
Your Majesty

233
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,239
You can't believe this heart-wrenching statement

234
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,200
Back gangrene can kill a child at any time

235
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,920
You're still here arguing

236
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,239
Kwok, are you still worthy of being a mother

237
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,079
I

238
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,759
Father, Xiao Shi, I want to take it away

239
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,239
In my palace to recuperate

240
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,079
As for the Imperial Concubine

241
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,560
She is your concubine

242
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,079
It is inconvenient for children to interfere

243
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,320
Xiao Shi

244
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:39,999
Come

245
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:41,959
Get up

246
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:44,560
Ayan

247
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,640
Ayan

248
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,200
Your Majesty

249
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,239
Your Majesty

250
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,119
Your Majesty

251
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,200
Your Majesty

252
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,119
You get up and drive

253
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,879
Ayan

254
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,839
Ayan

255
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,759
Come

256
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,280
Crown Princess

257
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,920
Out

258
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
I want to know the secret in her heart now

259
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,040
Quack

260
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,200
So afraid of taking a pulse

261
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,200
Why didn't you tell me what happened in the first place

262
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,479
Your Highness

263
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,520
My body knows it's wrong

264
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,599
I'm sorry

265
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,920
Okay, I got it

266
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,440
I don't know what I did wrong

267
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,079
Why won't the Queen see me

268
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,599
Do you know that

269
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,040
Yao Ziliao met the Empress that day

270
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,359
What did she say

271
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,719
She said

272
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,920
It's hard to excuse the Queen's involvement

273
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,200
What else is there

274
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,479
On the day of the incident

275
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,359
Hu Shangshi was the first to identify antler as poisonous

276
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,520
Will involve a lot of right and wrong

277
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,839
This is a misunderstanding

278
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,520
I didn't expect it at all

279
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,920
Guo Guifei will treat Wei Wang's illness

280
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,320
Write it down to the empress

281
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,640
You naturally spare no effort to fight against dissidents

282
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,920
It's a pity that it's stupid to involve the Lord

283
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,560
Empress has a purport

284
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,079
I have made a mistake of talking too much

285
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:39,959
Kneeling right here

286
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,719
Kneel until dawn tomorrow

287
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,320
Seasonal medicine

288
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,599
What about purple duckweed

289
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,320
Haven't you come back yet

290
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,479
You finally woke up after two days of lethargy

291
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,040
Rest assured

292
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,479
Since it is proved that your highness was born with gangrene,

293
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,359
Not poisoning

294
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:35,759
Will come back sooner or later

295
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,959
Yao palm meal

296
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,200
Yao palm meal

297
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,920
The Crown Princess ordered you to deliver food

298
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,239
Crown Princess

299
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,719
The handmaiden was ordered to deliver the meal

300
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,839
Do you know why I'm punishing you

301
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,999
You warn the queen

302
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,320
The surface is to remind the empress

303
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,320
In fact, it is excusing the Shang Food Bureau

304
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,119
But why did you say that second sentence

305
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,479
Hu Shang Shi

306
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,280
It's just rejected by the empress

307
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:46,839
So ah

308
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,520
I'm just

309
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,440
Is to make you kneel for half an hour

310
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,560
All right

311
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,200
You can go now

312
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,079
This game

313
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,400
After all, I won

314
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:39,280
Zi Jin

315
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm okay

316
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,119
I want to go in and have a rest

317
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,640
Injured

318
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,800
And said no

319
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,839
I saw it all

320
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:25,759
Take your hands out

321
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,040
Let me check

322
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,239
What are you doing

323
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,040
Hold out your hand

324
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,920
Where else is it hurt

325
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:39,520
Leg

326
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,079
I said I'm fine. Get up

327
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,359
You let me have a look. Come on

328
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,079
Who told you to express your feelings to the queen

329
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,479
Gong Zhengsi's staff responsibility

330
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,839
Is that what you can stand

331
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,280
Do you know that

332
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,879
Do you realize that you almost died yourself

333
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,320
That's enough

334
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,839
Don't cry

335
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,079
Look

336
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,759
Am I alive and well now

337
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,079
The Queen won't kill me yet

338
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,479
Who

339
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,879
You come back, come back

340
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:32,400
Don't cry

341
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:34,999
I'm not crying

342
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,239
You're not crying yet

343
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,440
As soon as I came back, I heard that you went to Qingning Palace

344
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,040
Why are you so stupid

345
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,479
To give up the crown prince

346
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,239
You sympathize with others everywhere

347
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,520
Why don't you pity yourself

348
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,320
All right

349
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,560
You cry so ugly

350
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,400
Purple Azolla

351
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,800
They are all poor people, too

352
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:20,999
We have to fight each other

353
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
Isn't it more pathetic

354
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,680
I only let it happen once

355
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,440
Just this once

356
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,640
Okay

357
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,999
All right, stop crying

358
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,400
His Royal Highness the King of Wei His Royal Highness the King of Wei

359
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,999
It's not ready to start yet

360
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:49,400
Be obedient

361
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,079
Start and open

362
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,119
You can't go to the fields yet

363
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,200
Be obedient and obedient

364
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,160
Your Highness

365
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,680
It'll be ready in a minute

366
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,959
You can't go to the fields yet

367
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:56,959
His Royal Highness King Wei

368
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,400
Zhan, what are you doing again

369
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,839
I've been ill for so long

370
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,680
Why didn't my mother come to see me

371
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,879
I want to see my mother

372
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:04,400
I'm going back soon

373
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,680
Nonsense

374
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:08,359
Go back

375
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,079
Sheng Taiyi worked hard

376
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,680
Your Highness has spoken heavily

377
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,920
This is the responsibility of Wei Chen

378
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,920
Sheng Taiyi's prescription about Wei Wang in these two days

379
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,959
I was just about to ask you for advice

380
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,680
Yes

381
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,079
Xiao Shi

382
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,079
Who allowed you to fool around like this

383
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,560
Brother, is my mother a bad woman

384
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,079
Who said that

385
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,160
Everyone says she is a bad woman

386
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,680
To frame the Queen

387
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,800
Put my life at risk

388
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,359
Do you mean it

389
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,959
Now my father is angry

390
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,759
Even he doesn't want me

391
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,839
You won't come to see me, will you

392
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,079
When you're asleep

393
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,959
Father has been here long ago

394
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
It's just that he has something important to discuss now

395
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,879
As for your mother concubine

396
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,520
When you are seriously ill,

397
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,440
She went to the temple to pray for you

398
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,359
That's why I couldn't be with you

399
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,040
Really

400
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,040
When you are well,

401
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,440
Naturally, you will know whether it is true or false

402
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,839
But

403
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,440
If you keep being so disobedient,

404
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,800
I got angry.

405
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,560
That big brother will wait for me to get well

406
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,200
Don't forget what you promised me

407
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
I'm going to release the eagle

408
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,440
I also want to go hunting

409
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,440
It's just

410
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:39,440
Rest assured

411
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,440
Big Brother will find the best doctor in the world

412
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,359
Treat you

413
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,560
When you're ready

414
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,359
Big Brother will take you hunting

415
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,320
Your Highness, I can't help it either

416
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:01,440
His Royal Highness the King of Wei refused to eat

417
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,160
I have to go on asking questions

418
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,320
I this

419
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,680
It can only be like this

420
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,599
Your Highness, I won't dare next time

421
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,560
There is too much gossip in your highness's palace

422
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,560
If someone intends to sow discord,

423
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,879
On the contrary, I will misunderstand you and the empress

424
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,200
It is better to tell the facts in advance

425
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,680
So as not to hurt brotherhood

426
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Guo Guifei has thousands of mistakes

427
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,680
She is also Ayan's mother

428
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,560
How can you say this to a child

429
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:30,560
Even if you want to say

430
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,440
I will say it myself after recovery

431
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,320
Who allowed you to make your own decisions

432
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,959
Your Highness, the handmaiden knew he was wrong

433
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,280
Handmaiden never dared again

434
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Your Highness, I will never dare again

435
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:41,879
Handmaiden knows wrong

436
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,959
You can go. You won't be needed in the future

437
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:50,440
Your Highness, the handmaiden followed you when he was six years old

438
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,560
You are my God

439
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,520
Where do you want me to go

440
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:53,959
After you let me go

441
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,160
How can I stand on a cone

442
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,839
The handmaiden is wrong. The handmaiden is wrong

443
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,119
Handmaiden never dared again

444
00:32:59,119 --> 00:32:59,999
Never again, Your Highness

445
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,759
Yuan Qi is also dedicated to thinking of his master

446
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,599
Will do something wrong

447
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,920
Why don't you spare him for my sake

448
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:05,959
Yuan Qi

449
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,959
In the future, you should be careful not to do it again

450
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,400
Handmaiden never dared again

451
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,560
If you do it again

452
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,680
He cut off the handmaiden's tongue

453
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,119
Go and get forty sticks

454
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,119
Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you, Your Highness

455
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,879
Get up quickly

456
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,800
Handmaiden will never forget the great kindness of the Crown Princess

457
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,239
Come

458
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:50,359
Right

459
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,200
Xiao Shi

460
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:33,119
From now on

461
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,999
Yao Ziliao was officially promoted to Canon Food

462
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,920
Yin Ziping is in charge of food

463
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,400
You should do your job well in the future

464
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,079
Yes

465
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,440
Han Ying's sister

466
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
Let me see Meng Shang again

467
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,680
Don't transfer me to Shanglinyuan

468
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,680
I don't want to go there

469
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,680
Meng Shangshi, please don't drive me away

470
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,599
Meng Shang Shi Please Meng Shang Shi

471
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,359
Please, Meng Shangshi

472
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,319
Please, please

473
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,359
Do me a favor

474
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,400
Do me a favor

475
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,480
Please help me. Help me

476
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Dare to ask Meng Shangshi

477
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,640
What fault did she make when she heard the canon meal

478
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:10,680
You're gonna kick her out

479
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,319
Meritorious service should be rewarded and punished

480
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,760
Can define merits and demerits in the future

481
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,680
I am the only one in the food bureau

482
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,599
Do you all understand

483
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,240
Yes

484
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,440
According to Meng Shang's overbearing temper,

485
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,760
Get rid of Wen Yantao and don't even find a reason

486
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,000
Those who go up to intercede now

487
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,559
There must be no good fruit to eat

488
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,720
That's enough

489
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,599
Wen Yantao is eager for quick success and instant benefit

490
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,160
When Meng Shangshi was in trouble,

491
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,680
She also deliberately made things difficult

492
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,119
She was transferred to Shanglinyuan at this time

493
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,000
Maybe it's a good thing

494
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,920
Now Hu Shangshi has lost the support of the Queen

495
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,720
Is to lose the greatest dependence

496
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,519
People who take refuge in her in various departments

497
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,480
Be denounced one by one

498
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:02,680
You guess

499
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,599
Who will be the next person to be deported

500
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,160
All right

501
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,519
Zihao, I finally became a palm meal

502
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,160
I'm on the palm. I'm on the palm

503
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,920
I am the palm meal

504
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,400
It's all like this

505
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,200
Don't you find another backer

506
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,640
If it weren't for Monteggia

507
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,440
Master can't be expelled from the palace

508
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:02,680
I will never take refuge in the enemy

509
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,839
Besides, it's not at the end of its tether

510
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,039
Why should you be so discouraged

511
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,359
You don't want to watch helplessly

512
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,519
Watch the Shang Food Bureau fall back into the hands of Meng

513
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,000
In this case

514
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:30,440
Please wait patiently for the opportunity

515
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,039
Please invite the imperial concubine to dinner

516
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,279
The Queen is involved in this matter

517
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,119
I don't want to save you

518
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,960
You face me now

519
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,680
There is no resentment at all

520
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,440
Why

521
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,839
Please treat the empress to dinner

522
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,839
Answer me

523
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,079
The imperial concubine did not give real trust

524
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,640
Will be defeated so easily

525
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:12,799
What's the use of grief at this point

526
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,079
Why don't you think about how to recover?

527
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,640
Dai Yuan has been sentenced to prison

528
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,200
A real disaster

529
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,519
It's just around the corner

530
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,039
Empress

531
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:31,279
It's better to fight hard than to wait and die

532
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,079
If the empress is willing to give me real trust

533
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,760
I will help you tide over the difficulties

534
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,079
Wei Wang has recovered his health

535
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,279
Just listlessness, poor appetite

536
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,720
His Royal Highness is very worried

537
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,480
Life is still in the food bureau, and everyone shows their strengths

538
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,720
Be sure to let Wei Wang resume eating

539
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:56,680
Yes

540
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
Meng Shangshi's orders just now

541
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,920
Everybody hear me clearly

542
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,760
No matter what method is used,

543
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,160
Be sure to coax King Wei to eat

544
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,599
Well done, the East Palace is rewarded

545
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,359
If you don't do well, you can't escape punishment from top to bottom.

546
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,559
Go quickly

547
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,640
Yes

548
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:30,599
Jade, can you help me put that

549
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,760
Yao canon meal

550
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,440
What meal are you going to prepare for King Wei

551
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,720
Shall I help you

552
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,359
No need

553
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,359
Since I decided to stay in the still food bureau,

554
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,760
It is inevitable that there will be a contest between you and me

555
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,599
But do you know that

556
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,680
I started entering the kitchen when I was five years old

557
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,720
Practice day and night every day

558
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,640
Can you argue with me

559
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,760
Want to be a good cook

560
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,640
Let the world see the beauty of Chinese drinking

561
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:47,640
Do it if you want to

562
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,480
Famous chefs in the Forbidden City

563
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,079
And the chef of the rich and wealthy

564
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,760
Street restaurants

565
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,559
A mother who cooks in a poor family

566
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,720
Don't they all do the same thing

567
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,119
Divided into 369 for no reason

568
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,839
It is also necessary to make judgments

569
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,440
This kind of state of mind has fallen into the lower multiplication

570
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,680
Why don't you understand

571
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,720
To put it bluntly, it's no better than

572
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,480
Fuck off

573
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,480
Vulgar and unbearable

574
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:25,839
Why are you so late

575
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:31,599
Wei Wang summoned

576
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,960
This is

577
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,480
Handmaiden heard

578
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,640
Chrysanthemum into Pu'er can treat furuncle and swelling

579
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,359
It can also clear fire and improve eyesight

580
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
It is of great benefit to the health of His Royal Highness King Wei

581
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,960
That's why I dared to give it a try

582
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,760
His Royal Highness King Wei

583
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:07,559
To suit your taste

584
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,680
The handmaiden also specially added a little rock sugar

585
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,720
It can eliminate the bitterness of chrysanthemums

586
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,000
Take a sip

587
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:21,359
Try this crystal sweet-scented osmanthus cake

588
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,319
Osmanthus fragrans are picked by handmaidens

589
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,519
I hear that you often feel your heart burning

590
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,839
And sore throat

591
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,519
This can alleviate

592
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:34,200
Or would you like to try steamed crab dumplings

593
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:36,680
Your Highness, eat one

594
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,160
I don't want to eat

595
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,440
Your Highness

596
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,400
Let's have a bite of crab dumplings

597
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
Look at this crab dumpling

598
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
This skin is so thin

599
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,160
You can see the crab meat inside

600
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,000
Every one is so full

601
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:51,279
Particularly delicious

602
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,559
Come and have a bite

603
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:53,640
Take a bite

604
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,480
I don't eat I don't eat

605
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,680
I just don't eat

606
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,119
Good, good, don't eat, don't eat

607
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,160
And sugar egg powder

608
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,440
Crisp, crisp, sweet and delicious

609
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Ensure that the entrance is melted

610
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,920
Eat it in your mouth

611
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,960
Can bite very delicate sugar silk

612
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,760
The mouth is full of thick egg fragrance

613
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:17,720
This is a minister

614
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,680
The sweetest and crispest cake you have ever eaten

615
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:21,720
Your Highness

616
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,559
I won't eat it

617
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,319
Your Highness

618
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,599
Your Highness, calm down. Your Highness, calm down

619
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:27,079
Your Highness, calm down

620
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,400
Your Highness, this is called shrimp

621
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,879
Please taste it, Your Highness

622
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,240
Your Highness and this

623
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,599
Look how fun it is

624
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,200
Eat one

625
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,000
Are you juggling

626
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,680
To coax me in such a ridiculous way

627
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,640
Take it all away

628
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:53,760
Take it all away

629
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,200
Your Highness

630
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:57,839
Shrimp with unique flavor, handmaiden dares to offer it

631
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,000
Handmaiden is guilty. Please forgive your highness

632
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,400
Your Highness is not angry

633
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,160
Not angry

634
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,000
Your Highness

635
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,039
Please taste it, Your Highness

636
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,559
Your Highness, look, this hedgehog is small

637
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,039
But it needs to be cut enough for 120 scissors

638
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,680
Bold

639
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,839
Your Highness has said everything

640
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,640
Are you conjuring your highness
