1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Crown Princess, let me do it

2
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,440
You are slow

3
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,360
I'm good at this

4
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,520
Your Highness Miss Yao, she

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,320
I told you not to mention this person

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,360
Out

7
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,559
Yes

8
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,759
Your Highness

9
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,279
Nothing

10
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
Your Highness is worried about King Wei's illness

11
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,119
Now the whole hospital is there

12
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:28,960
And what can happen

13
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
Your Highness is worried too much

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Zi Jin

15
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,759
In order to save Meng Shangshi and Yin Ziping,

16
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,720
Willing to bear the responsibility of the staff

17
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,199
Is it worth it

18
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,880
Do what you have to do

19
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,880
Save the person who should be saved

20
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,119
Whatever the consequences

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
I am willing to accept it

22
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,800
What is it worth? Is it worth it

23
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,600
Miyagi's staff can be very tight

24
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,559
I told them just now

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,000
The Empress does not want to see you again

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Can you make it

27
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,720
It's not too late for you to regret it now

28
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,559
I will ask the Empress to drive you out of the palace

29
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,399
Leave you alive

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,479
Didn't you send the eunuch who killed people

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,119
By mistake, I was allowed to escape

32
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
It's now

33
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,679
Why do you say anything against your will

34
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,520
I don't want to see you die with my own eyes

35
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,919
It's just

36
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,919
It's fate

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
Take a few sticks

38
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,040
Only six sticks

39
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,959
You can't stand just six sticks

40
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
Four more sticks

41
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,040
There will be no more you in the world

42
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,440
As long as you bow your head and beg for mercy

43
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Say you are wrong

44
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,480
This cane

45
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
You can get through it alive

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
Dare to ask my Lord

47
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,320
What's wrong with me

48
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,399
Clearly familiar with things

49
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,480
See through the evil of human nature

50
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,799
But I still risked my own life to save others

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,119
Isn't that wrong enough

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
If you don't know how to look back

53
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,200
Even if I save you once,

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,720
Soon you will make the same mistake again

55
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,799
And I never save people who take the initiative to die

56
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:41,920
Continue

57
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,160
Be ungrateful

58
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,600
Your Excellency

59
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,279
It looks soft and weak

60
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,519
Who knew the gas was so big

61
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,079
Your Excellency

62
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:58,119
Such a disobedient woman dies when she dies

63
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,119
Why keep it in mind

64
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,200
Find your own way to death

65
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,640
Telling you again and again

66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,399
Why don't you listen to advice

67
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,559
Your Excellency

68
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,640
Stop

69
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,760
Girl, you just have to say

70
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,200
Your Highness will save you naturally

71
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,079
Thank you for your kindness

72
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
And two sticks

73
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,160
I can stand it

74
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
You don't have to plead

75
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,920
Even if you look up at your highness,

76
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
Even if it's soft

77
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,399
Your Highness, this

78
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,600
Continue

79
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:00,519
Continue

80
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,079
Your Highness has already prescribed medicine for Yao's palm meal

81
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Seasonal medicine

82
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,479
The medicine she takes every day

83
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,799
It's all suffered by you yourself

84
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,840
And then send it to Shangshi Bureau

85
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes

86
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,840
I don't want to be your concubine

87
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,039
I don't want to live for you all my life

88
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,840
I don't want to be a puppet around others.

89
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,400
Your Highness

90
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,280
Why don't you show up when you help people

91
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,479
Your Highness, don't you want to face

92
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
It involves Wei Wang

93
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
It's time to find out

94
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,679
As for her life or death, what do I have to do with it

95
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,679
Your Highness is absolutely right

96
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Where's the man you're looking for

97
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,039
Someone has been invited

98
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,039
Father

99
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,159
I hope this time you

100
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,119
Don't let my son down again

101
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,640
You're awake

102
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,640
I'll help you

103
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,320
Help her out

104
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,679
Yes

105
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,000
Come

106
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
I hold you

107
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,640
Thank you very much

108
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Handmaiden visits empress

109
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,919
Do you remember what I said to you

110
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,039
Never forget for life

111
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,320
Why do you redress others' grievances

112
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,320
Do not hesitate to endure such suffering

113
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Back to the empress's words

114
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,159
That's nobody else

115
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,239
It is an adult who teaches handmaiden cooking

116
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,880
And close friends

117
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,359
You want to redress your grievances

118
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,119
Where is the evidence

119
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,599
Empress Empress

120
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,719
When cooking, the handmaiden was not in the kitchen

121
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,679
But the handmaiden knows

122
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,760
From Choosing Vegetables to Making Meals

123
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,799
The food bureau has strict regulations

124
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,559
There will be no such mistakes

125
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,719
The Empress is asking you for evidence

126
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,440
Handmaiden has no evidence

127
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,159
Empress Empress

128
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,000
There is an important sentence that must be reported in person

129
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,280
No matter what the cause of His Royal Highness, King Wei

130
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,840
This time, the empress can't get away with it

131
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,039
Why

132
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,880
Cooking time

133
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,119
The Queen once sent people to the dining room

134
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,599
Who are you talking about

135
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,440
Your Majesty, you know well

136
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,440
Why ask male and female servants and concubines

137
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,919
Bold

138
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,440
Your Majesty

139
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,320
The past is vivid in my mind

140
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,080
You are the king of a country

141
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,919
Naturally, she dare not blame you

142
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,799
She is putting all her hatred

143
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,440
It's all recorded in the male and female servants

144
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,039
To begin

145
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,000
Just come at me

146
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,359
Ayan

147
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
Ayan, he is still a child

148
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,599
How can she be ruthless

149
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,200
Guo Guifei said just now

150
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,080
Who gave the hand to King Wei

151
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,520
Your Majesty's handmaiden is dead

152
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
Failed to stop the empress

153
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,000
Since the imperial concubine has doubts,

154
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,200
Why don't you confront me face to face

155
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,880
Your Majesty

156
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,359
How is Wei Wang's condition

157
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,159
What did the doctor say

158
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,239
When will the child wake up

159
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,359
Don't touch him

160
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,559
Empress Empress

161
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,520
The other day

162
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,799
I listened to what others said

163
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,200
Almost lead to great disaster

164
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,080
But I pleaded guilty to you again and again afterwards

165
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,880
Even if you have resentment

166
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,119
You have to take care of your majesty, too

167
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,039
Your Majesty

168
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,840
The imperial concubine has no evidence and speculates

169
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,559
You can't believe it at all

170
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Your Majesty

171
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,039
Xuan Sheng Tai Yi

172
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,679
Sheng Yin, a quack, has repeatedly broken the ban

173
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
I have already dismissed him

174
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,080
Don't talk about him again in the future

175
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:15,679
Your Majesty

176
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,719
Would you rather trust a bunch of quacks

177
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,039
And dismiss the man who saved your wife's life

178
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,599
Prince Prince and Princess arrived

179
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,960
Father

180
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Shengyin is not far from Beijing

181
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,599
My son has urgently ordered him to return to Beijing

182
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,760
Diagnosis and treatment for Xiaoshi

183
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,000
Zhu Zhanji

184
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,840
Who allowed you to be so rebellious

185
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,599
Your Majesty, please allow my daughter-in-law to feel the pulse of King Wei

186
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,119
Go ahead

187
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,760
You

188
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,280
What are you going to do

189
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,679
Don't you touch my son

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,640
Your Majesty

191
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,679
Zhu Zhanji

192
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,640
Do you want to take your brother's life

193
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,599
His Royal Highness the Prince

194
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,679
Tai Hospital has already made a conclusion

195
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,200
His Royal Highness King Wei was poisoned

196
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Will be unconscious

197
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,919
Why should you make your majesty angry again

198
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,119
Father

199
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,679
Ayan is not you

200
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm not a second uncle either

201
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,039
You

202
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,159
Ayan is my own brother

203
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
I won't let anyone hurt him

204
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,760
What do you mean

205
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,320
I am Ayan's biological mother

206
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,200
Am I going to hurt him

207
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,280
Your Majesty

208
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,080
King Wei is really not poisoned

209
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,000
It's exogenous rheumatism and fire toxin that gives birth to back gangrene

210
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,080
What are you talking about

211
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,080
Just now, Dai Yuan judged clearly that

212
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,599
Wei Wang is because he ate it

213
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,799
Unpoisoned antler

214
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,679
Are you sure

215
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,000
Bearer

216
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,880
Arrest Dai Yuan's sentence and torture him

217
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes

218
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,919
Zhu Zhanji

219
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,520
How dare you give orders when I am here

220
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,599
Father

221
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,959
Dorsal gangrene can endanger life

222
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
Dai Yuan was sentenced to old eyes again

223
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,479
How can it not be diagnosed

224
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,400
Unless someone wants to deliberately conceal Xiao Shi's illness

225
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,239
You

226
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,959
Your Majesty, he

227
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,719
Father

228
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,560
Dai Yuan was sentenced to deceiving the superior and deceiving the inferior

229
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,040
According to your wisdom

230
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,599
How can you think of the key

231
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
It's just partial listening and partial believing

232
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,800
Your Majesty

233
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,599
You can't believe this heart-wrenching statement

234
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,560
Back gangrene can kill a child at any time

235
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,280
You're still here arguing

236
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,599
Kwok, are you still worthy of being a mother

237
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,439
I

238
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,119
Father, Xiao Shi, I want to take it away

239
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,599
In my palace to recuperate

240
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,439
As for the Imperial Concubine

241
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,920
She is your concubine

242
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,439
It is inconvenient for children to interfere

243
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,680
Xiao Shi

244
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,359
Come

245
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,319
Get up

246
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:11,920
Ayan

247
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Ayan

248
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,560
Your Majesty

249
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,599
Your Majesty

250
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,479
Your Majesty

251
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:23,560
Your Majesty

252
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,479
You get up and drive

253
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,239
Ayan

254
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,199
Ayan

255
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,119
Come

256
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:34,640
Crown Princess

257
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,280
Out

258
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
I want to know the secret in her heart now

259
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,400
Quack

260
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,560
So afraid of taking a pulse

261
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,560
Why didn't you tell me what happened in the first place

262
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,839
Your Highness

263
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
My body knows it's wrong

264
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:02,959
I'm sorry

265
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
Okay, I got it

266
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:29,800
I don't know what I did wrong

267
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,439
Why won't the Queen see me

268
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,959
Do you know that

269
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,400
Yao Ziliao met the Empress that day

270
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,719
What did she say

271
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,079
She said

272
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,280
It's hard to excuse the Queen's involvement

273
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,560
What else is there

274
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:46,839
On the day of the incident

275
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,719
Hu Shangshi was the first to identify antler as poisonous

276
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,880
Will involve a lot of right and wrong

277
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,199
This is a misunderstanding

278
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,880
I didn't expect it at all

279
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,280
Guo Guifei will treat Wei Wang's illness

280
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,680
Write it down to the empress

281
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,000
You naturally spare no effort to fight against dissidents

282
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,280
It's a pity that it's stupid to involve the Lord

283
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:04,920
Empress has a purport

284
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,439
I have made a mistake of talking too much

285
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,319
Kneeling right here

286
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,079
Kneel until dawn tomorrow

287
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
Seasonal medicine

288
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,959
What about purple duckweed

289
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,680
Haven't you come back yet

290
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,839
You finally woke up after two days of lethargy

291
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,400
Rest assured

292
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,839
Since it is proved that your highness was born with gangrene,

293
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,719
Not poisoning

294
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,119
Will come back sooner or later

295
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,319
Yao palm meal

296
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,560
Yao palm meal

297
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,280
The Crown Princess ordered you to deliver food

298
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,599
Crown Princess

299
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,079
The handmaiden was ordered to deliver the meal

300
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,199
Do you know why I'm punishing you

301
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,359
You warn the queen

302
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,680
The surface is to remind the empress

303
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:05,680
In fact, it is excusing the Shang Food Bureau

304
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,479
But why did you say that second sentence

305
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,839
Hu Shang Shi

306
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,640
It's just rejected by the empress

307
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,199
So ah

308
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:15,880
I'm just

309
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,800
Is to make you kneel for half an hour

310
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,920
All right

311
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,560
You can go now

312
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,439
This game

313
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,760
After all, I won

314
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,640
Zi Jin

315
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:15,800
I'm okay

316
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,479
I want to go in and have a rest

317
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,000
Injured

318
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,160
And said no

319
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,199
I saw it all

320
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,119
Take your hands out

321
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,400
Let me check

322
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,599
What are you doing

323
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,400
Hold out your hand

324
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,280
Where else is it hurt

325
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:06,880
Leg

326
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,439
I said I'm fine. Get up

327
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,719
You let me have a look. Come on

328
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,439
Who told you to express your feelings to the queen

329
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,839
Gong Zhengsi's staff responsibility

330
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,199
Is that what you can stand

331
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,640
Do you know that

332
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,239
Do you realize that you almost died yourself

333
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:32,680
That's enough

334
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,199
Don't cry

335
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,439
Look

336
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,119
Am I alive and well now

337
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,439
The Queen won't kill me yet

338
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,839
Who

339
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,239
You come back, come back

340
00:27:59,239 --> 00:27:59,760
Don't cry

341
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,359
I'm not crying

342
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,599
You're not crying yet

343
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,800
As soon as I came back, I heard that you went to Qingning Palace

344
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
Why are you so stupid

345
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,839
To give up the crown prince

346
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,599
You sympathize with others everywhere

347
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,880
Why don't you pity yourself

348
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,680
All right

349
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,920
You cry so ugly

350
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:42,760
Purple Azolla

351
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
They are all poor people, too

352
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,359
We have to fight each other

353
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,680
Isn't it more pathetic

354
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,040
I only let it happen once

355
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,800
Just this once

356
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay

357
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,359
All right, stop crying

358
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,760
His Royal Highness the King of Wei His Royal Highness the King of Wei

359
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,359
It's not ready to start yet

360
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:16,760
Be obedient

361
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,439
Start and open

362
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,479
You can't go to the fields yet

363
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,560
Be obedient and obedient

364
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,520
Your Highness

365
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
It'll be ready in a minute

366
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,319
You can't go to the fields yet

367
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,319
His Royal Highness King Wei

368
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,760
Zhan, what are you doing again

369
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,199
I've been ill for so long

370
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,040
Why didn't my mother come to see me

371
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,239
I want to see my mother

372
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,760
I'm going back soon

373
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,040
Nonsense

374
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:35,719
Go back

375
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,439
Sheng Taiyi worked hard

376
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,040
Your Highness has spoken heavily

377
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
This is the responsibility of Wei Chen

378
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:58,280
Sheng Taiyi's prescription about Wei Wang in these two days

379
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,319
I was just about to ask you for advice

380
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,040
Yes

381
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,439
Xiao Shi

382
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,439
Who allowed you to fool around like this

383
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,920
Brother, is my mother a bad woman

384
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,439
Who said that

385
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,520
Everyone says she is a bad woman

386
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,040
To frame the Queen

387
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,160
Put my life at risk

388
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:21,719
Do you mean it

389
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,319
Now my father is angry

390
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,119
Even he doesn't want me

391
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,199
You won't come to see me, will you

392
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,439
When you're asleep

393
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,319
Father has been here long ago

394
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,640
It's just that he has something important to discuss now

395
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,239
As for your mother concubine

396
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
When you are seriously ill,

397
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,800
She went to the temple to pray for you

398
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,719
That's why I couldn't be with you

399
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,400
Really

400
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,400
When you are well,

401
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,800
Naturally, you will know whether it is true or false

402
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,199
But

403
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,800
If you keep being so disobedient,

404
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,160
I got angry.

405
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,920
That big brother will wait for me to get well

406
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,560
Don't forget what you promised me

407
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I'm going to release the eagle

408
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,800
I also want to go hunting

409
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,800
It's just

410
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:06,800
Rest assured

411
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,800
Big Brother will find the best doctor in the world

412
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,719
Treat you

413
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,920
When you're ready

414
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,719
Big Brother will take you hunting

415
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:26,680
Your Highness, I can't help it either

416
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,800
His Royal Highness the King of Wei refused to eat

417
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
I have to go on asking questions

418
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,680
I this

419
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,040
It can only be like this

420
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,959
Your Highness, I won't dare next time

421
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,920
There is too much gossip in your highness's palace

422
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,920
If someone intends to sow discord,

423
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,239
On the contrary, I will misunderstand you and the empress

424
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,560
It is better to tell the facts in advance

425
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,040
So as not to hurt brotherhood

426
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,560
Guo Guifei has thousands of mistakes

427
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
She is also Ayan's mother

428
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,920
How can you say this to a child

429
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:57,920
Even if you want to say

430
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,800
I will say it myself after recovery

431
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,680
Who allowed you to make your own decisions

432
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,319
Your Highness, the handmaiden knew he was wrong

433
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,640
Handmaiden never dared again

434
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Your Highness, I will never dare again

435
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,239
Handmaiden knows wrong

436
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,319
You can go. You won't be needed in the future

437
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,800
Your Highness, the handmaiden followed you when he was six years old

438
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:18,920
You are my God

439
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,880
Where do you want me to go

440
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,319
After you let me go

441
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,520
How can I stand on a cone

442
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,199
The handmaiden is wrong. The handmaiden is wrong

443
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,479
Handmaiden never dared again

444
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,359
Never again, Your Highness

445
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,119
Yuan Qi is also dedicated to thinking of his master

446
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,959
Will do something wrong

447
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,280
Why don't you spare him for my sake

448
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,319
Yuan Qi

449
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,319
In the future, you should be careful not to do it again

450
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,760
Handmaiden never dared again

451
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,920
If you do it again

452
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,040
He cut off the handmaiden's tongue

453
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,479
Go and get forty sticks

454
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,479
Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you, Your Highness

455
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,239
Get up quickly

456
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,160
Handmaiden will never forget the great kindness of the Crown Princess

457
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:06,599
Come

458
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:17,719
Right

459
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,560
Xiao Shi

460
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,479
From now on

461
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,359
Yao Ziliao was officially promoted to Canon Food

462
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,280
Yin Ziping is in charge of food

463
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,760
You should do your job well in the future

464
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,439
Yes

465
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,800
Han Ying's sister

466
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,120
Let me see Meng Shang again

467
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,040
Don't transfer me to Shanglinyuan

468
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
I don't want to go there

469
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,040
Meng Shangshi, please don't drive me away

470
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,959
Meng Shang Shi Please Meng Shang Shi

471
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,719
Please, Meng Shangshi

472
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,679
Please, please

473
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,719
Do me a favor

474
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,760
Do me a favor

475
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,840
Please help me. Help me

476
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Dare to ask Meng Shangshi

477
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,000
What fault did she make when she heard the canon meal

478
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,040
You're gonna kick her out

479
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,679
Meritorious service should be rewarded and punished

480
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,120
Can define merits and demerits in the future

481
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
I am the only one in the food bureau

482
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,959
Do you all understand

483
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,600
Yes

484
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,800
According to Meng Shang's overbearing temper,

485
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,120
Get rid of Wen Yantao and don't even find a reason

486
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,360
Those who go up to intercede now

487
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,919
There must be no good fruit to eat

488
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,080
That's enough

489
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,959
Wen Yantao is eager for quick success and instant benefit

490
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,520
When Meng Shangshi was in trouble,

491
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,040
She also deliberately made things difficult

492
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,479
She was transferred to Shanglinyuan at this time

493
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,360
Maybe it's a good thing

494
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,280
Now Hu Shangshi has lost the support of the Queen

495
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:25,080
Is to lose the greatest dependence

496
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,879
People who take refuge in her in various departments

497
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,840
Be denounced one by one

498
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,040
You guess

499
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,959
Who will be the next person to be deported

500
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,520
All right

501
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,879
Zihao, I finally became a palm meal

502
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm on the palm. I'm on the palm

503
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,280
I am the palm meal

504
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:19,760
It's all like this

505
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
Don't you find another backer

506
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,000
If it weren't for Monteggia

507
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,800
Master can't be expelled from the palace

508
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,040
I will never take refuge in the enemy

509
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,199
Besides, it's not at the end of its tether

510
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,399
Why should you be so discouraged

511
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,719
You don't want to watch helplessly

512
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,879
Watch the Shang Food Bureau fall back into the hands of Meng

513
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,360
In this case

514
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,800
Please wait patiently for the opportunity

515
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,399
Please invite the imperial concubine to dinner

516
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,639
The Queen is involved in this matter

517
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,479
I don't want to save you

518
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,320
You face me now

519
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,040
There is no resentment at all

520
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,800
Why

521
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,199
Please treat the empress to dinner

522
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,199
Answer me

523
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,439
The imperial concubine did not give real trust

524
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,000
Will be defeated so easily

525
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,159
What's the use of grief at this point

526
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:44,439
Why don't you think about how to recover?

527
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:48,000
Dai Yuan has been sentenced to prison

528
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,560
A real disaster

529
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,879
It's just around the corner

530
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,399
Empress

531
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,639
It's better to fight hard than to wait and die

532
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,439
If the empress is willing to give me real trust

533
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:05,120
I will help you tide over the difficulties

534
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,439
Wei Wang has recovered his health

535
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,639
Just listlessness, poor appetite

536
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,080
His Royal Highness is very worried

537
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,840
Life is still in the food bureau, and everyone shows their strengths

538
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,080
Be sure to let Wei Wang resume eating

539
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,040
Yes

540
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,120
Meng Shangshi's orders just now

541
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,280
Everybody hear me clearly

542
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,120
No matter what method is used,

543
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,520
Be sure to coax King Wei to eat

544
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,959
Well done, the East Palace is rewarded

545
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,719
If you don't do well, you can't escape punishment from top to bottom.

546
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,919
Go quickly

547
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,000
Yes

548
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,959
Jade, can you help me put that

549
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,120
Yao canon meal

550
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,800
What meal are you going to prepare for King Wei

551
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,080
Shall I help you

552
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,719
No need

553
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,719
Since I decided to stay in the still food bureau,

554
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,120
It is inevitable that there will be a contest between you and me

555
00:39:58,959 --> 00:39:59,959
But do you know that

556
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,040
I started entering the kitchen when I was five years old

557
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,080
Practice day and night every day

558
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
Can you argue with me

559
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,120
Want to be a good cook

560
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,000
Let the world see the beauty of Chinese drinking

561
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,000
Do it if you want to

562
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,840
Famous chefs in the Forbidden City

563
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,439
And the chef of the rich and wealthy

564
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,120
Street restaurants

565
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,919
A mother who cooks in a poor family

566
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,080
Don't they all do the same thing

567
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,479
Divided into 369 for no reason

568
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,199
It is also necessary to make judgments

569
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
This kind of state of mind has fallen into the lower multiplication

570
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,040
Why don't you understand

571
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,080
To put it bluntly, it's no better than

572
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,840
Fuck off

573
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,840
Vulgar and unbearable

574
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,199
Why are you so late

575
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:58,959
Wei Wang summoned

576
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,320
This is

577
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:19,840
Handmaiden heard

578
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,000
Chrysanthemum into Pu'er can treat furuncle and swelling

579
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,719
It can also clear fire and improve eyesight

580
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,600
It is of great benefit to the health of His Royal Highness King Wei

581
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,320
That's why I dared to give it a try

582
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,120
His Royal Highness King Wei

583
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,919
To suit your taste

584
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,040
The handmaiden also specially added a little rock sugar

585
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:39,080
It can eliminate the bitterness of chrysanthemums

586
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,360
Take a sip

587
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,719
Try this crystal sweet-scented osmanthus cake

588
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,679
Osmanthus fragrans are picked by handmaidens

589
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,879
I hear that you often feel your heart burning

590
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,199
And sore throat

591
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,879
This can alleviate

592
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,560
Or would you like to try steamed crab dumplings

593
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,040
Your Highness, eat one

594
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:05,520
I don't want to eat

595
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:07,800
Your Highness

596
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:10,760
Let's have a bite of crab dumplings

597
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Look at this crab dumpling

598
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
This skin is so thin

599
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,520
You can see the crab meat inside

600
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,360
Every one is so full

601
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:18,639
Particularly delicious

602
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,919
Come and have a bite

603
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,000
Take a bite

604
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,840
I don't eat I don't eat

605
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,040
I just don't eat

606
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,479
Good, good, don't eat, don't eat

607
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,520
And sugar egg powder

608
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,800
Crisp, crisp, sweet and delicious

609
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Ensure that the entrance is melted

610
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,280
Eat it in your mouth

611
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,320
Can bite very delicate sugar silk

612
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,120
The mouth is full of thick egg fragrance

613
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:45,080
This is a minister

614
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,040
The sweetest and crispest cake you have ever eaten

615
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:49,080
Your Highness

616
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,919
I won't eat it

617
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,679
Your Highness

618
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:52,959
Your Highness, calm down. Your Highness, calm down

619
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,439
Your Highness, calm down

620
00:42:57,479 --> 00:42:59,760
Your Highness, this is called shrimp

621
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,239
Please taste it, Your Highness

622
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,600
Your Highness and this

623
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,959
Look how fun it is

624
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,560
Eat one

625
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,360
Are you juggling

626
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,040
To coax me in such a ridiculous way

627
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:20,000
Take it all away

628
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:21,120
Take it all away

629
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,560
Your Highness

630
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:25,199
Shrimp with unique flavor, handmaiden dares to offer it

631
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:27,360
Handmaiden is guilty. Please forgive your highness

632
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:32,760
Your Highness is not angry

633
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:33,520
Not angry

634
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,360
Your Highness

635
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:45,399
Please taste it, Your Highness

636
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,919
Your Highness, look, this hedgehog is small

637
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:54,399
But it needs to be cut enough for 120 scissors

638
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:55,040
Bold

639
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,199
Your Highness has said everything

640
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:58,000
Are you conjuring your highness
