1
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Your Highness, you can't expect it

2
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,839
The leader of the Han Wangfu hasn't had time to carefully examine it

3
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,440
He mysteriously disappeared in prison

4
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,160
There is another mystery behind this matter

5
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
The crux lies in swimming a sail

6
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,639
Go to the Qing Palace

7
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,160
Your Highness

8
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,639
Your Highness

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,120
From Ganqing Palace

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,759
Your Highness, what does the emperor mean by this move

11
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,600
Your Highness

12
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,000
I still don't understand

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,520
Don't listen and watch Mo Wen

14
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
This is your majesty's will

15
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,440
The motto of serving the book

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,479
Study behind closed doors

17
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,440
Moon flower

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,559
Zi Jin

19
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,039
Why are you out when it's raining

20
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,759
Isn't it that the reward of empress Zhuang Fei is too expensive

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
I'm really ashamed of it

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,399
I made her some cakes and sent them over

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,559
Who knew it was raining so hard

24
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,520
What's the matter

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,119
You see you

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,399
It's all soaked

27
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,239
It's hot

28
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,040
Zi Jin

29
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,799
Zi Jin

30
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,040
Mother

31
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,880
Poor Zi Jin

32
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,720
My mother is gone

33
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,440
Where is your mother

34
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,160
Go and ask

35
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,959
Just go down

36
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,839
It's your highness

37
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,799
Dong an governs Jinyang

38
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,079
Ask for politics in Jian Lao

39
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,920
Jian Lao Yue

40
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:13,839
Loyalty, Faith and Dare

41
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,600
Dong Anyu said

42
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,440
An Zhonghu

43
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,720
This Liu lecturer is famous for his rattling

44
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,279
He talks about it many times on weekdays

45
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Your Highness can endure it

46
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,959
What's going on today

47
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
How do you feel your highness is upset

48
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,160
Knowing to ask

49
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,679
I-I'm going to the food bureau

50
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,359
His Highness, he won't let me go

51
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,920
It's just a palace maid who delivers food

52
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,720
It matters very much whether you come or not

53
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,920
Maybe

54
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
It burns on the stove

55
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,920
The kitchen knife is hurt

56
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,399
It is also possible that when carrying water,

57
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,000
Maybe I accidentally planted it

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,679
You are bad

59
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,760
I can recite this one already

60
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,799
I read it again, and the great sense of honor is clear to my heart

61
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,200
You don't have to read it over and over again

62
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,399
Let's call it a day

63
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,399
You go down first

64
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,760
Yes

65
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,559
Joke joke

66
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,679
In a good mood today

67
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,239
I'm going hunting outside the city

68
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,239
Chen Wu

69
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,399
It all went headlong into the well

70
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,600
Your Highness is still indifferent

71
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,640
You made a mistake this time

72
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,519
Don't you go soon

73
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,640
Your Highness has caught it

74
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,959
Your Highness sent it this morning

75
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,760
Etiquette statement

76
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Luo Zhuer, a left-behind Zhongwei soldier in Nanjing

77
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
His wife Yin Shi gave birth to three men

78
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,679
Please give rice banknotes according to the old rules

79
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,559
Qin Tianjian reported that there were stars as big as lights last night

80
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,520
Cyanine white

81
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
Guizhou provincial judges reported by Hu Qi

82
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,400
There are auspicious animals in mountains and rivers

83
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,799
White matter and black chapter, the first tiger body

84
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
Your Highness hasn't finished reading yet

85
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,200
Give me the rest

86
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
It's all useless verbosity

87
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Send this to Grandpa Huang

88
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,280
Your Highness, is this wrong

89
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,239
The grain is abundant and the weather is good

90
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,000
When the people are rich, they are Shangrui

91
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,239
What does catching an exotic beast have to do with Rui

92
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,400
What to do with the people

93
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,039
Go tell Hu Qi

94
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,960
Lying about auspicious luck all day long

95
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,119
He won't have to do it as a provincial judge

96
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes

97
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,359
Yuan Qi

98
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,440
Your Highness

99
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,719
You go to Shangshi Bureau in person

100
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,520
After seven days, it's getting worse and worse

101
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,919
Yes

102
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,159
The new drug just sent by the pharmacy department

103
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,320
Fry this suit

104
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,000
This

105
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,119
Come

106
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,559
Ginseng tonifies yang of the five internal organs

107
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,159
Fang Dianshan said that she had asked for medicine for a long time

108
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,239
Only willing to give up a few pieces

109
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,159
But I'll watch

110
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,239
This is no ordinary ginseng

111
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,119
Father-in-law Yuan

112
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,960
Everything has been done according to your orders

113
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,679
What if anyone is still talking about it

114
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,400
You can rest assured

115
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,640
I know the importance of this matter

116
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,039
Never make public

117
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,679
But

118
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,320
What's the matter

119
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,320
This

120
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,640
What's the matter

121
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,440
We can't give and receive privately in this palace

122
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,479
Could you please give it to Father Chen

123
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,359
To Chen Wu

124
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,520
To Chen Wu

125
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,799
I give you a fart. I

126
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,080
I'll give you a fart, give it, give it

127
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,840
No vision, no vision, no vision

128
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,719
I'm no better looking than Chen Wu

129
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,479
Banquet peach

130
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,440
Clearly let you deliver meals for Hu Si's meal

131
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,719
How can you pass the buck

132
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Meng Shangshi ordered him to come down

133
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,960
Let me hurry

134
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,719
Take someone to the cellar to get bacon enema

135
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm really overwhelmed

136
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,440
Just let the corn millet send it

137
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,559
Guo Bianfei always sends people over

138
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,400
After a while, I said I wanted milk cakes and milk skins

139
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,679
After a while, he said that he would prepare a crisp cake and send it there

140
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,080
I really can't get away either

141
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,039
Snow reed

142
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,520
Didn't I ask you to deliver it

143
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,919
You see

144
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,080
These sesame oils and sweet sauces

145
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,159
And douchi miscellaneous materials have just been delivered

146
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm counting it

147
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,559
You still eat

148
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,520
Zi Jin

149
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,479
Hu Sishan accidentally sprained his foot yesterday

150
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,880
Can you bring her food

151
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,239
Yes

152
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:50,919
Then I'll go right away

153
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,640
Hu Si Shan

154
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Bring you a meal

155
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
On weekdays, it is a saddle

156
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,400
One by one is too attentive

157
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,159
Now see Meng Shangshi doesn't like me

158
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,320
They are all afraid of touching some edges

159
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,000
Push and push

160
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,640
I pushed you here

161
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,960
Please have your meal

162
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,799
Good self-restraint and patience

163
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,080
Wait a minute

164
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,799
What else do you want from the steward

165
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,320
Would you follow me

166
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,039
Moon flower

167
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,080
This is the famous score I have collected for ten years

168
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,880
Many of them are incomplete

169
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,599
I've been trying to restore it

170
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,200
But one's strength is limited after all

171
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,400
Please help me in the future

172
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,479
Complete the compilation of this ancient spectrum of drinking in past dynasties

173
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,679
Wang Si's meal

174
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,039
This is all your efforts

175
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,200
How can I watch it

176
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,559
Meng Shangshi entrusted you to me

177
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,119
I will teach you with all my heart

178
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,840
There will be no possession

179
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,640
Would you like to

180
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,440
Follow me to learn

181
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,000
Disciple, thank you, master

182
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,159
Is to see me down and out now

183
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,440
Unwilling

184
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,000
Not so

185
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,239
That's unwilling to get involved in factional strife

186
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,800
Just to see you pleasing to the eye

187
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,119
I want to give you a few words

188
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
It's just a good relationship

189
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,839
If you wish

190
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
You can't call me sister too much in the future

191
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,479
But

192
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,800
Why

193
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,239
Yin Ziping is narrow-minded

194
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,319
Su Yuehua thinks highly of himself

195
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,520
Only you

196
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,280
Can treat everyone fairly and justly

197
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,319
Up and down the food bureau

198
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,560
Few people say you are wrong

199
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,880
This skill

200
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
It's not easy

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,079
But Wang Sishan hates me very much

202
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,520
This man

203
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,400
The pursuit is to drink to the best of the environment

204
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,479
What you want is one heart and one mind

205
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,760
She decided you weren't sincere the first time she saw you

206
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,560
She is too naive

207
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,400
In this harem

208
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,800
Where is the place where you can live by cooking

209
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,280
Likable

210
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,359
To live long

211
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,000
Then

212
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,959
Please ask the steward for advice

213
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,199
There are thousands of businesses in this world

214
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,439
Practitioners

215
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,359
Do you know what is the way to win

216
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,160
Difference

217
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,680
Difference

218
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,640
Purple Azolla

219
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:18,959
Trust me

220
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,000
Go ahead

221
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,319
Shang Shi

222
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,079
She has been on her knees for two hours

223
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,079
Meng Shang Shi

224
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,479
I just want to be allowed to enter the kitchen

225
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,319
I will do my best

226
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,239
Why should I give you a chance

227
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,359
I made such a big mistake

228
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,959
Shang Shi hasn't really kicked me out

229
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,839
Handmaiden dares to guess

230
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,199
You are cherishing my talents

231
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,359
You are a rare Bole in the world

232
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
Know and take it

233
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,760
A lowly man like me has no way out

234
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,959
As long as still eating can give me a chance

235
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,839
I will do my best to be loyal

236
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Everyone knows that taking it is taking it

237
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,560
And don't know to take it

238
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,000
It doesn't seem like something you can say

239
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,920
All right

240
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,079
Yin Ziping

241
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,479
I'll give you one last chance

242
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,640
I hope you can give full play to your strengths

243
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,400
Prove to me earlier that I didn't see the wrong person

244
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,040
Lord Xie Shangshi

245
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,640
Lord Xie Shangshi

246
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,479
Tai Sun Fei

247
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,800
Emperor Taisun sent someone to say

248
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,439
There are other government affairs tonight

249
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,800
I won't come to dinner

250
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,040
Empress

251
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
Once upon a time, no matter how busy the emperor was,

252
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,199
Whenever you go, please

253
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
Always spare leisure

254
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
But since that incident

255
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,719
His Royal Highness has not stepped into the East Nuange for more than a month

256
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,719
Do you think he will know all about it

257
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,280
No

258
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,599
It won't

259
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,640
The elder sister has been properly disposed of

260
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,959
The Department of Pharmacy is even more unnoticed

261
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
Your Highness is just too busy

262
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,599
He is too busy

263
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,640
When he finishes his government affairs,

264
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
Nature will come to see us

265
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No nonsense

266
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,359
Empress

267
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,719
Your Highness is tolerant and considerate to you

268
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,359
It's hard to find in the world

269
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,800
You shouldn't

270
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,520
Empress

271
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,599
The food is already cold

272
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,160
Are you willing to accompany me for life

273
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,280
I

274
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,359
Your Highness

275
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,239
Congratulations to Your Highness

276
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,160
How dare you

277
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,640
Who allowed you to stay here

278
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,719
Who allowed you to read my books again

279
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,199
Put the book away

280
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,400
Your Highness

281
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,719
Handmaiden is reckless for a moment

282
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,359
Your Highness, please forgive me

283
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,239
It was Yuan Gonggong who let the handmaiden leave before the time

284
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,319
I didn't expect your highness to come back early

285
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,599
It was the handmaiden who collided with your highness

286
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,680
Please punish your highness at will

287
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:51,920
Then

288
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,640
How shall I punish you

289
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,160
Since you can read

290
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,280
Then stay with me

291
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Help me organize my books

292
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:04,199
Your Highness

293
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,280
Your Highness

294
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
Handmaiden is the palace maiden of Shangshi Bureau

295
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,839
This is against etiquette

296
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,359
The meat stuffing is wrong

297
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,560
You didn't do it

298
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,680
Back to your highness's words

299
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,839
Wonton was handed down in Ganqing Palace tonight

300
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,760
The Food Bureau has prepared two copies

301
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,680
They are all made of square meals

302
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,400
Dare to ask your highness

303
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,079
What's wrong with it

304
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,000
In the past, pig buttocks were used

305
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,239
And the hind legs of sheep

306
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,719
I also added water chestnuts

307
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,400
Only in this way can you eat tenacity

308
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,880
Why don't you remind her

309
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
How can your highness know

310
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,800
Do you know how bad the food is on weekdays

311
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,079
I put up with it year after year

312
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,920
Never say it

313
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,719
It is because the appetite is not what a gentleman wants

314
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,719
And you know it without reminding her

315
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:07,920
Why

316
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,119
His Royal Highness

317
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:13,680
Today's fresh meat is very tender and fresh

318
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,800
Lying

319
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Because you are now a new kitchen

320
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,439
Dare not openly provoke the authority of canon food

321
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,400
But as a kitchen

322
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,119
It should be based on the needs of diners

323
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,880
Put it in the first place

324
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,400
Are you so perfunctory

325
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,719
As of today

326
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,719
You

327
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,880
Be responsible for my daily meal

328
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,560
If there is slack

329
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:36,959
Be severely punished

330
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes

331
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,719
Take this away

332
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,959
I dare to ask your highness what else you have to give me

333
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,040
You did this

334
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,680
Afraid of me

335
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,439
I

336
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:27,880
Stand down

337
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,640
Yes

338
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:56,839
Miss Yao

339
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,199
Miss Yao

340
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,239
Miss Yao

341
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:02,920
What's the matter

342
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,719
It's getting late at night

343
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,719
Anterior route unknown

344
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,439
Our family will send you back

345
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:07,800
Please

346
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,719
Be rude

347
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,319
Guess who I am

348
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,160
It is the most hated Pingping in the world

349
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,319
It is the cutest Pingping in the world

350
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,319
Let me see

351
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Where is it cute

352
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,160
Lovely everywhere

353
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,880
Meng Shangshi asked me to think about my strengths

354
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,040
But I've been thinking about it all day

355
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
I don't even know

356
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
What are my own strengths

357
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,520
You

358
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,959
Born in the market

359
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,239
Familiar with folk food

360
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:52,160
This is the most precious treasure in the world

361
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,800
So-called

362
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,520
Miscellaneous

363
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,520
This is your strong point

364
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,839
Su Yuehua was born as a famous cook

365
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,760
Good at cooking the world's ingredients

366
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,239
Proficient in major cuisines

367
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,199
Her strength lies in Bo

368
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,439
That's why

369
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,760
Wang Sishan ordered her to perfect the lost ancient music

370
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
Bring forth new ideas in ancient music

371
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,400
This matter must be Yuehua

372
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,560
So you can see it all in your eyes

373
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,040
Authorities are fascinated

374
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,079
Hu Si's food makes me ask for difference

375
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,160
But where is my difference

376
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:38,760
It's not

377
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:42,359
When you cooked meat with medicine,

378
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,920
Even Your Majesty praises you

379
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,199
It's all the blame for Wang Si's meal

380
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,079
Scold you for no reason

381
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,599
Make you tie your hands and feet all day

382
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,640
What difference are you asking for

383
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,079
Cook meat with medicine

384
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,400
I see

385
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,280
Moon flower

386
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,920
Master

387
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,719
What are you doing now

388
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm making gold and silver tofu soup

389
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,839
According to previous generation records

390
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,439
Fried tofu is golden in color

391
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,000
Fresh tofu is as white as silver

392
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,719
This is the name of gold and silver tofu soup

393
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,119
This time

394
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,239
I want to make it with egg white and yolk

395
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,359
What can I learn from reading ancient books recently

396
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,000
I used to think that snowflake crab bucket originated from hibiscus crab

397
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,560
Originally, the court of Song Dynasty began to cook slugs

398
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,920
In Yuan Dynasty, there were honey-brewed slugs

399
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,719
Maybe this is the source of snowflake crab fighting

400
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,800
Chinese diet has a long history

401
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,319
Extensive and profound

402
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,959
Spring and Autumn Period and Warring States Period

403
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,439
Shandong cuisine is fresh, salty and pure

404
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Famous chefs come forth in large numbers

405
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,599
Shu cuisine originated from Chuanfu

406
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,000
One dish, one cube

407
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,160
Hundred dishes and flavors

408
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,280
Unique

409
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,599
Cantonese cuisine in the early Han Dynasty used a wide range of materials

410
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,119
Taste is delicious and pure

411
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,359
Gradually rise to fame

412
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,599
Fujian cuisine is good at cooking mountains and treasures

413
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,000
Walk alone in the world with soup

414
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,160
After Tang and Song Dynasties

415
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,359
Jiangsu and Zhejiang show simultaneously

416
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,079
Exquisite and elegant

417
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,280
Hold up half of the southern food

418
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Hunan vegetable oil is heavy in color, rich, smooth and fat

419
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,280
Anhui cuisine is based on

420
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,880
Tunxi pickled mandarin fish

421
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,199
Horseshoe turtle in sandy land

422
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,919
And is famous all over the world

423
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,320
Therefore, the world says

424
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,840
South sweet, north salty, east spicy and western acid

425
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,000
That's the truth

426
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,239
Good folk cooks are good at one school

427
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,479
What's more

428
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,439
Only one dish in one's life

429
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,040
Now it's up to you to sort out the names of the past dynasties

430
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,439
You should learn to learn from the past and the present

431
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,879
Mastery through a comprehensive study

432
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,760
Yes

433
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,760
Grass millet

434
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,199
Guo Bianfei sent someone to say

435
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
I took the donkey-hide glue paste you sent

436
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,560
Always have a dry throat

437
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,479
Abdominal distension and discomfort

438
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,120
Do you use aged donkey-hide gelatin

439
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,399
The anger of new Ejiao is too high

440
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,199
Only aged donkey-hide gelatin that can be annealed

441
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,320
To supply the master

442
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,439
How can I connect

443
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,080
I can't tell the difference between new and old donkey-hide gelatin

444
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,399
Hu Si Shan

445
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,040
You come with me

446
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,360
Chicken wine soup

447
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,120
Yes

448
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,479
Empress Zhuang Fei has cold hands and feet

449
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,879
I want to make soup with ginger chicken

450
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,439
Taste mellow nourishing

451
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,520
It also has the effect of dispelling cold

452
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,080
Jiangmi wine can stimulate appetite, promote fluid production, promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis

453
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Especially suitable for parturients

454
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,520
But if you treat this cold hand and foot,

455
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,199
Sorghum liquor is more suitable

456
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,080
For example, Guo Bianfei

457
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,639
Deficiency is not affected by tonifying spleen deficiency and qi stagnation

458
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,959
It is better to clear and supplement first

459
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,919
Even aged donkey-hide gelatin can't be used easily

460
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,600
She refused to listen to advice

461
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,560
Will go wrong

462
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,399
Meng Shangshi actually cooked it himself

463
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,040
Yeah

464
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:34,239
I don't know what to do

465
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,199
It's so thin

466
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,040
What is Meng Shangshi going to do

467
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,080
I have no idea

468
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,679
It smells good

469
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,679
No matter how good it tastes

470
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,840
Poor appearance

471
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,080
Just the cooks

472
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,120
Can't be a kitchen

473
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Have you all remembered it

474
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Yes

475
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:25,479
Sumatra Zhancheng, Siam

476
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:28,159
Envoys from Java and other countries will arrive in the capital in a few days

477
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,479
Stay in the hall

478
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
Your Majesty graciously gives a banquet

479
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,800
Guanglu Temple will organize a banquet for 3,000 people

480
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,199
As for Shangshi Bureau,

481
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Guanglu Temple has a life

482
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,320
Prepare daily meal lists for visiting envoys

483
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,399
That's great

484
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:56,800
Two four six eighty

485
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,040
Twelve fourteen

486
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,679
Two four six eight

487
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,239
Wrong number

488
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,879
Lord Zhao, let me have a word

489
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,239
Lord Zhao

490
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:32,239
Livestock sent by the delicacies department this month

491
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,080
Fruits and vegetables

492
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,120
It is 30% less than last month

493
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,679
Quantity of drinks delivered by the Good Brewing Department

494
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,719
It is also seriously inconsistent

495
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,239
Even charcoal firewood

496
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,360
The food utensils can't be compared at all

497
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,479
Wang Si's meal

498
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,600
Everything sent has a rule

499
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,040
It has always been exactly the same

500
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
I'm afraid Wang Sishan's eyes are full of flowers

501
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
If you don't believe me

502
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,040
You can check it on the spot

503
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
You have to check

504
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,120
Then let Meng Shangshi come in person

505
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,159
I don't have the free time

506
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,239
Wang Si's meal

507
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:17,679
Meng Shang Shi

508
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,919
Meng Shangshi, you are just in time

509
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,360
You give a comment on this principle

510
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,280
Undocumented and undocumented

511
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
Insist that there is a difference in the number

512
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,120
There is no such truth in the world

513
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,000
Zhao Sicheng worked hard

514
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,600
I took today's ingredients

515
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,439
Go

516
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:44,840
Meng Shang Shi

517
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,959
Come forward and choose the ingredients

518
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,639
Walk fast

519
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,360
Go

520
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,040
Take this

521
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,360
Meng Shang Shi

522
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,199
They buy ingredients from the folk

523
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,000
I don't know how many people are greedy for ink

524
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,439
Now even go to Linyuan

525
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,800
Dare to deduct the supply of the inner government

526
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,520
Do you really want to sit back and watch

527
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,959
You know clearly

528
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
There are only 3,000 kitchens in Guanglu Temple

529
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,360
But there are more than 9,400 people on the list

530
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,719
They even hooked up with the food supervisor

531
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,120
False report of the monthly confession of the internal supervisor

532
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,320
It is even more one to ten

533
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,280
All right

534
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Guang Luqing Jing Quan and Shang Shanjian's Ten Thousand Palm Seals

535
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,760
Internal and external collusion embezzles internal property

536
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,520
And ten thousand handprints

537
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,879
It is the adopted son of Huang Yan, the eunuch in charge of Sili prison

538
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,840
You have to sue the monk food supervisor of Guanglu Temple

539
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:35,719
You can sue

540
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,520
Your Majesty's favorite eunuch

541
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,120
And

542
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,159
The inner official supervisor goes up and down

543
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,560
They are all his disciples and grandchildren

544
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,199
You can clean up all the eunuchs who closed the palace

545
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,399
Loosen

546
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,840
Meng Shang Shi

547
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,399
This is the food you are interested in

548
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,239
Meng Shang Shi

549
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,120
Pine mushroom is the king of fungi

550
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
It takes years to grow up

551
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,479
The taste is fragrant and fragrant

552
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,959
Such ingredients

553
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,439
Why is it not precious

554
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,199
Land of China

555
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,080
Top ingredients abound

556
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,760
The so-called hump bear's paw

557
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,280
Tricholoma matsutake bird's nest abalone ginseng fin

558
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,760
It's not worth mentioning at all

559
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,120
As a kitchen of Shangshi Bureau,

560
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,879
Discover unusual treasures

561
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,399
Just showed your own skills

562
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,239
Use all these things

563
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,120
Why should I make you

564
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,199
What the hell does this mean

565
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,800
I don't understand

566
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,800
Zi Jin

567
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,080
This

568
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,360
Ugly

569
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:35,800
With pimples in one's heart

570
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,760
What is this

571
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Spinning is so hard

572
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:52,239
Why should mother do it herself

573
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,479
I'm used to it

574
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,719
I don't think it's bitter

575
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,639
Give it to me

576
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,199
Mother is unwell

577
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:25,560
Daughter-in-law should accompany and serve decoction day and night

578
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,360
But I didn't know it

579
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:28,639
Really disrespectful

580
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:30,679
I also asked my mother to forgive me

581
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,679
Brocade book

582
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,080
Please tell the empress

583
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,959
Order someone to invite the emperor and grandson

584
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:09,719
No

585
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:10,760
You go in person

586
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
You finally figured it out

587
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
The Crown Princess wants you to take medicine to recuperate your body

588
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,639
I am also looking forward to your early birth of children

589
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,280
When the temple comes down later

590
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:20,919
You can't stay cold any longer

591
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,479
Go ahead
