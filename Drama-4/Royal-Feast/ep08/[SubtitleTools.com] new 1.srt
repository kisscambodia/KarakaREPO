1
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,319
Shang Shi

2
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,079
She has been on her knees for two hours

3
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,079
Meng Shang Shi

4
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,479
I just want to be allowed to enter the kitchen

5
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,319
I will do my best

6
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,239
Why should I give you a chance

7
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,359
I made such a big mistake

8
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,959
Shang Shi hasn't really kicked me out

9
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,839
Handmaiden dares to guess

10
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,199
You are cherishing my talents

11
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,359
You are a rare Bole in the world

12
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
Know and take it

13
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,760
A lowly man like me has no way out

14
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,959
As long as still eating can give me a chance

15
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,839
I will do my best to be loyal

16
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Everyone knows that taking it is taking it

17
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,560
And don't know to take it

18
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,000
It doesn't seem like something you can say

19
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,920
All right

20
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,079
Yin Ziping

21
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,479
I'll give you one last chance

22
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,640
I hope you can give full play to your strengths

23
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,400
Prove to me earlier that I didn't see the wrong person

24
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,040
Lord Xie Shangshi

25
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,640
Lord Xie Shangshi

26
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,479
Tai Sun Fei

27
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,800
Emperor Taisun sent someone to say

28
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,439
There are other government affairs tonight

29
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,800
I won't come to dinner

30
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,040
Empress

31
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
Once upon a time, no matter how busy the emperor was,

32
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,199
Whenever you go, please

33
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
Always spare leisure

34
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
But since that incident

35
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,719
His Royal Highness has not stepped into the East Nuange for more than a month

36
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,719
Do you think he will know all about it

37
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,280
No

38
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,599
It won't

39
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,640
The elder sister has been properly disposed of

40
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,959
The Department of Pharmacy is even more unnoticed

41
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
Your Highness is just too busy

42
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,599
He is too busy

43
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,640
When he finishes his government affairs,

44
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
Nature will come to see us

45
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No nonsense

46
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,359
Empress

47
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,719
Your Highness is tolerant and considerate to you

48
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,359
It's hard to find in the world

49
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,800
You shouldn't

50
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,520
Empress

51
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,599
The food is already cold

52
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,160
Are you willing to accompany me for life

53
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,280
I

54
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,359
Your Highness

55
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,239
Congratulations to Your Highness

56
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,160
How dare you

57
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,640
Who allowed you to stay here

58
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,719
Who allowed you to read my books again

59
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,199
Put the book away

60
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,400
Your Highness

61
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,719
Handmaiden is reckless for a moment

62
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,359
Your Highness, please forgive me

63
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,239
It was Yuan Gonggong who let the handmaiden leave before the time

64
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,319
I didn't expect your highness to come back early

65
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,599
It was the handmaiden who collided with your highness

66
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,680
Please punish your highness at will

67
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:51,920
Then

68
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,640
How shall I punish you

69
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,160
Since you can read

70
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,280
Then stay with me

71
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Help me organize my books

72
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:04,199
Your Highness

73
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,280
Your Highness

74
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
Handmaiden is the palace maiden of Shangshi Bureau

75
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,839
This is against etiquette

76
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,359
The meat stuffing is wrong

77
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,560
You didn't do it

78
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,680
Back to your highness's words

79
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,839
Wonton was handed down in Ganqing Palace tonight

80
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,760
The Food Bureau has prepared two copies

81
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,680
They are all made of square meals

82
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,400
Dare to ask your highness

83
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,079
What's wrong with it

84
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,000
In the past, pig buttocks were used

85
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,239
And the hind legs of sheep

86
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,719
I also added water chestnuts

87
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,400
Only in this way can you eat tenacity

88
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,880
Why don't you remind her

89
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
How can your highness know

90
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,800
Do you know how bad the food is on weekdays

91
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,079
I put up with it year after year

92
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,920
Never say it

93
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,719
It is because the appetite is not what a gentleman wants

94
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,719
And you know it without reminding her

95
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:07,920
Why

96
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,119
His Royal Highness

97
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:13,680
Today's fresh meat is very tender and fresh

98
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,800
Lying

99
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Because you are now a new kitchen

100
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,439
Dare not openly provoke the authority of canon food

101
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,400
But as a kitchen

102
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,119
It should be based on the needs of diners

103
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,880
Put it in the first place

104
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,400
Are you so perfunctory

105
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,719
As of today

106
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,719
You

107
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,880
Be responsible for my daily meal

108
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,560
If there is slack

109
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:36,959
Be severely punished

110
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes

111
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,719
Take this away

112
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,959
I dare to ask your highness what else you have to give me

113
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,040
You did this

114
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,680
Afraid of me

115
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,439
I

116
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:27,880
Stand down

117
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,640
Yes

118
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:56,839
Miss Yao

119
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,199
Miss Yao

120
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,239
Miss Yao

121
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:02,920
What's the matter

122
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,719
It's getting late at night

123
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,719
Anterior route unknown

124
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,439
Our family will send you back

125
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:07,800
Please

126
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,719
Be rude

127
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,319
Guess who I am

128
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,160
It is the most hated Pingping in the world

129
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,319
It is the cutest Pingping in the world

130
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,319
Let me see

131
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Where is it cute

132
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,160
Lovely everywhere

133
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,880
Meng Shangshi asked me to think about my strengths

134
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,040
But I've been thinking about it all day

135
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
I don't even know

136
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
What are my own strengths

137
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,520
You

138
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,959
Born in the market

139
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,239
Familiar with folk food

140
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:52,160
This is the most precious treasure in the world

141
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,800
So-called

142
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,520
Miscellaneous

143
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,520
This is your strong point

144
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,839
Su Yuehua was born as a famous cook

145
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,760
Good at cooking the world's ingredients

146
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,239
Proficient in major cuisines

147
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,199
Her strength lies in Bo

148
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,439
That's why

149
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,760
Wang Sishan ordered her to perfect the lost ancient music

150
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
Bring forth new ideas in ancient music

151
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,400
This matter must be Yuehua

152
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,560
So you can see it all in your eyes

153
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,040
Authorities are fascinated

154
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,079
Hu Si's food makes me ask for difference

155
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,160
But where is my difference

156
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:38,760
It's not

157
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:42,359
When you cooked meat with medicine,

158
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,920
Even Your Majesty praises you

159
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,199
It's all the blame for Wang Si's meal

160
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,079
Scold you for no reason

161
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,599
Make you tie your hands and feet all day

162
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,640
What difference are you asking for

163
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,079
Cook meat with medicine

164
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,400
I see

165
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,280
Moon flower

166
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,920
Master

167
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,719
What are you doing now

168
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm making gold and silver tofu soup

169
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,839
According to previous generation records

170
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,439
Fried tofu is golden in color

171
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,000
Fresh tofu is as white as silver

172
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,719
This is the name of gold and silver tofu soup

173
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,119
This time

174
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,239
I want to make it with egg white and yolk

175
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,359
What can I learn from reading ancient books recently

176
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,000
I used to think that snowflake crab bucket originated from hibiscus crab

177
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,560
Originally, the court of Song Dynasty began to cook slugs

178
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,920
In Yuan Dynasty, there were honey-brewed slugs

179
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,719
Maybe this is the source of snowflake crab fighting

180
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,800
Chinese diet has a long history

181
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,319
Extensive and profound

182
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,959
Spring and Autumn Period and Warring States Period

183
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,439
Shandong cuisine is fresh, salty and pure

184
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Famous chefs come forth in large numbers

185
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,599
Shu cuisine originated from Chuanfu

186
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,000
One dish, one cube

187
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,160
Hundred dishes and flavors

188
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,280
Unique

189
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,599
Cantonese cuisine in the early Han Dynasty used a wide range of materials

190
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,119
Taste is delicious and pure

191
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,359
Gradually rise to fame

192
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,599
Fujian cuisine is good at cooking mountains and treasures

193
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,000
Walk alone in the world with soup

194
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,160
After Tang and Song Dynasties

195
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,359
Jiangsu and Zhejiang show simultaneously

196
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,079
Exquisite and elegant

197
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,280
Hold up half of the southern food

198
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Hunan vegetable oil is heavy in color, rich, smooth and fat

199
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,280
Anhui cuisine is based on

200
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,880
Tunxi pickled mandarin fish

201
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,199
Horseshoe turtle in sandy land

202
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,919
And is famous all over the world

203
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,320
Therefore, the world says

204
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,840
South sweet, north salty, east spicy and western acid

205
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,000
That's the truth

206
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,239
Good folk cooks are good at one school

207
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,479
What's more

208
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,439
Only one dish in one's life

209
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,040
Now it's up to you to sort out the names of the past dynasties

210
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,439
You should learn to learn from the past and the present

211
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,879
Mastery through a comprehensive study

212
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,760
Yes

213
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,760
Grass millet

214
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,199
Guo Bianfei sent someone to say

215
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
I took the donkey-hide glue paste you sent

216
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,560
Always have a dry throat

217
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,479
Abdominal distension and discomfort

218
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,120
Do you use aged donkey-hide gelatin

219
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,399
The anger of new Ejiao is too high

220
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,199
Only aged donkey-hide gelatin that can be annealed

221
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,320
To supply the master

222
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,439
How can I connect

223
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,080
I can't tell the difference between new and old donkey-hide gelatin

224
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,399
Hu Si Shan

225
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,040
You come with me

226
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,360
Chicken wine soup

227
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,120
Yes

228
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,479
Empress Zhuang Fei has cold hands and feet

229
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,879
I want to make soup with ginger chicken

230
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,439
Taste mellow nourishing

231
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,520
It also has the effect of dispelling cold

232
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,080
Jiangmi wine can stimulate appetite, promote fluid production, promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis

233
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Especially suitable for parturients

234
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,520
But if you treat this cold hand and foot,

235
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,199
Sorghum liquor is more suitable

236
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,080
For example, Guo Bianfei

237
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,639
Deficiency is not affected by tonifying spleen deficiency and qi stagnation

238
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,959
It is better to clear and supplement first

239
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,919
Even aged donkey-hide gelatin can't be used easily

240
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,600
She refused to listen to advice

241
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,560
Will go wrong

242
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,399
Meng Shangshi actually cooked it himself

243
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,040
Yeah

244
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:34,239
I don't know what to do

245
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,199
It's so thin

246
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,040
What is Meng Shangshi going to do

247
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,080
I have no idea

248
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,679
It smells good

249
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,679
No matter how good it tastes

250
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,840
Poor appearance

251
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,080
Just the cooks

252
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,120
Can't be a kitchen

253
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Have you all remembered it

254
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Yes

255
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:25,479
Sumatra Zhancheng, Siam

256
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:28,159
Envoys from Java and other countries will arrive in the capital in a few days

257
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,479
Stay in the hall

258
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
Your Majesty graciously gives a banquet

259
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,800
Guanglu Temple will organize a banquet for 3,000 people

260
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,199
As for Shangshi Bureau,

261
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Guanglu Temple has a life

262
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,320
Prepare daily meal lists for visiting envoys

263
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,399
That's great

264
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:56,800
Two four six eighty

265
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,040
Twelve fourteen

266
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,679
Two four six eight

267
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,239
Wrong number

268
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,879
Lord Zhao, let me have a word

269
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,239
Lord Zhao

270
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:32,239
Livestock sent by the delicacies department this month

271
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,080
Fruits and vegetables

272
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,120
It is 30% less than last month

273
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,679
Quantity of drinks delivered by the Good Brewing Department

274
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,719
It is also seriously inconsistent

275
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,239
Even charcoal firewood

276
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,360
The food utensils can't be compared at all

277
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,479
Wang Si's meal

278
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,600
Everything sent has a rule

279
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,040
It has always been exactly the same

280
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
I'm afraid Wang Sishan's eyes are full of flowers

281
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
If you don't believe me

282
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,040
You can check it on the spot

283
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
You have to check

284
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,120
Then let Meng Shangshi come in person

285
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,159
I don't have the free time

286
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,239
Wang Si's meal

287
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:17,679
Meng Shang Shi

288
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,919
Meng Shangshi, you are just in time

289
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,360
You give a comment on this principle

290
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,280
Undocumented and undocumented

291
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
Insist that there is a difference in the number

292
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,120
There is no such truth in the world

293
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,000
Zhao Sicheng worked hard

294
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,600
I took today's ingredients

295
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,439
Go

296
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:44,840
Meng Shang Shi

297
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,959
Come forward and choose the ingredients

298
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,639
Walk fast

299
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,360
Go

300
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,040
Take this

301
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,360
Meng Shang Shi

302
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,199
They buy ingredients from the folk

303
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,000
I don't know how many people are greedy for ink

304
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,439
Now even go to Linyuan

305
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,800
Dare to deduct the supply of the inner government

306
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,520
Do you really want to sit back and watch

307
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,959
You know clearly

308
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
There are only 3,000 kitchens in Guanglu Temple

309
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,360
But there are more than 9,400 people on the list

310
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,719
They even hooked up with the food supervisor

311
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,120
False report of the monthly confession of the internal supervisor

312
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,320
It is even more one to ten

313
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,280
All right

314
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Guang Luqing Jing Quan and Shang Shanjian's Ten Thousand Palm Seals

315
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,760
Internal and external collusion embezzles internal property

316
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,520
And ten thousand handprints

317
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,879
It is the adopted son of Huang Yan, the eunuch in charge of Sili prison

318
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,840
You have to sue the monk food supervisor of Guanglu Temple

319
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:35,719
You can sue

320
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,520
Your Majesty's favorite eunuch

321
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,120
And

322
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,159
The inner official supervisor goes up and down

323
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,560
They are all his disciples and grandchildren

324
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,199
You can clean up all the eunuchs who closed the palace

325
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,399
Loosen

326
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,840
Meng Shang Shi

327
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,399
This is the food you are interested in

328
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,239
Meng Shang Shi

329
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,120
Pine mushroom is the king of fungi

330
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
It takes years to grow up

331
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,479
The taste is fragrant and fragrant

332
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,959
Such ingredients

333
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,439
Why is it not precious

334
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,199
Land of China

335
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,080
Top ingredients abound

336
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,760
The so-called hump bear's paw

337
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,280
Tricholoma matsutake bird's nest abalone ginseng fin

338
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,760
It's not worth mentioning at all

339
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,120
As a kitchen of Shangshi Bureau,

340
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,879
Discover unusual treasures

341
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,399
Just showed your own skills

342
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,239
Use all these things

343
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,120
Why should I make you

344
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,199
What the hell does this mean

345
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,800
I don't understand

346
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,800
Zi Jin

347
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,080
This

348
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,360
Ugly

349
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:35,800
With pimples in one's heart

350
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,760
What is this

351
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Spinning is so hard

352
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:52,239
Why should mother do it herself

353
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,479
I'm used to it

354
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,719
I don't think it's bitter

355
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,639
Give it to me

356
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,199
Mother is unwell

357
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:25,560
Daughter-in-law should accompany and serve decoction day and night

358
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,360
But I didn't know it

359
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:28,639
Really disrespectful

360
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:30,679
I also asked my mother to forgive me

361
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,679
Brocade book

362
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,080
Please tell the empress

363
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,959
Order someone to invite the emperor and grandson

364
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:09,719
No

365
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:10,760
You go in person

366
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
You finally figured it out

367
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
The Crown Princess wants you to take medicine to recuperate your body

368
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,639
I am also looking forward to your early birth of children

369
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,280
When the temple comes down later

370
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:20,919
You can't stay cold any longer

371
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,479
Go ahead
