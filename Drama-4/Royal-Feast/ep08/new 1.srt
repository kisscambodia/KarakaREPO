221
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,319
Shang Shi

222
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,079
She has been on her knees for two hours

223
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,079
Meng Shang Shi

224
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,479
I just want to be allowed to enter the kitchen

225
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,319
I will do my best

226
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:11,239
Why should I give you a chance

227
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,359
I made such a big mistake

228
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,959
Shang Shi hasn't really kicked me out

229
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,839
Handmaiden dares to guess

230
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,199
You are cherishing my talents

231
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,359
You are a rare Bole in the world

232
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,160
Know and take it

233
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,760
A lowly man like me has no way out

234
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,959
As long as still eating can give me a chance

235
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,839
I will do my best to be loyal

236
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Everyone knows that taking it is taking it

237
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,560
And don't know to take it

238
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,000
It doesn't seem like something you can say

239
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,920
All right

240
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,079
Yin Ziping

241
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,479
I'll give you one last chance

242
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,640
I hope you can give full play to your strengths

243
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,400
Prove to me earlier that I didn't see the wrong person

244
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,040
Lord Xie Shangshi

245
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,640
Lord Xie Shangshi

246
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,479
Tai Sun Fei

247
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,800
Emperor Taisun sent someone to say

248
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,439
There are other government affairs tonight

249
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,800
I won't come to dinner

250
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,040
Empress

251
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,680
Once upon a time, no matter how busy the emperor was,

252
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,199
Whenever you go, please

253
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,560
Always spare leisure

254
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,560
But since that incident

255
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,719
His Royal Highness has not stepped into the East Nuange for more than a month

256
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,719
Do you think he will know all about it

257
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,280
No

258
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,599
It won't

259
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,640
The elder sister has been properly disposed of

260
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,959
The Department of Pharmacy is even more unnoticed

261
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,280
Your Highness is just too busy

262
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,599
He is too busy

263
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,640
When he finishes his government affairs,

264
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,160
Nature will come to see us

265
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
No nonsense

266
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,359
Empress

267
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,719
Your Highness is tolerant and considerate to you

268
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,359
It's hard to find in the world

269
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,800
You shouldn't

270
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,520
Empress

271
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,599
The food is already cold

272
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,160
Are you willing to accompany me for life

273
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,280
I

274
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,359
Your Highness

275
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,239
Congratulations to Your Highness

276
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,160
How dare you

277
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,640
Who allowed you to stay here

278
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,719
Who allowed you to read my books again

279
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,199
Put the book away

280
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,400
Your Highness

281
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,719
Handmaiden is reckless for a moment

282
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,359
Your Highness, please forgive me

283
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,239
It was Yuan Gonggong who let the handmaiden leave before the time

284
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,319
I didn't expect your highness to come back early

285
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,599
It was the handmaiden who collided with your highness

286
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,680
Please punish your highness at will

287
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:56,920
Then

288
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,640
How shall I punish you

289
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,160
Since you can read

290
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,280
Then stay with me

291
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Help me organize my books

292
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,199
Your Highness

293
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,280
Your Highness

294
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,400
Handmaiden is the palace maiden of Shangshi Bureau

295
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,839
This is against etiquette

296
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,359
The meat stuffing is wrong

297
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,560
You didn't do it

298
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,680
Back to your highness's words

299
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,839
Wonton was handed down in Ganqing Palace tonight

300
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,760
The Food Bureau has prepared two copies

301
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:45,680
They are all made of square meals

302
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,400
Dare to ask your highness

303
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,079
What's wrong with it

304
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,000
In the past, pig buttocks were used

305
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,239
And the hind legs of sheep

306
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,719
I also added water chestnuts

307
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,400
Only in this way can you eat tenacity

308
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,880
Why don't you remind her

309
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
How can your highness know

310
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,800
Do you know how bad the food is on weekdays

311
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,079
I put up with it year after year

312
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:04,920
Never say it

313
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,719
It is because the appetite is not what a gentleman wants

314
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,719
And you know it without reminding her

315
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:12,920
Why

316
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,119
His Royal Highness

317
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:18,680
Today's fresh meat is very tender and fresh

318
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,800
Lying

319
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Because you are now a new kitchen

320
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,439
Dare not openly provoke the authority of canon food

321
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,400
But as a kitchen

322
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,119
It should be based on the needs of diners

323
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:29,880
Put it in the first place

324
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:32,400
Are you so perfunctory

325
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:35,719
As of today

326
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:36,719
You

327
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,880
Be responsible for my daily meal

328
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:40,560
If there is slack

329
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:41,959
Be severely punished

330
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:43,920
Yes

331
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,719
Take this away

332
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,959
I dare to ask your highness what else you have to give me

333
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,040
You did this

334
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,680
Afraid of me

335
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,439
I

336
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:32,880
Stand down

337
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:36,640
Yes

338
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:01,839
Miss Yao

339
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,199
Miss Yao

340
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,239
Miss Yao

341
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:07,920
What's the matter

342
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,719
It's getting late at night

343
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,719
Anterior route unknown

344
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,439
Our family will send you back

345
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:12,800
Please

346
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:14,719
Be rude

347
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,319
Guess who I am

348
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,160
It is the most hated Pingping in the world

349
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,319
It is the cutest Pingping in the world

350
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,319
Let me see

351
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Where is it cute

352
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,160
Lovely everywhere

353
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,880
Meng Shangshi asked me to think about my strengths

354
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,040
But I've been thinking about it all day

355
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,520
I don't even know

356
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
What are my own strengths

357
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:46,520
You

358
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,959
Born in the market

359
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,239
Familiar with folk food

360
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,160
This is the most precious treasure in the world

361
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,800
So-called

362
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,520
Miscellaneous

363
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,520
This is your strong point

364
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,839
Su Yuehua was born as a famous cook

365
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:10,760
Good at cooking the world's ingredients

366
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,239
Proficient in major cuisines

367
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,199
Her strength lies in Bo

368
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,439
That's why

369
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,760
Wang Sishan ordered her to perfect the lost ancient music

370
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,640
Bring forth new ideas in ancient music

371
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,400
This matter must be Yuehua

372
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,560
So you can see it all in your eyes

373
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,040
Authorities are fascinated

374
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,079
Hu Si's food makes me ask for difference

375
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,160
But where is my difference

376
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:43,760
It's not

377
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,359
When you cooked meat with medicine,

378
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,920
Even Your Majesty praises you

379
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,199
It's all the blame for Wang Si's meal

380
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,079
Scold you for no reason

381
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,599
Make you tie your hands and feet all day

382
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,640
What difference are you asking for

383
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,079
Cook meat with medicine

384
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,400
I see

385
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,280
Moon flower

386
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,920
Master

387
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,719
What are you doing now

388
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm making gold and silver tofu soup

389
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,839
According to previous generation records

390
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,439
Fried tofu is golden in color

391
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,000
Fresh tofu is as white as silver

392
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,719
This is the name of gold and silver tofu soup

393
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,119
This time

394
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,239
I want to make it with egg white and yolk

395
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:58,359
What can I learn from reading ancient books recently

396
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,000
I used to think that snowflake crab bucket originated from hibiscus crab

397
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,560
Originally, the court of Song Dynasty began to cook slugs

398
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,920
In Yuan Dynasty, there were honey-brewed slugs

399
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,719
Maybe this is the source of snowflake crab fighting

400
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,800
Chinese diet has a long history

401
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,319
Extensive and profound

402
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,959
Spring and Autumn Period and Warring States Period

403
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,439
Shandong cuisine is fresh, salty and pure

404
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
Famous chefs come forth in large numbers

405
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,599
Shu cuisine originated from Chuanfu

406
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,000
One dish, one cube

407
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:32,160
Hundred dishes and flavors

408
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,280
Unique

409
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:38,599
Cantonese cuisine in the early Han Dynasty used a wide range of materials

410
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,119
Taste is delicious and pure

411
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,359
Gradually rise to fame

412
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,599
Fujian cuisine is good at cooking mountains and treasures

413
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,000
Walk alone in the world with soup

414
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,160
After Tang and Song Dynasties

415
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:55,359
Jiangsu and Zhejiang show simultaneously

416
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,079
Exquisite and elegant

417
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,280
Hold up half of the southern food

418
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Hunan vegetable oil is heavy in color, rich, smooth and fat

419
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,280
Anhui cuisine is based on

420
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,880
Tunxi pickled mandarin fish

421
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,199
Horseshoe turtle in sandy land

422
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,919
And is famous all over the world

423
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,320
Therefore, the world says

424
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,840
South sweet, north salty, east spicy and western acid

425
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,000
That's the truth

426
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,239
Good folk cooks are good at one school

427
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,479
What's more

428
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,439
Only one dish in one's life

429
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,040
Now it's up to you to sort out the names of the past dynasties

430
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,439
You should learn to learn from the past and the present

431
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,879
Mastery through a comprehensive study

432
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,760
Yes

433
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,760
Grass millet

434
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,199
Guo Bianfei sent someone to say

435
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,800
I took the donkey-hide glue paste you sent

436
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,560
Always have a dry throat

437
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,479
Abdominal distension and discomfort

438
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,120
Do you use aged donkey-hide gelatin

439
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,399
The anger of new Ejiao is too high

440
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,199
Only aged donkey-hide gelatin that can be annealed

441
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,320
To supply the master

442
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,439
How can I connect

443
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:59,080
I can't tell the difference between new and old donkey-hide gelatin

444
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,399
Hu Si Shan

445
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,040
You come with me

446
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,360
Chicken wine soup

447
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,120
Yes

448
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,479
Empress Zhuang Fei has cold hands and feet

449
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,879
I want to make soup with ginger chicken

450
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,439
Taste mellow nourishing

451
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,520
It also has the effect of dispelling cold

452
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,080
Jiangmi wine can stimulate appetite, promote fluid production, promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis

453
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,280
Especially suitable for parturients

454
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,520
But if you treat this cold hand and foot,

455
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,199
Sorghum liquor is more suitable

456
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,080
For example, Guo Bianfei

457
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,639
Deficiency is not affected by tonifying spleen deficiency and qi stagnation

458
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:53,959
It is better to clear and supplement first

459
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,919
Even aged donkey-hide gelatin can't be used easily

460
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,600
She refused to listen to advice

461
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,560
Will go wrong

462
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,399
Meng Shangshi actually cooked it himself

463
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,040
Yeah

464
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,239
I don't know what to do

465
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,199
It's so thin

466
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,040
What is Meng Shangshi going to do

467
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,080
I have no idea

468
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,679
It smells good

469
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,679
No matter how good it tastes

470
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,840
Poor appearance

471
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,080
Just the cooks

472
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,120
Can't be a kitchen

473
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
Have you all remembered it

474
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Yes

475
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:30,479
Sumatra Zhancheng, Siam

476
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:33,159
Envoys from Java and other countries will arrive in the capital in a few days

477
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,479
Stay in the hall

478
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
Your Majesty graciously gives a banquet

479
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,800
Guanglu Temple will organize a banquet for 3,000 people

480
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,199
As for Shangshi Bureau,

481
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Guanglu Temple has a life

482
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,320
Prepare daily meal lists for visiting envoys

483
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,399
That's great

484
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:01,800
Two four six eighty

485
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,040
Twelve fourteen

486
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,679
Two four six eight

487
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,239
Wrong number

488
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,879
Lord Zhao, let me have a word

489
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,239
Lord Zhao

490
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,239
Livestock sent by the delicacies department this month

491
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,080
Fruits and vegetables

492
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,120
It is 30% less than last month

493
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,679
Quantity of drinks delivered by the Good Brewing Department

494
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:44,719
It is also seriously inconsistent

495
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,239
Even charcoal firewood

496
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,360
The food utensils can't be compared at all

497
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,479
Wang Si's meal

498
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,600
Everything sent has a rule

499
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,040
It has always been exactly the same

500
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,600
I'm afraid Wang Sishan's eyes are full of flowers

501
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
If you don't believe me

502
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,040
You can check it on the spot

503
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
You have to check

504
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,120
Then let Meng Shangshi come in person

505
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,159
I don't have the free time

506
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:14,239
Wang Si's meal

507
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:22,679
Meng Shang Shi

508
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,919
Meng Shangshi, you are just in time

509
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,360
You give a comment on this principle

510
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,280
Undocumented and undocumented

511
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,040
Insist that there is a difference in the number

512
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,120
There is no such truth in the world

513
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,000
Zhao Sicheng worked hard

514
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,600
I took today's ingredients

515
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,439
Go

516
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:49,840
Meng Shang Shi

517
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,959
Come forward and choose the ingredients

518
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,639
Walk fast

519
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,360
Go

520
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,040
Take this

521
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,360
Meng Shang Shi

522
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,199
They buy ingredients from the folk

523
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't know how many people are greedy for ink

524
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,439
Now even go to Linyuan

525
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,800
Dare to deduct the supply of the inner government

526
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:11,520
Do you really want to sit back and watch

527
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,959
You know clearly

528
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
There are only 3,000 kitchens in Guanglu Temple

529
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:18,360
But there are more than 9,400 people on the list

530
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,719
They even hooked up with the food supervisor

531
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,120
False report of the monthly confession of the internal supervisor

532
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,320
It is even more one to ten

533
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,280
All right

534
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Guang Luqing Jing Quan and Shang Shanjian's Ten Thousand Palm Seals

535
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,760
Internal and external collusion embezzles internal property

536
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,520
And ten thousand handprints

537
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:36,879
It is the adopted son of Huang Yan, the eunuch in charge of Sili prison

538
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,840
You have to sue the monk food supervisor of Guanglu Temple

539
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:40,719
You can sue

540
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,520
Your Majesty's favorite eunuch

541
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,120
And

542
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,159
The inner official supervisor goes up and down

543
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,560
They are all his disciples and grandchildren

544
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,199
You can clean up all the eunuchs who closed the palace

545
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,399
Loosen

546
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,840
Meng Shang Shi

547
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,399
This is the food you are interested in

548
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,239
Meng Shang Shi

549
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
Pine mushroom is the king of fungi

550
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,080
It takes years to grow up

551
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:35,479
The taste is fragrant and fragrant

552
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,959
Such ingredients

553
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,439
Why is it not precious

554
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,199
Land of China

555
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,080
Top ingredients abound

556
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,760
The so-called hump bear's paw

557
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,280
Tricholoma matsutake bird's nest abalone ginseng fin

558
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,760
It's not worth mentioning at all

559
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:05,120
As a kitchen of Shangshi Bureau,

560
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,879
Discover unusual treasures

561
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,399
Just showed your own skills

562
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,239
Use all these things

563
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,120
Why should I make you

564
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,199
What the hell does this mean

565
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,800
I don't understand

566
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,800
Zi Jin

567
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,080
This

568
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,360
Ugly

569
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:40,800
With pimples in one's heart

570
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,760
What is this

571
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:55,239
Spinning is so hard

572
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:57,239
Why should mother do it herself

573
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,479
I'm used to it

574
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,719
I don't think it's bitter

575
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,639
Give it to me

576
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,199
Mother is unwell

577
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,560
Daughter-in-law should accompany and serve decoction day and night

578
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,360
But I didn't know it

579
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:33,639
Really disrespectful

580
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:35,679
I also asked my mother to forgive me

581
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,679
Brocade book

582
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,080
Please tell the empress

583
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,959
Order someone to invite the emperor and grandson

584
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:14,719
No

585
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:15,760
You go in person

586
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
You finally figured it out

587
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
The Crown Princess wants you to take medicine to recuperate your body

588
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,639
I am also looking forward to your early birth of children

589
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,280
When the temple comes down later

590
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:25,919
You can't stay cold any longer

591
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,479
Go ahead
