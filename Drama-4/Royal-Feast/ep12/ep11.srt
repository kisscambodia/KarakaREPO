1
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,639
Don't clip it

2
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,240
How is it

3
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
Hanwang always liked meat

4
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,160
It was my negligence

5
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,399
Your Excellency

6
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,440
We have just received orders, too

7
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:21,600
Lord Wang

8
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,360
Tonight, even the military forces of the five cities are dispatched

9
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,600
Who the hell are you going to take

10
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,039
Counter-insurgency

11
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,559
Come with me

12
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,959
Don't always look at me

13
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,320
It's hard to eat a piece of meat

14
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,000
What's the fun of being a man

15
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,679
Father, don't forget your business

16
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,880
Carassius auratus is thick in winter

17
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,760
Taste delicious

18
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,119
This painting was created by Mr. Yun Lin, a painter of the former dynasty

19
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,239
Crucian Carp Belly Soup

20
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
Take only two pieces of meat from the belly of the fish

21
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,640
Prepared with Zanthoxylum bungeanum

22
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,720
Extremely fresh and tender

23
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,679
Unique flavor

24
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
Fresh and tender lubrication

25
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,760
Melt at the entrance

26
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,799
When I was in my boudoir,

27
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,880
Mother often cooks crucian carp soup with her own hands

28
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,040
What's the matter

29
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:21,519
Recipe canon meal

30
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,519
Recipe canon meal

31
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Let Purple Azinge Replace Jade

32
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,399
No

33
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,799
Can't

34
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,600
If we lose to the supervisor tonight,

35
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,720
Everyone will be punished

36
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,160
Row

37
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,040
The next dish is Dinghu Shangsu

38
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,359
I know

39
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,359
Needle tip to wheat awn

40
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,760
Bird's Nest to Snow Ear

41
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,399
Just fit

42
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,519
You should accompany her to dress up quickly

43
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,239
Good

44
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,239
Go

45
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,399
Let's go

46
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,359
Let's go. Come on

47
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,079
Hurry up

48
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,959
Your Majesty

49
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,920
This dish is made of snow ears, yellow ears and stone ears

50
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,799
Made of fungus, elm ear, sweet-scented osmanthus ear and six ears

51
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,279
Combined with Nostoc flagelliforme and

52
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,839
Precious ingredients such as fresh lotus seeds are boiled together

53
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,160
It is rare to make it smooth and delicious

54
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,600
So again

55
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,480
Fresh and elegant

56
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,200
Take away

57
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,959
Don't withdraw yet

58
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,799
Yes

59
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,320
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill

60
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,239
It was just an oversight

61
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,600
Sovereign

62
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,000
I can't wait

63
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,519
When can I see him

64
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,799
You have to wait until after the family dinner

65
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:40,760
Emperor

66
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,200
Ten thousand handprint dishes are coming

67
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,480
It seems to have a refreshing bouquet

68
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,119
Blow on one's face

69
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,799
Your Majesty

70
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,720
This dish uses abalone, shark fin and ginseng

71
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,559
Twenty-eight kinds of ingredients such as Yaozhu deer tendon

72
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
It is simmered in an aged flower carved wine jar

73
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,960
The vegetables are slightly fragrant with wine

74
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:12,919
Oily but not greasy

75
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,359
Three things about the name of the dish, Fu Shou Quan

76
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,880
Meat fragrance around the tongue

77
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,479
The soup is rich

78
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,080
Endless aftertaste

79
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,119
I have never tasted such delicious food before

80
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,520
Good

81
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,520
Good luck, good luck and longevity

82
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,840
Grandpa Emperor

83
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,320
This is a good sign

84
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,960
Emperor Pu Cha

85
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,000
It's very delicious

86
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,960
Is

87
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,400
Grandpa Huang rarely has a big appetite

88
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,119
Looks like it's the crab soup

89
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,840
Crab sauce

90
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,520
Yeah

91
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,599
Crab meat is a very fresh thing in the world

92
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,760
Only the big armour

93
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,880
You can compete with Fu Shouquan in three things

94
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,599
But now is not the best season to eat crabs

95
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,119
Can't bring the delicious soup into full play

96
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,919
I'll use crab cream to mix tofu soup

97
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,520
Put the lightest and most delicious in the world

98
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,719
Combination of two ingredients

99
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,640
Neutralize the freshness of crab flavor with the clarity of tofu

100
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,840
To be just right

101
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,320
Crab sauce still has such an effect

102
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,039
That's no ordinary crab sauce

103
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,919
The fattest hairy crab in the middle and late September

104
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,679
Abandon crab meat

105
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,640
Take only crab cream and crab roe

106
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,880
Elaborate bald butter

107
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,760
Crisp, beautiful and fragrant

108
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,919
The best taste in the world

109
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,000
Which can be compared with ordinary crab sauce

110
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,799
And

111
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,400
That cup of tea

112
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:05,760
No wonder

113
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,599
Remove fishy smell and greasiness with ordinary tea

114
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,880
You can taste it with your tongue

115
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,039
The fragrance of tofu and the delicacy of crab sauce

116
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,320
Zi Jin

117
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,119
You are really good.

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,479
So how many wins and losses do we have now

119
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,479
What was our first game

120
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,479
They won the first game

121
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,119
They won

122
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:30,919
What about the second game

123
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,640
What happened in the second game

124
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,479
I don't know either

125
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,280
Why did you return it intact

126
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,719
Princess Han has asthma

127
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,119
Don't eat chicken all the year round

128
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,640
To avoid offending the princess

129
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,159
So I told someone to withdraw

130
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,359
What are you talking about

131
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,760
You say it again

132
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,840
What's the matter

133
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,200
What's the matter

134
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,919
Princess Han

135
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,239
Xiuzhen

136
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,479
Princess

137
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,359
Princess Xiuzhen

138
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:19,799
What's going on

139
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,080
Moon flower

140
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,599
What's the matter

141
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,000
You can't eat chicken clear

142
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,479
But my walnut fried kidney flower

143
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,479
Every waist flower

144
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,520
They are all soaked in chicken

145
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:42,599
Not good

146
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
The princess has a recurrence of a chronic disease

147
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,880
Xuan Tai Yi

148
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,919
Quick Xuan Tai Yi

149
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,880
Yes

150
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:04,599
Slow down

151
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,520
Sovereign please stay

152
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,119
Mother

153
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:12,679
The princess has a recurrence of a chronic disease

154
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:13,960
No delay

155
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,239
It is necessary to hurry to make a diagnosis and treatment by Xuan Tai Yi

156
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,599
Mother

157
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,440
You take people to your palace first

158
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Please send the medicine manager, too

159
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,840
Handmaiden is going to invite him

160
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,760
Go

161
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,400
Sovereign

162
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,400
Stand down

163
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,200
Father

164
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,159
What does this mean

165
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,039
Bring it up

166
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:06,960
Go

167
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,080
Quickly

168
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,159
Go

169
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,039
Kneel down

170
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,039
Your Majesty

171
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,159
Meng Xian, commander of Changshan Guard

172
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,960
Yulin avant-garde Peng Xu

173
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,960
Qin Tian Jian Guan Wang Shecheng

174
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,719
And the attendant Qing Yang and his son

175
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,960
All the rebels have been won

176
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,239
What crime have you committed

177
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,640
Grandpa Emperor

178
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:33,359
Wang Shecheng, the official of Qin Tianjian, conspired with Meng Xian

179
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,679
Said he had a different view of the sky recently

180
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,239
There will be a king in the world

181
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,599
And conspired to offer poisoned wine at the banquet

182
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,400
Waiting for an opportunity to poison your majesty

183
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,679
Soldiers rob the arsenal and Fu Bao of Neifu

184
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,440
Then win the six ministers of the five governments of Gonghou Bo

185
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,960
A fake imperial edict has been found

186
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,760
Fu Bao to be stamped

187
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,719
You can abolish the crown prince

188
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,159
Embrace the King of Zhao

189
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,679
Sure enough, he is my good son

190
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,280
I'm just occasionally infected with minor diseases

191
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,239
Can't look at the direction

192
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,359
Why do you remember

193
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:12,239
What about this dragon chair and his eldest brother's head

194
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:13,919
Third brother

195
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,479
The third child

196
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,479
Wake up

197
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,119
Third brother

198
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,799
The third child

199
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,599
Do you really collude with others to poison your father

200
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,960
Conspiracy to usurp the throne

201
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,880
I drink too much

202
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,400
Big Brother

203
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,479
What are you talking about

204
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,559
Say what

205
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,000
What's wrong with this

206
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,119
Why do you want to say this to your heart

207
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,239
My loyalty and filial piety to my father

208
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,000
That's where heaven and earth can show the sun and the moon can learn

209
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,640
How can I collude with people

210
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
What about plotting evil

211
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,280
Who said that

212
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,559
Is that you

213
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,080
Who instructed you to frame the king

214
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,719
Shut up

215
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,000
Down

216
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes

217
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:55,880
Yes

218
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:09,440
I said third

219
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,200
Chang Shanwei is your guard

220
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,719
Who can afford to transfer but you

221
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,919
Everyone was taken down and refused to recognize it

222
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,520
No

223
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,359
Father

224
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,599
I was greedy just now

225
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
I fell asleep

226
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,479
I don't know what happened

227
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,479
But someone must have planted it

228
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,000
I want to trap my son in injustice, my father

229
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,839
Let him drink it

230
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,880
Emperor

231
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,520
Go

232
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,359
His Royal Highness the King of Zhao

233
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,239
Since I know nothing,

234
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Why don't you dare to drink

235
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,400
Father

236
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,520
There are neither elite soldiers nor strong generals in my son's hand

237
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,000
The army is more selfless and close friends

238
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,199
My son is really alone

239
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,199
Stay in Beijing for several years

240
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:59,359
That's also half a step, I dare not step on the wrong line

241
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,880
That's a partisan in the army

242
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,079
Supported by military commanders

243
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,079
And who is it

244
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,599
The third child hurt me again

245
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,920
My son is wronged

246
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,680
In the early years of war,

247
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,599
My son has a life-long friendship with many military commanders

248
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,239
But they were all fought in hard battles

249
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,880
Since my son went to the fief,

250
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,719
There will be no contact with these military commanders

251
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:31,880
What's more, I don't know where to talk about the so-called support

252
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,040
To say that it is supported by courtiers

253
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,160
Who can compare with Big Brother in the world

254
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,640
Those sour civil servants in this court

255
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,839
That's not a prince's benevolence

256
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,119
Father and Father

257
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,719
My son wronged his father

258
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,199
All right, don't even say it

259
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:00,839
Father

260
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
This glass of wine today

261
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,319
My son is willing to drink

262
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,719
But before you drink it

263
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,119
My son must swear to heaven

264
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,239
I have no intention of committing insurrection

265
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,319
What happened today must be someone trying to frame up

266
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:17,880
Someone must be going after the yellowbird

267
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,239
Father

268
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,959
If you must use this glass of wine today

269
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,199
Words from proving innocence

270
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,560
My son is willing to do it

271
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,000
Father

272
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,560
Make one's father impossible

273
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,640
The third brother has always been humble and wise

274
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,359
Never disobey

275
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,920
This time it must be wronged and wronged

276
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,760
If this is a glass of poison wine

277
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,560
My son is willing to replace him with his own body

278
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,079
I'll do it

279
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,319
Big Brother

280
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:47,880
I'll do it

281
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,560
Big Brother

282
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,319
Third brother

283
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,119
Big Brother

284
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:50,640
Third brother

285
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,239
Big Brother

286
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:51,760
That's enough

287
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,800
Everyone wants to drink poisoned wine to prove innocence

288
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,959
Don't I dare to be alone

289
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,160
And I'm innocent

290
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:57,839
Come and give it to me

291
00:20:58,479 --> 00:20:58,959
Give it to me

292
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,239
That's enough

293
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,319
Grandpa Emperor

294
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,280
My grandson hasn't finished his words yet

295
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,920
Meng Xian Peng Xu

296
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,439
It's just a mere commander

297
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,880
How many soldiers can you have in your hand

298
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,520
To hijack the heavily guarded vault

299
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,160
It's simply nonsense

300
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,479
Two uncles are extremely clever

301
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,560
How could you do such a foolish thing

302
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,199
Grandchildren have already found out

303
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,719
It's just that those ignorant officials conspired

304
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,000
It has nothing to do with two uncles

305
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,319
Zhanji

306
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
You said so

307
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Third uncle is timid

308
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,400
You scared my uncle to death

309
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:40,920
Two uncles

310
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,479
You guys reacted too quickly

311
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,199
Before I finish speaking

312
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,640
Even if they are not behind the scenes,

313
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,760
It is also arrogant and indulgent on weekdays

314
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:56,119
Make a group of ministers greedy

315
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,800
Seek power and usurp the throne

316
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,599
Your Majesty, calm down

317
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,800
Imperial edict

318
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,199
Wang Shecheng is attractive by astronomical phenomena

319
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,920
Zhu

320
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,079
Other people involved, etc.

321
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,599
Xia Zhen Fu Si Prison Yan Shen

322
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,719
Handmaiden's decree

323
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,280
You two

324
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,920
Zhao Wang introspects behind closed doors

325
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:22,920
Yes

326
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,640
And you

327
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,680
Go back to your fief tomorrow

328
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,400
Thank your father

329
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,280
Han Wang to

330
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:41,880
Sister-in-law

331
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:58,719
Mother

332
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,920
Princess Han suffers from chronic diseases

333
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,680
Why don't you take care of the sick first

334
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
Stay in the fief and rest well

335
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,560
The dishes cooked by eight famous chefs in Shangshanjian

336
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,359
How did you know beforehand

337
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,880
And the walnut kidney flower

338
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,520
And who reminded you

339
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,119
Specially cooked with chicken clear

340
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,760
Chicken clear

341
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,839
Princess Han has always had old diseases

342
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,280
Take water wave eggs in the morning to recuperate your body

343
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,680
Fried kidney flower with walnut kernel in the food list

344
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,280
Cook with chicken clear as usual

345
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,560
It's him

346
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,479
Mother

347
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,520
You believe me

348
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,599
I really didn't do anything

349
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,719
I have never met Princess Han

350
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
I didn't know she had asthma

351
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,520
Mother

352
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,680
You believe me

353
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,719
Naturally, you don't want to murder Princess Han

354
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:57,760
You're just trying to set me up

355
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,640
What are you talking about

356
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,040
You clearly know that Princess Han relapsed and died of his old illness

357
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,479
I'm still the palm print of the Food Bureau

358
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,719
Can't escape dereliction of duty

359
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,119
This is not a deliberate framing. What is it

360
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,079
Dereliction of duty

361
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,760
So you're so angry

362
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,719
It's not because Princess Han is dead

363
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,839
I'm afraid of losing your position as a food eater

364
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,000
What you just said about him

365
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,680
Who on earth is it

366
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,880
Tell me

367
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,439
Say

368
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,520
Who the hell is ordering you

369
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,599
No one told me to

370
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I did it myself

371
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,199
I did it all

372
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,719
You are the handprint of Shang Food Bureau

373
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,599
People were killed on New Year's Eve

374
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,079
Naturally, you can't get away with it

375
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,079
I'm deliberate

376
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:53,319
Just want to see

377
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,079
The way you end up with nothing

378
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,239
Look at you, a woman who abandoned her husband and daughter

379
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,800
What will happen in the end

380
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,800
I did everything

381
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,880
I did it all

382
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,439
You're satisfied

383
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,760
You are so disappointing to me

384
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:09,959
Meng Shang Shi

385
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,880
Crown Princess summoned

386
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,880
Don't be polite

387
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:58,880
Grandpa Emperor

388
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,040
Rebellious minister's palace

389
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,520
It's a child's play to find out the rebellion edict

390
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,319
The third child

391
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,119
Be meticulous at ordinary times

392
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,040
How can you get the wind out in advance

393
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
One net into a capture

394
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,680
A Washington

395
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,560
If so

396
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,760
A treasure that arouses people's greed

397
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,319
The thief keeps on going

398
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,000
On the contrary

399
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,520
A ruined temple outside the city

400
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Except for cobwebs

401
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,520
Have nothing

402
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,199
Even

403
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,239
Rats don't want to patronize either

404
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,400
Imperial dragon chair power

405
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,079
How tempting

406
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,040
Your two uncles

407
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,880
While I am old and sick,

408
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,880
Collusion with internal officials

409
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,439
Interworking messages

410
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't care, they think

411
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,119
I am deaf and blind

412
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,959
Who told you to scare them

413
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,000
Grandpa Emperor

414
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,839
It is clear that you are scaring them

415
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,400
Bold

416
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,280
Grandchildren never wronged one person

417
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,280
I have fought more in my life

418
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,719
Decisive war

419
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,119
It is also strictly guarded against parents and children

420
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,800
The world often scolds me for being cruel and violent

421
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,680
What do you think

422
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:25,959
Say

423
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,560
When grandchildren are young

424
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Grandpa Huang once said

425
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,160
What is a leader

426
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,640
At first, when people hunted,

427
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,400
Elect the bravest man in the crowd

428
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,160
As a leader

429
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,520
And this man

430
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,359
Is the man who takes the most lives from the beast

431
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,560
Take up arms and organize an army

432
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,239
Protect tribes and food

433
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,560
This is the leader

434
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,880
The tribe is still like this

435
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,319
What's more, a country

436
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,680
Ordinary people want to be good people

437
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,119
Doing good deeds and accumulating virtues is

438
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,959
But for emperors,

439
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,079
Adhere to the road of benevolence and righteousness blindly

440
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,280
Will only become a mediocre emperor

441
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,319
What do you think is a good emperor

442
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,079
For the people

443
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,280
For the country

444
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:10,640
Benevolence and righteousness can be abandoned

445
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
To give up one's own flesh and blood

446
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,680
Even if you are reviled by thousands of people, you have to endure it

447
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,160
Adhere to the right path of the country

448
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,160
Defend one's territory and people

449
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,119
This is the emperor

450
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,040
You always care about your family

451
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,599
Leave room for them

452
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,479
Is that glass of wine poisonous

453
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,000
Even if it is highly toxic,

454
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,160
It only poisons the heart of rebellion

455
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,959
Poison can't defeat the real dragon emperor

456
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,719
Come

457
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,680
Walk with Grandpa

458
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,160
Crown Princess

459
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,959
What happened at the New Year's Eve banquet

460
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,560
It's all the handmaiden's fault

461
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,760
Handmaiden is willing to be punished

462
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,199
Don't defend yourself

463
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,920
Handmaiden is a humble person

464
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,839
Rely on the protection of the Crown Princess

465
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,680
To have a place to stand today

466
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,959
It should have been a grass-bearing ring to repay your kindness

467
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,079
I made a mistake at the New Year's Eve banquet

468
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,160
Let the villain take the opportunity to make trouble

469
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,479
This is the end of the matter

470
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:37,520
What face is there to defend before you

471
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,280
Meng Shang Shi

472
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,280
Who do you mean by the villain

473
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,160
People who are familiar with propriety and righteousness in the world

474
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,199
It should be understood that monarch, minister and father and son

475
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,839
The principle of being superior and inferior from top to bottom

476
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,520
I won't make a humble offense and respect the following offenses

477
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,640
Slaves are lax in royal affairs

478
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,160
Blindly tolerant and patient

479
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,359
Let the villain push his luck and wait for an opportunity to make trouble

480
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,760
One over here

481
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,719
Meng Shang Shi

482
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,319
Hu Si Shan

483
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,000
Handmaiden serves the Lord wholeheartedly

484
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,079
Forget the hidden dangers close at hand

485
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,520
The food list has not been checked again

486
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,760
Give the villain a chance to form a trap

487
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,439
It was the handmaiden's mistake

488
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,839
This is over two

489
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,479
It's just that handmaiden is deeply gracious

490
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,400
Have to dare to speak out

491
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,880
A man who can betray Shangguan so easily

492
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,079
How can you be trusted

493
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,239
How can you stay around

494
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,000
Imperial Doctor has treated Princess Han

495
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,920
Said she was suffering from chronic diseases

496
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,560
This time, despite dissuasion, I came to Beijing for a long distance

497
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,160
So that the old disease recurs

498
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,119
There is no way to return to heaven

499
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,280
There is nothing wrong with the food list prepared by Guanglu Temple

500
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:45,959
There is no big mistake for the Food Bureau to make meals according to the order

501
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,920
Besides, Your Majesty appreciates the crab soup very much

502
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,119
The right to make meals still belongs to the Food Bureau

503
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:57,359
If the food bureau has nothing to do with the death of the princess,

504
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,959
And why

505
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,880
Someone tipped off

506
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,719
You sent a private message to Hanwang

507
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,800
You can plead guilty

508
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,280
This is a false accusation

509
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,520
Hu Si Shan

510
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,920
How dare you say anything in front of your master without evidence

511
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,119
Handmaiden visits Crown Princess

512
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,160
That day in Ganqing Palace

513
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,239
Witnessed Lord Yuan being expelled from the hall

514
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,920
Meng Shangshi once talked about your majesty taking elixir

515
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,079
Dragon's body is unsafe

516
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,640
It is also asserted that there will be changes in the palace

517
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,760
Handmaiden thought afterwards

518
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,479
Fear in one's heart

519
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,880
Don't dare not report it

520
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,479
Meng Shang Shi

521
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,839
If it weren't for the news of having an affair with Hanwang

522
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,599
How can you know that there will be changes in the palace

523
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,280
Pay attention to everything

524
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,839
You can see the micro-knowledge

525
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,359
Crown Princess

526
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,000
Zu Xun has long said clearly

527
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,119
Female officials of empresses and concubines in every palace

528
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,839
Do not interfere in all affairs outside the palace gate

529
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,160
Meng Shang's private glimpse of the Lord is a great sin

530
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,800
Not to mention repeatedly passing messages with the captaincy

531
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,040
Besides, she used to repay the grace of Han Wang

532
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,520
Contrary to your will

533
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,000
Meng Shang Shi

534
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,599
Anyone who writes a post privately has an affair with the outside world

535
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,040
Writers are cut when they receive them

536
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,239
You are still eating in the palace

537
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,719
Knowing to commit a crime

538
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,239
What sin should I commit

539
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,479
If you want to add a crime, you can't say anything

540
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,239
Crown Princess

541
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:45,800
You are wise and wise

542
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,160
I actually believe this provocative statement

543
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,520
Doubt my loyalty

544
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,400
Over the years

545
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
You serve Your Majesty

546
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,959
Preside over the Shang Food Bureau

547
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,800
It's also a dedicated effort

548
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,520
Crown Princess

549
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,400
But you peep at the Lord and talk about palace changes

550
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,400
Words and deeds do exceed the rules

551
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,359
Sin is unforgivable

552
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:04,839
According to palace rules

553
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,239
Take away the job of still eating

554
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,400
Go to Gongzhengsi to get the crime by yourself

555
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,040
Take care of yourself in the future

556
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
The handmaiden said goodbye

557
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,119
Wanwang Crown Princess Treasures

558
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,280
Congratulations

559
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,199
Meng Shang Shi

560
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,520
Now it's no longer a food

561
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,959
How will I address you in the future

562
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,760
I'm curious

563
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,400
I trust you so much and reuse you

564
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,640
Why did you take refuge in her

565
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,479
Enter the palace from a young age

566
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,400
We are best friends

567
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,520
Later, he entered the Shang Food Bureau

568
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,920
Because you are overbearing and suspicious

569
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,439
Anyone who doesn't agree with you

570
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,199
Try to suppress expulsion

571
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,640
In order to blind your eyes, we

572
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,560
I've been pretending to be at odds

573
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,319
Ten years

574
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,719
You've been pretending in front of me for ten years

575
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,760
It's great

576
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,839
A Wai

577
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:43,920
Don't be soft-hearted

578
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,360
I know

579
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,959
In addition to acting overbearing, she

580
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,560
Be fair and just

581
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,360
But as long as there is her in one day,

582
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:53,320
I will never get out of the head

583
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,479
In the past ten years,

584
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,040
She has always been absolute monarch

585
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,919
We are obviously the best friends

586
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:02,320
But always pretend to be discord

587
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Don't you have a hard time

588
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,439
In the future

589
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,320
I don't need it anymore

590
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,520
Wake up, wake up, wake up

591
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,080
Everyone is safe and sound

592
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,280
Safe, safe, safe

593
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,320
Great, great

594
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:40,959
It's good to be okay

595
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,239
That's great

596
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,399
It's all right at last

597
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,560
It's okay it's okay

598
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,040
I was scared to death just now

599
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,719
What's going on

600
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,320
Do you still have to be held accountable

601
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,399
Come on, come on

602
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:33,560
Come and come

603
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:45,560
I wish adults good health

604
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:47,520
Everything means everything

605
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,320
Wish you good luck

606
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,959
Everything goes smoothly

607
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,639
Hurry up, hurry up

608
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,080
Come

609
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,080
Come

610
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,360
Thank you

611
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,199
Thank you, thank you, thank you

612
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,239
Be careful of burning

613
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:08,879
Come

614
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,080
So delicious

615
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,560
Come and come

616
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,679
Get me some vinegar

617
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,679
Zi Jin

618
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,360
The new year is safe and smooth

619
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,479
May you be as lucky as you desire

620
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,320
Reward you

621
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:06,560
Thank you, Your Highness

622
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,040
All the blessings of the Forbidden City

623
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,679
It's all in this bowl of flat food

624
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,919
I'll eat first

625
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,919
Your Highness has something on his mind

626
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:22,639
Some things

627
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,560
I have a plan in mind

628
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,360
Be comfortable

629
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,719
But there are some things

630
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,439
I haven't tried it either

631
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,479
I don't know what to do with it

632
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:39,520
Your Highness

633
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,800
There is no blessing at all

634
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:45,439
It's empty

635
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,479
But I followed your highness

636
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,040
Is my greatest blessing

637
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,479
It's you

638
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,280
Why did you set me up

639
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,719
We have no grievances and no enmity

640
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:16,399
How could you

641
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,280
It's a fair deal

642
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,600
You did something for me

643
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,679
And I also got the meal list of the supervisor for you

644
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,199
Do you know that

645
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,600
I became a murderer because of you

646
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,479
It's all your fault

647
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:38,479
Don't come over

648
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:39,959
Go away

649
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,199
Who hurt you

650
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:03,800
What's the matter? This is

651
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,399
You mean to be unhappy, don't you

652
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,800
Just like your mother who killed people

653
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,080
My mother didn't kill anyone

654
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,320
Daughter of a criminal woman

655
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,679
How dare you talk back

656
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
You see I won't hit you

657
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,679
You come here

658
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,280
See if I don't hit you

659
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,199
See if I don't hit you

660
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,600
My mother didn't kill anyone

661
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,840
Telling you to talk back didn't kill anyone

662
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,760
I told you to talk back

663
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:24,800
You fought back

664
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:27,080
You're right

665
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:32,760
I'm not unaware

666
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,159
But pretend not to know

667
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:36,919
I just want to know

668
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,120
If I stand in danger,

669
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,679
Will anyone notice

670
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:54,199
I always follow the rules. If I do something wrong,

671
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:58,040
Is there anyone willing to understand

672
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,679
Even one person is fine

673
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,199
It's just that I didn't think of it

674
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,439
This error

675
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,520
At the cost of human life

676
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,040
It's my choice

677
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,600
Have nothing to do with others

678
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,919
Off you go

679
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,159
You can hate me as much as you like

680
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,120
Only in the future

681
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,399
Don't put others

682
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:39,679
As your hope to live

683
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,840
How did you get out

684
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,840
Walk in

685
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,560
What are you doing

686
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,040
Yuehua hasn't come back yet

687
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,320
You care about her

688
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,159
It's freezing. Get in there

689
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,080
You know everything

690
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:34,280
Except for you

691
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,520
Who has the courage to openly attack the princess

692
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:38,760
It's too presumptuous

693
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:40,000
I told you

694
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,800
Never let go of the initiator

695
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,320
She regrets this matter to this day

696
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,600
I came to see you this time

697
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,879
You bastard

698
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,399
It seems that you won't go back with me either

699
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,600
Accompanying a gentleman is like accompanying a tiger

700
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,439
But today our emperor

701
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
The most annoying thing is to be smart

702
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,280
You take care of yourself

703
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,760
After I left Beijing,

704
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,879
You don't have to deliver a message

705
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:28,399
Just take care of yourself

706
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,399
My father's teachings have been remembered by my son

707
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,919
There are also official duties

708
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:33,040
One step ahead
