1
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,201
Why is it so late

2
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:28,881
Meng Shang Shi

3
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:31,881
Recipe canon meal

4
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,360
Make an inventory

5
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,320
Meng Shang Shi

6
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,320
You this

7
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,481
How can you be confused

8
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,441
Why is it still called Lord Shang Shi

9
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:43,961
Let me count it with you

10
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,801
Vegetables delivered today

11
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,041
It doesn't seem very fresh

12
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,720
The food delivered is not fresh

13
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:01,480
How did Aunt Meng forget

14
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,801
You used to say it yourself

15
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,360
Fresh vegetables

16
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,480
It takes less than an hour from picking to cooking

17
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,200
Sometimes it comes in a hurry

18
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
The dew hasn't dried yet

19
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,920
But you see

20
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,881
Sorry

21
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,321
Excuse me, you are affected

22
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,961
Go back and change to another car and come back

23
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,601
Wen Dian Shan this

24
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:26,640
Don't cut it

25
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,200
Walk, walk

26
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,920
Wen Dianshan bullied Aunt Meng again

27
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:42,241
Don't go

28
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,200
I'll take this

29
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,720
Meng Shang eats such a woman with such a mind

30
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,681
Why do others need sympathy and pity

31
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:01,720
Let's work hard

32
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,161
Let me do it

33
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,000
White has a pair of eyes

34
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,601
So regardless of honor or inferiority

35
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:41,560
Let's go

36
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:47,761
Moon flower

37
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,720
Next time I meet Meng Shangshi

38
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,400
Don't be so rude

39
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,560
Hu Sishan is now in charge of Shangshi Bureau

40
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,400
It's only a matter of time before you get promoted to still eat

41
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,441
Why care about unrelated people

42
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,280
Miss Yao, you're here

43
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,240
Please wait a moment

44
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,161
Yes

45
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:30,881
I'll wait

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,680
Lord Yang

47
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,240
Your Highness is still deliberating

48
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,201
Is there any way for the household department

49
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,601
I don't know

50
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,081
Where did your highness get the news

51
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:40,481
Royal Guards reported it

52
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,201
Royal Guards Vocational College Guard

53
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,761
Local disasters don't seem to be their concern

54
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,761
Listen to everything

55
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
If they hadn't interviewed the people's feelings,

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,481
The household department doesn't know when to hide it

57
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,761
Or Hejian Prefecture deliberately concealed it

58
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:56,641
This

59
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:36,280
If you don't wake up,

60
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:37,840
I kissed

61
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,361
Your Highness

62
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,560
Handmaiden Lost Manners

63
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,081
Your Highness, please forgive me

64
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:58,601
There are so many places where you lose your sight

65
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,641
First, I fell asleep halfway through the meal delivery

66
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,240
Second, it is too overstepping

67
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,960
I'm so tired that I hug you myself

68
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:08,960
Anyway, I don't forgive

69
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,361
Bearer

70
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,321
Pull out the staff and blame twenty

71
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:14,761
Your Highness

72
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:16,161
Your Highness

73
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:17,840
Be afraid

74
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:19,201
See clearly

75
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
This is the way the master treats the handmaiden

76
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,361
Raise one's head

77
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,361
Handmaiden dare not

78
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,240
Put your head up

79
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,201
I order you to look up immediately

80
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,881
Like

81
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,040
Why did you fall asleep just now

82
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,360
Handmaiden

83
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:12,401
Tell the truth

84
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,040
In order to prepare for the New Year's Eve banquet,

85
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:17,360
The handmaiden didn't sleep a wink for four days

86
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,841
This is true of the whole food bureau

87
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
So hard

88
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,401
Let's transfer you to the study

89
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:25,480
No

90
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:28,761
Handmaiden daring

91
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,281
Your Highness, please allow the handmaiden

92
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,761
Stay in Shangshi Bureau

93
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,000
Good

94
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,521
Unless you promise me one thing

95
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,841
From now on

96
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,040
Don't talk about your handmaiden and handmaiden

97
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:44,721
And you told me

98
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,721
Why do you like cooking so much

99
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:50,961
Your Highness

100
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,480
My mother had high expectations of me when I was young

101
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,800
Always ask the master to teach strictly

102
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:01,281
Can't remember the piano score

103
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,201
That's going to be beaten

104
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,841
At that time

105
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,761
The kitchen is the only one for me

106
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,321
Where you can avoid rattan

107
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:17,721
Because the place is small

108
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:18,721
Duoduo porcelain

109
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,560
It is inconvenient to swing the rattan

110
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,201
During this time in Shangshi Bureau,

111
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,841
Is the easiest thing in my life

112
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,120
The happiest time

113
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,441
Over there

114
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,480
Get the recognition of others for the first time

115
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,480
I also found the meaning of my own existence

116
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,040
Your Highness

117
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,800
Let this time last a little longer

118
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,841
I thought

119
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,321
Your happiest time is in the study

120
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
It seems that I think too much

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,641
Your Highness

122
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,560
That's totally different

123
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,081
Your Highness, when dealing with government affairs,

124
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,201
When leading the troops to fight,

125
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
Is it another kind of satisfaction

126
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,680
And carefree

127
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:10,881
Good

128
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,321
Give me a caress

129
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,040
Yes

130
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,160
You guys wait here

131
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,401
Your Highness clearly refused to allow musicians to enter the study

132
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,000
Who is playing the piano here

133
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:55,961
This is the piano score written by His Highness himself

134
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,841
Originally only half

135
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,000
The other half

136
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,401
Your Highness said that without the state of mind at that time,

137
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,961
I didn't expect it to be renewed today

138
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:06,521
Screen drawing

139
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,641
Go and find out who is in the study

140
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,680
I want to see her

141
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,761
Right

142
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,800
Know who is so bold

143
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:15,761
You can't be lenient

144
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,480
Hu Shang Shi

145
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:37,841
Hu Shang Shi

146
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,560
Zi Jin

147
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,841
Have you finished sorting out the list of medicinal diets in the past dynasties

148
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,401
Yes

149
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:47,761
It can be finished tomorrow

150
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,961
What is this doing

151
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,600
On that day, Tai Sun Fei happened to be at the banquet

152
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,160
I tasted the meal made by Zihao

153
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,920
Tell her to make snacks and send them over

154
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,321
To make such delicious food

155
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,600
She must be a woman with a bright mind

156
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:31,040
Can you play chess

157
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,160
Yao palm meal

158
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,081
I invite you here today

159
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:52,281
Actually it is

160
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,321
Tai Sun Fei

161
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:55,000
Please

162
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,441
I'm losing again

163
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,360
Come and play chess with me when you are free in the future

164
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:30,521
Xie Tai Sun Fei

165
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,641
Handmaiden leaves first

166
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,040
Screen drawing

167
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,721
You said this Yao girl

168
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:05,721
What kind of person is it

169
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,920
This handmaiden can't tell

170
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,881
So kind and kind

171
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,641
I'm not a man

172
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,881
It will also give birth to closeness

173
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,920
What's more, the emperor and grandson

174
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:20,480
Tai Sun Fei

175
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you really want her to serve your highness

176
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,721
Now someone can make your highness happy

177
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,240
Is to atone for my sins

178
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,761
Read me that poem again

179
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:36,841
Big Brother

180
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,680
Not that you used to say

181
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,081
You don't have to weigh your words in reading

182
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,920
As long as you understand the great sense of justice

183
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,241
I don't have to take a fame test

184
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,201
The desert is lonely and smoky

185
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:48,201
Long river falling yen

186
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:50,201
Three-year-olds can recite it

187
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,481
Look at you

188
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,760
A few words are wrong

189
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,121
It's solitary smoke, not smoke from kitchen chimneys

190
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,201
It's sunset, not steamed bun

191
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,601
Big Brother

192
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,040
I draw the sunset

193
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:01,920
You see

194
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,160
There is still glow here

195
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:05,640
Zhu Zhanyan

196
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,081
You're going to piss me off

197
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:18,880
Hurry up, hurry up

198
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,001
Come on, come on, keep up

199
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:35,241
Emperor

200
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,800
His Royal Highness Emperor Taisun

201
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,721
Grandpa Emperor

202
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:44,841
Today is the Shangyuan Festival

203
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,001
Ministers are waiting for you to visit Long Live Mountain

204
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:48,880
Why did you come here alone

205
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,760
The emperor is not in Ganqing Palace

206
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:56,121
Everyone is looking around the Forbidden City

207
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,760
Why only you know where I am

208
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:03,201
This war horse followed Grandpa Huang for more than ten years

209
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,760
I heard that he is ill today

210
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:07,880
Presumably, Grandpa Huang will come to visit in person

211
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,880
It's not sick

212
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:12,760
Is old

213
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,560
Grandpa Emperor

214
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,841
Remember the Dragon Boat Festival banquet that year

215
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,601
You hit the ball and shoot willow

216
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,081
Force the pack

217
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,280
Ministers, foreign emissaries were amazed

218
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:29,081
I also made a pair

219
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,760
Wanfang Yubo Fengyunhui

220
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,241
Grandchildren still remember that the lower couplet is

221
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,601
Unify the mountains and rivers, the sun and the moon

222
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,280
What a unified mountain and river, the sun and the moon are bright

223
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,961
There is such heroic spirit at the age of fourteen

224
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:07,520
Brush next

225
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,800
Zhan Ji

226
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,800
After the festival

227
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,280
Get out of the palace and do me a job

228
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:32,520
Everybody be careful

229
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,201
Quickly

230
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:22,640
Zi Jin

231
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
Nine-story archway lights were erected in Ganqing Palace

232
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
It's tall and beautiful

233
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,601
Let's go see it

234
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:28,241
Go quickly

235
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,920
I'm not going

236
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:31,121
You don't like it

237
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:33,680
Qiongyuan also has acrobatics and illusion performances

238
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,201
There is also a bow of Qiyun Society

239
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:36,160
It's lively

240
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:39,001
The Crown Princess finally gave everyone a day off

241
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,280
Don't you stay here

242
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,441
Ziping, I really won't go

243
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:42,760
Go, go, go

244
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,800
It's lively

245
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,841
Let's go. Let's go

246
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:48,760
Let's join in the fun, too

247
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,680
Don't do it yet

248
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,121
Let's do it tomorrow

249
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,640
Don't worry about this first

250
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:53,560
Let's go let's go

251
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,321
Let's go let's go let's go

252
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,321
There will be more people later

253
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,201
Hurry up, hurry up

254
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,361
Hurry up and join us

255
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:28,441
Moon flower

256
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:35,321
Princess Han died unfortunately

257
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:37,361
Stop blaming yourself

258
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,081
Master

259
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,160
I didn't kill anyone

260
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,081
I didn't

261
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:46,961
Master knows

262
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:51,001
None of this is your fault

263
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,201
I really didn't kill anyone

264
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:56,601
I didn't kill anyone

265
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,841
Master knows

266
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,001
Master knows that

267
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,961
Give it to me give it to me

268
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:18,880
This way

269
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:31,841
Into

270
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,601
Good

271
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,321
Come again and again

272
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:37,721
Go on, go on, go on

273
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:47,081
Attachment prevention point

274
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:47,841
Over there over there

275
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:50,841
To

276
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,441
Come and give it to me

277
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:54,560
One past this way

278
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:55,481
Good

279
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:57,481
Attachment prevention point

280
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,081
Good

281
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:03,441
Come again

282
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:06,760
Come and follow

283
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:21,081
How awesome

284
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:22,081
To continue

285
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,441
None of them are useful

286
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,160
You play with me

287
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:25,920
Pass it over, pass it over

288
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:31,160
Purple Azolla

289
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:32,601
The Crown Princess had a word first

290
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,880
Regardless of identity on the court

291
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,680
Just on winning or losing

292
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,361
Wu Cairen, she has a charming temper

293
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:39,961
You go on stage and let her

294
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:41,361
Remember

295
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:44,841
I'm calling you. Come here quickly

296
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,081
Go

297
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,040
Go ahead

298
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:49,961
Give it to me

299
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:51,800
Watch out for her

300
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,160
Give it to me

301
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:01,601
Miss Yao

302
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,241
Have you seen Empress Zhuang Fei

303
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:06,400
Empress Zhuang Fei

304
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,201
To

305
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,481
She

306
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:13,441
I looked everywhere

307
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:14,481
There is no figure

308
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
Could you help me find it

309
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,160
Don't say anything

310
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:18,400
Yes

311
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:19,321
Then

312
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:22,481
This way this way this way

313
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:31,001
Stop her

314
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:32,400
Come on

315
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:41,640
Catch

316
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,201
Continue

317
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,520
Come here

318
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:55,601
Quick, quick, quick

319
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:56,560
Guard against her

320
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:01,841
Come again and again

321
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,081
Empress Zhuang Fei

322
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:36,361
Today's Shangyuan Festival

323
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:37,800
I

324
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:40,760
Empress

325
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:45,361
Kim is looking for you everywhere

326
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:49,361
Thank you very much

327
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:51,280
I'm here

328
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:53,800
Empress Zhuang Fei

329
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:54,920
Empress

330
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,880
Madam

331
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:10,201
This way, please

332
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,961
Then let's go and have a look

333
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:15,841
Watch your step

334
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,481
What did you do wrong

335
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,201
The one just now

336
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,481
It's Mrs. Peng Chengbo, the mother of the Crown Princess

337
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,201
Being the most strict

338
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
If she bumps into her

339
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:44,760
You sneaked out to join in the fun

340
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:46,760
You must be severely punished

341
00:27:51,441 --> 00:27:52,040
Lord You

342
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:55,400
Today, the female official has a day off

343
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,201
Permission to come out to see the celebration

344
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,961
But why is Lord You here

345
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
As a royal eagle dog,

346
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,280
What's the errand

347
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:07,040
It's more important than staying by the emperor's sickbed

348
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:09,160
Everyone in the palace

349
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,920
Crying Zhuang Fei

350
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,520
And you

351
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,001
A female official covered in secrets

352
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,040
Every word and deed is recorded in the book

353
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:18,640
So

354
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,361
Don't make mistakes

355
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,121
Your Excellency

356
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,280
Can you and I know each other before

357
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,680
Of course not

358
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:31,201
What are you doing standing there

359
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:32,601
Don't go yet

360
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,081
Attachment prevention point

361
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,321
Guard against her

362
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:04,520
Prevent

363
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,280
Come again and again

364
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,841
Come

365
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,081
Quickly

366
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,520
Here, here, here

367
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:22,081
Pass it over

368
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,280
Here here

369
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:25,560
Here

370
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:27,760
Stop her

371
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,241
You sit

372
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:38,601
Then

373
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:49,241
Come again and again

374
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,441
This way this way

375
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
There are illusion performers in the square over there

376
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,560
Why don't Taisunfei accompany me to have a look

377
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,841
Go ahead

378
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:19,841
Pay attention to defense

379
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,520
Then I'll have a look, too

380
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,081
Less company

381
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,520
Give it to me

382
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,560
Come here

383
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:54,361
She is a gentle and kind child

384
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,520
Mother, why do you have to

385
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,040
In the world

386
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,201
Who would be better than the girl I picked myself

387
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,160
You've all met her

388
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,680
Even the emperor himself promised the marriage

389
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,201
Everybody knows

390
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,400
She is the real great grandson

391
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:15,040
Who knows your majesty listens to the alchemist

392
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:16,880
Go back on one's word

393
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,121
I changed this woman

394
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,001
Married for so long

395
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:21,920
Have never given birth to children

396
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,920
Return good fortune

397
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,601
She is an unlucky woman at all

398
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,040
Far less than

399
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,640
Mother

400
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:37,601
Go

401
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,400
Come and give it to me in the back

402
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,361
Come again and again

403
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:57,760
Go

404
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,880
Your Highness

405
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:01,841
The holy man invites you to watch the lights on the tower

406
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,760
You disappeared in a blink of an eye

407
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:06,081
Let the Holy One know that it is time to punish you again

408
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,160
Your Highness

409
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,880
Today is the Lantern Festival

410
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:11,040
The ladies-in-waiting all went to see the lights

411
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:12,121
Miss Yao must not have come

412
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,961
You see

413
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,920
What did I say

414
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:24,160
Didn't come

415
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,001
Your Highness

416
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:31,321
Your Highness

417
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:31,800
Don't follow

418
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,201
Good good

419
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:42,760
You see

420
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:43,800
How awesome

421
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:47,920
Good

422
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:51,201
One more

423
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,880
Good

424
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:46,721
Your Highness

425
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:54,640
I think it seems to like you very much

426
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,721
I've brought so many pets

427
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:18,520
Only treat it closest

428
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,400
Comb and feed it yourself

429
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,800
But it treats me most MoMo

430
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,361
And every day, MoMo

431
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,520
Your Highness loves many pets

432
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,040
Presumably, it is not rare for a raccoon slave to be close

433
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,160
You're not an inkstone

434
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:41,201
How do you know

435
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,561
In my opinion

436
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:43,961
It just has no conscience

437
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:48,880
I just know

438
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,400
How do you know

439
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:52,160
Does Your Highness know

440
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,680
The inkstone is a raccoon slave

441
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,680
My name is Ali, too

442
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,241
I heard that folk children grow up safely

443
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:02,281
Will have a cheap name

444
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,201
That's an interesting name

445
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,880
Your Highness

446
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,441
I'll go back first

447
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:13,080
I'm leaving Beijing

448
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,241
Since Daming moved its capital to Beijing

449
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
South-to-North Grain Transfer

450
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,521
Reopening Huitong River

451
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,600
Earth dam that can be built

452
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,600
Be destroyed by water every year

453
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,481
Annual repair is overburdened

454
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,761
This time, Grandpa Huang ordered me to inspect the river workers

455
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,360
Supervise and repair river course

456
00:35:34,721 --> 00:35:35,680
I don't know when I can return to Beijing

457
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,680
Go with me

458
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:42,880
Your Highness

459
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:44,920
I'm here

460
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,441
Waiting for you to return

461
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,360
Yao Ziliao

462
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,761
How many secrets are you hiding in your heart

463
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,840
Go play

464
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:17,521
Go ahead

465
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:19,761
I went to play, Your Highness

466
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,160
Who is it

467
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,160
Purple Azolla

468
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:09,320
What's the matter

469
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,320
Why are you here

470
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:13,320
Purple Azolla

471
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,761
Purple Azolla

472
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:27,481
I let her go everywhere

473
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,961
But she is adamant

474
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
See I won in the end

475
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,561
Tell someone to stop me in private

476
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:33,801
Thirty slaps

477
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,840
Anything you say

478
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,561
Don't make trouble

479
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:38,600
Don't fight back

480
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,600
But these noble people on high

481
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,281
We are not treated as human beings at all

482
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:43,961
I'm not reconciled

483
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,160
I'm so unwilling

484
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,201
Take it

485
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,241
Smash it

486
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,920
What a pity

487
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,801
Your Highness

488
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,201
You draw so well here

489
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,120
Why did you tear it up

490
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:50,320
Not like

491
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,360
Not like

492
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,600
How can I

493
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,481
Your Highness

494
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:54,241
That hand of yours

495
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:55,360
Miaoshou Danqing

496
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:59,201
Then what kind of flowers, birds, fish and insects, famous mountains and rivers

497
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,801
What about all the paintings

498
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,160
How could it not be

499
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:04,400
Business matters

500
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,600
Stay in the Forbidden City if you are in love with your children

501
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:10,481
Right

502
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:13,360
Your Highness, the horses and chariots are ready

503
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,920
Your Highness

504
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,521
This is the ninth year of Yongle

505
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:13,400
The new dam built by Song Li when he was ordered to harness the river

506
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,201
This is the position

507
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,880
Since then

508
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,360
Boats come and go on the Jeju River

509
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,041
An endless stream

510
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:22,400
Here is the part that was washed away by the flood

511
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,320
It uses the old transportation road dug in Yuan Dynasty

512
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:25,561
You see

513
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:31,561
Your Highness uses tea

514
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,160
Just in time

515
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,320
You can have extra meals tonight

516
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,201
Stay in the Forbidden City if you are in love with your children

517
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:26,080
Miss Yao

518
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:30,281
Thank you very much

519
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,880
Here

520
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,281
Father

521
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,080
Xia Yuanji is right

522
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:34,320
Compared with the old teacher, there is no work

523
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:37,120
Army and Horse Savings Ten Lost Eight Nine

524
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,840
He tried to block your northward expedition

525
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:42,640
It is out of patriotism and sympathy for the people

526
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:46,160
It's offensive to speak in a hurry

527
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,281
I also hope that my father will see that he has been an official for 20 years

528
00:43:50,521 --> 00:43:52,001
The point of loving the people with one heart and one mind

529
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,160
Give him a break

530
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,640
He is dedicated to caring for the people

531
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:58,880
Then I am

532
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,961
A belligerent bad king

533
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,441
Father

534
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,281
My son has no such intention

535
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,001
This man must be killed

536
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,481
Your Highness

537
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,521
Arutai committed a crime against me in Datong Kaiping

538
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,920
The holy man insisted on the northern expedition

539
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,360
Xia Daren, the minister of the household department, resisted

540
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:20,441
Speaking of going out for years,

541
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:21,521
Insufficient food and pay for troops and horses

542
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,920
The holy man flew into a rage

543
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:25,160
Adult Xia and Cheng Zou Shiyan of Dali Temple

544
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,961
They are all in prison

545
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,481
Fang Bin, the minister of the Ministry of War, also committed suicide in fear

546
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,920
Your Highness

547
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:34,640
The wrath of the holy dragon

548
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,561
You dissuade me

549
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:36,441
Be careful

550
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,160
Grandpa Emperor

551
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:44,481
The grandson is back

552
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,761
Why did you bring him back again

553
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,920
Tell you

554
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,400
Xia Yuanji must die

555
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,360
I want to kill him

556
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,120
It's no use persuading anyone

557
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:56,041
And copy his whole family

558
00:44:56,801 --> 00:44:57,880
I'd like to see it

559
00:44:58,241 --> 00:45:01,041
Keep saying clean and patriotic

560
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,120
Household ministers who love the people like children

561
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,640
What is the incorruptible law

562
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:05,761
Father

563
00:45:05,961 --> 00:45:06,561
Out

564
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:07,201
Father

565
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,360
Out
