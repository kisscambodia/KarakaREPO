1
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,760
Why is it so late

2
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,440
Meng Shang Shi

3
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,440
Recipe canon meal

4
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,919
Make an inventory

5
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:03,879
Meng Shang Shi

6
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:04,879
You this

7
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,040
How can you be confused

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,000
Why is it still called Lord Shang Shi

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,520
Let me count it with you

10
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,360
Vegetables delivered today

11
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
It doesn't seem very fresh

12
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,279
The food delivered is not fresh

13
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,039
How did Aunt Meng forget

14
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,360
You used to say it yourself

15
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,919
Fresh vegetables

16
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,039
It takes less than an hour from picking to cooking

17
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,759
Sometimes it comes in a hurry

18
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,759
The dew hasn't dried yet

19
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,479
But you see

20
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,440
Sorry

21
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,880
Excuse me, you are affected

22
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,520
Go back and change to another car and come back

23
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,160
Wen Dian Shan this

24
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,199
Don't cut it

25
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,759
Walk, walk

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,479
Wen Dianshan bullied Aunt Meng again

27
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Don't go

28
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,759
I'll take this

29
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,279
Meng Shang eats such a woman with such a mind

30
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,240
Why do others need sympathy and pity

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,279
Let's work hard

32
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,720
Let me do it

33
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,559
White has a pair of eyes

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
So regardless of honor or inferiority

35
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,119
Let's go

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Moon flower

37
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,279
Next time I meet Meng Shangshi

38
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,959
Don't be so rude

39
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,119
Hu Sishan is now in charge of Shangshi Bureau

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,959
It's only a matter of time before you get promoted to still eat

41
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Why care about unrelated people

42
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:54,839
Miss Yao, you're here

43
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,799
Please wait a moment

44
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:57,720
Yes

45
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,440
I'll wait

46
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,239
Lord Yang

47
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,799
Your Highness is still deliberating

48
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,760
Is there any way for the household department

49
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
I don't know

50
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,640
Where did your highness get the news

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Royal Guards reported it

52
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,760
Royal Guards Vocational College Guard

53
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,320
Local disasters don't seem to be their concern

54
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,320
Listen to everything

55
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,679
If they hadn't interviewed the people's feelings,

56
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:18,040
The household department doesn't know when to hide it

57
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,320
Or Hejian Prefecture deliberately concealed it

58
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,200
This

59
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,839
If you don't wake up,

60
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,399
I kissed

61
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:19,920
Your Highness

62
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,119
Handmaiden Lost Manners

63
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Your Highness, please forgive me

64
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
There are so many places where you lose your sight

65
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
First, I fell asleep halfway through the meal delivery

66
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,799
Second, it is too overstepping

67
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,519
I'm so tired that I hug you myself

68
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,519
Anyway, I don't forgive

69
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:37,920
Bearer

70
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Pull out the staff and blame twenty

71
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,320
Your Highness

72
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,720
Your Highness

73
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,399
Be afraid

74
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,760
See clearly

75
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,399
This is the way the master treats the handmaiden

76
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:14,920
Raise one's head

77
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,920
Handmaiden dare not

78
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,799
Put your head up

79
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,760
I order you to look up immediately

80
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,440
Like

81
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,599
Why did you fall asleep just now

82
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,919
Handmaiden

83
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,960
Tell the truth

84
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,599
In order to prepare for the New Year's Eve banquet,

85
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,919
The handmaiden didn't sleep a wink for four days

86
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,400
This is true of the whole food bureau

87
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,799
So hard

88
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Let's transfer you to the study

89
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,039
No

90
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
Handmaiden daring

91
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Your Highness, please allow the handmaiden

92
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,320
Stay in Shangshi Bureau

93
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,559
Good

94
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,080
Unless you promise me one thing

95
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,400
From now on

96
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,599
Don't talk about your handmaiden and handmaiden

97
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,280
And you told me

98
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Why do you like cooking so much

99
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,520
Your Highness

100
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,039
My mother had high expectations of me when I was young

101
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,359
Always ask the master to teach strictly

102
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
Can't remember the piano score

103
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,760
That's going to be beaten

104
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,400
At that time

105
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,320
The kitchen is the only one for me

106
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,880
Where you can avoid rattan

107
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
Because the place is small

108
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Duoduo porcelain

109
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,119
It is inconvenient to swing the rattan

110
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
During this time in Shangshi Bureau,

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,400
Is the easiest thing in my life

112
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,679
The happiest time

113
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,000
Over there

114
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,039
Get the recognition of others for the first time

115
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,039
I also found the meaning of my own existence

116
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,599
Your Highness

117
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,359
Let this time last a little longer

118
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,400
I thought

119
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,880
Your happiest time is in the study

120
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,119
It seems that I think too much

121
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,200
Your Highness

122
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,119
That's totally different

123
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,640
Your Highness, when dealing with government affairs,

124
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
When leading the troops to fight,

125
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,119
Is it another kind of satisfaction

126
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,239
And carefree

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Good

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
Give me a caress

129
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,599
Yes

130
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,719
You guys wait here

131
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,960
Your Highness clearly refused to allow musicians to enter the study

132
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,559
Who is playing the piano here

133
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,520
This is the piano score written by His Highness himself

134
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,400
Originally only half

135
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,559
The other half

136
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,960
Your Highness said that without the state of mind at that time,

137
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,520
I didn't expect it to be renewed today

138
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Screen drawing

139
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,200
Go and find out who is in the study

140
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,239
I want to see her

141
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,320
Right

142
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,359
Know who is so bold

143
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,320
You can't be lenient

144
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,039
Hu Shang Shi

145
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Hu Shang Shi

146
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,119
Zi Jin

147
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,400
Have you finished sorting out the list of medicinal diets in the past dynasties

148
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,960
Yes

149
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,320
It can be finished tomorrow

150
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,520
What is this doing

151
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,159
On that day, Tai Sun Fei happened to be at the banquet

152
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,719
I tasted the meal made by Zihao

153
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,479
Tell her to make snacks and send them over

154
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,880
To make such delicious food

155
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,159
She must be a woman with a bright mind

156
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,599
Can you play chess

157
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,719
Yao palm meal

158
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,640
I invite you here today

159
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,840
Actually it is

160
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:20,880
Tai Sun Fei

161
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,559
Please

162
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm losing again

163
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,919
Come and play chess with me when you are free in the future

164
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
Xie Tai Sun Fei

165
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,200
Handmaiden leaves first

166
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,599
Screen drawing

167
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,280
You said this Yao girl

168
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
What kind of person is it

169
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,479
This handmaiden can't tell

170
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,440
So kind and kind

171
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm not a man

172
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,440
It will also give birth to closeness

173
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,479
What's more, the emperor and grandson

174
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,039
Tai Sun Fei

175
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,559
Do you really want her to serve your highness

176
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,280
Now someone can make your highness happy

177
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,799
Is to atone for my sins

178
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,320
Read me that poem again

179
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,400
Big Brother

180
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,239
Not that you used to say

181
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,640
You don't have to weigh your words in reading

182
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,479
As long as you understand the great sense of justice

183
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,800
I don't have to take a fame test

184
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,760
The desert is lonely and smoky

185
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Long river falling yen

186
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
Three-year-olds can recite it

187
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,040
Look at you

188
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,319
A few words are wrong

189
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,680
It's solitary smoke, not smoke from kitchen chimneys

190
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,760
It's sunset, not steamed bun

191
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,160
Big Brother

192
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,599
I draw the sunset

193
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,479
You see

194
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,719
There is still glow here

195
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,199
Zhu Zhanyan

196
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,640
You're going to piss me off

197
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,439
Hurry up, hurry up

198
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,560
Come on, come on, keep up

199
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
Emperor

200
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,359
His Royal Highness Emperor Taisun

201
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:10,280
Grandpa Emperor

202
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,400
Today is the Shangyuan Festival

203
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,560
Ministers are waiting for you to visit Long Live Mountain

204
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,439
Why did you come here alone

205
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,319
The emperor is not in Ganqing Palace

206
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Everyone is looking around the Forbidden City

207
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,319
Why only you know where I am

208
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,760
This war horse followed Grandpa Huang for more than ten years

209
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,319
I heard that he is ill today

210
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,439
Presumably, Grandpa Huang will come to visit in person

211
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,439
It's not sick

212
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,319
Is old

213
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,119
Grandpa Emperor

214
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,400
Remember the Dragon Boat Festival banquet that year

215
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,160
You hit the ball and shoot willow

216
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,640
Force the pack

217
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,839
Ministers, foreign emissaries were amazed

218
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,640
I also made a pair

219
00:18:57,199 --> 00:19:00,319
Wanfang Yubo Fengyunhui

220
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,800
Grandchildren still remember that the lower couplet is

221
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
Unify the mountains and rivers, the sun and the moon

222
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,839
What a unified mountain and river, the sun and the moon are bright

223
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,520
There is such heroic spirit at the age of fourteen

224
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,079
Brush next

225
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:42,359
Zhan Ji

226
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,359
After the festival

227
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,839
Get out of the palace and do me a job

228
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,079
Everybody be careful

229
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:00,760
Quickly

230
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,199
Zi Jin

231
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,079
Nine-story archway lights were erected in Ganqing Palace

232
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,239
It's tall and beautiful

233
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,160
Let's go see it

234
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,800
Go quickly

235
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,479
I'm not going

236
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,680
You don't like it

237
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,239
Qiongyuan also has acrobatics and illusion performances

238
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,760
There is also a bow of Qiyun Society

239
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,719
It's lively

240
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,560
The Crown Princess finally gave everyone a day off

241
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,839
Don't you stay here

242
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,000
Ziping, I really won't go

243
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,319
Go, go, go

244
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,359
It's lively

245
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,400
Let's go. Let's go

246
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,319
Let's join in the fun, too

247
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,239
Don't do it yet

248
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,680
Let's do it tomorrow

249
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,199
Don't worry about this first

250
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,119
Let's go let's go

251
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,880
Let's go let's go let's go

252
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,880
There will be more people later

253
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,760
Hurry up, hurry up

254
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,920
Hurry up and join us

255
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Moon flower

256
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Princess Han died unfortunately

257
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,920
Stop blaming yourself

258
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,640
Master

259
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,719
I didn't kill anyone

260
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
I didn't

261
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,520
Master knows

262
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,560
None of this is your fault

263
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,760
I really didn't kill anyone

264
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,160
I didn't kill anyone

265
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,400
Master knows

266
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,560
Master knows that

267
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,520
Give it to me give it to me

268
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,439
This way

269
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,400
Into

270
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,160
Good

271
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,880
Come again and again

272
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,280
Go on, go on, go on

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,640
Attachment prevention point

274
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,400
Over there over there

275
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,400
To

276
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,000
Come and give it to me

277
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,119
One past this way

278
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,040
Good

279
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,040
Attachment prevention point

280
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:25,640
Good

281
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,000
Come again

282
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,319
Come and follow

283
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
How awesome

284
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,640
To continue

285
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,000
None of them are useful

286
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,719
You play with me

287
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,479
Pass it over, pass it over

288
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,719
Purple Azolla

289
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
The Crown Princess had a word first

290
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,439
Regardless of identity on the court

291
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,239
Just on winning or losing

292
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,920
Wu Cairen, she has a charming temper

293
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,520
You go on stage and let her

294
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,920
Remember

295
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,400
I'm calling you. Come here quickly

296
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,640
Go

297
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,599
Go ahead

298
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,520
Give it to me

299
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,359
Watch out for her

300
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:23,719
Give it to me

301
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,160
Miss Yao

302
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,800
Have you seen Empress Zhuang Fei

303
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,959
Empress Zhuang Fei

304
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:36,760
To

305
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,040
She

306
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,000
I looked everywhere

307
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,040
There is no figure

308
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,319
Could you help me find it

309
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,719
Don't say anything

310
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,959
Yes

311
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,880
Then

312
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
This way this way this way

313
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,560
Stop her

314
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,959
Come on

315
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,199
Catch

316
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:15,760
Continue

317
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,079
Come here

318
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,160
Quick, quick, quick

319
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,119
Guard against her

320
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,400
Come again and again

321
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,640
Empress Zhuang Fei

322
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,920
Today's Shangyuan Festival

323
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,359
I

324
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,319
Empress

325
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,920
Kim is looking for you everywhere

326
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,920
Thank you very much

327
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,839
I'm here

328
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,359
Empress Zhuang Fei

329
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,479
Empress

330
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,439
Madam

331
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,760
This way, please

332
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,520
Then let's go and have a look

333
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,400
Watch your step

334
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
What did you do wrong

335
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,760
The one just now

336
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,040
It's Mrs. Peng Chengbo, the mother of the Crown Princess

337
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,760
Being the most strict

338
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,599
If she bumps into her

339
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,319
You sneaked out to join in the fun

340
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,319
You must be severely punished

341
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,599
Lord You

342
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,959
Today, the female official has a day off

343
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,760
Permission to come out to see the celebration

344
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,520
But why is Lord You here

345
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,319
As a royal eagle dog,

346
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,839
What's the errand

347
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,599
It's more important than staying by the emperor's sickbed

348
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,719
Everyone in the palace

349
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,479
Crying Zhuang Fei

350
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,079
And you

351
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,560
A female official covered in secrets

352
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,599
Every word and deed is recorded in the book

353
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,199
So

354
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,920
Don't make mistakes

355
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,680
Your Excellency

356
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,839
Can you and I know each other before

357
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,239
Of course not

358
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,760
What are you doing standing there

359
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,160
Don't go yet

360
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,640
Attachment prevention point

361
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,880
Guard against her

362
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,079
Prevent

363
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,839
Come again and again

364
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,400
Come

365
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,640
Quickly

366
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,079
Here, here, here

367
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,640
Pass it over

368
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:51,839
Here here

369
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,119
Here

370
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,319
Stop her

371
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,800
You sit

372
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,160
Then

373
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,800
Come again and again

374
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,000
This way this way

375
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,479
There are illusion performers in the square over there

376
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,119
Why don't Taisunfei accompany me to have a look

377
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,400
Go ahead

378
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,400
Pay attention to defense

379
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,079
Then I'll have a look, too

380
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,640
Less company

381
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,079
Give it to me

382
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,119
Come here

383
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,920
She is a gentle and kind child

384
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,079
Mother, why do you have to

385
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,599
In the world

386
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,760
Who would be better than the girl I picked myself

387
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,719
You've all met her

388
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,239
Even the emperor himself promised the marriage

389
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,760
Everybody knows

390
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,959
She is the real great grandson

391
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,599
Who knows your majesty listens to the alchemist

392
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,439
Go back on one's word

393
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,680
I changed this woman

394
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,560
Married for so long

395
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,479
Have never given birth to children

396
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,479
Return good fortune

397
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,160
She is an unlucky woman at all

398
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,599
Far less than

399
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,199
Mother

400
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,160
Go

401
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,959
Come and give it to me in the back

402
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:24,920
Come again and again

403
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,319
Go

404
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:27,439
Your Highness

405
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,400
The holy man invites you to watch the lights on the tower

406
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,319
You disappeared in a blink of an eye

407
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,640
Let the Holy One know that it is time to punish you again

408
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:35,719
Your Highness

409
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,439
Today is the Lantern Festival

410
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,599
The ladies-in-waiting all went to see the lights

411
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,680
Miss Yao must not have come

412
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,520
You see

413
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,479
What did I say

414
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,719
Didn't come

415
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:55,560
Your Highness

416
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,880
Your Highness

417
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,359
Don't follow

418
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,760
Good good

419
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,319
You see

420
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,359
How awesome

421
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,479
Good

422
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,760
One more

423
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,439
Good

424
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,280
Your Highness

425
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,199
I think it seems to like you very much

426
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,280
I've brought so many pets

427
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,079
Only treat it closest

428
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,959
Comb and feed it yourself

429
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,359
But it treats me most MoMo

430
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,920
And every day, MoMo

431
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,079
Your Highness loves many pets

432
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,599
Presumably, it is not rare for a raccoon slave to be close

433
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,719
You're not an inkstone

434
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,760
How do you know

435
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,120
In my opinion

436
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,520
It just has no conscience

437
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,439
I just know

438
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:17,959
How do you know

439
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,719
Does Your Highness know

440
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,239
The inkstone is a raccoon slave

441
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,239
My name is Ali, too

442
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,800
I heard that folk children grow up safely

443
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,840
Will have a cheap name

444
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,760
That's an interesting name

445
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,439
Your Highness

446
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,000
I'll go back first

447
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,639
I'm leaving Beijing

448
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,800
Since Daming moved its capital to Beijing

449
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,879
South-to-North Grain Transfer

450
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,080
Reopening Huitong River

451
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,159
Earth dam that can be built

452
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,159
Be destroyed by water every year

453
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,040
Annual repair is overburdened

454
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,320
This time, Grandpa Huang ordered me to inspect the river workers

455
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:01,919
Supervise and repair river course

456
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,239
I don't know when I can return to Beijing

457
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,239
Go with me

458
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,439
Your Highness

459
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,479
I'm here

460
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,000
Waiting for you to return

461
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:32,919
Yao Ziliao

462
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,320
How many secrets are you hiding in your heart

463
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,399
Go play

464
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,080
Go ahead

465
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
I went to play, Your Highness

466
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:17,719
Who is it

467
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:30,719
Purple Azolla

468
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,879
What's the matter

469
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,879
Why are you here

470
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,879
Purple Azolla

471
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,320
Purple Azolla

472
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,040
I let her go everywhere

473
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,520
But she is adamant

474
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:57,919
See I won in the end

475
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,120
Tell someone to stop me in private

476
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,360
Thirty slaps

477
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,399
Anything you say

478
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
Don't make trouble

479
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,159
Don't fight back

480
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:08,159
But these noble people on high

481
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,840
We are not treated as human beings at all

482
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm not reconciled

483
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,719
I'm so unwilling

484
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:25,760
Take it

485
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:28,800
Smash it

486
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,479
What a pity

487
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,360
Your Highness

488
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:15,760
You draw so well here

489
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,679
Why did you tear it up

490
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,879
Not like

491
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:18,919
Not like

492
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,159
How can I

493
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,040
Your Highness

494
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,800
That hand of yours

495
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,919
Miaoshou Danqing

496
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,760
Then what kind of flowers, birds, fish and insects, famous mountains and rivers

497
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,360
What about all the paintings

498
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,719
How could it not be

499
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,959
Business matters

500
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,159
Stay in the Forbidden City if you are in love with your children

501
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,040
Right

502
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,919
Your Highness, the horses and chariots are ready

503
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:37,479
Your Highness

504
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,080
This is the ninth year of Yongle

505
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,959
The new dam built by Song Li when he was ordered to harness the river

506
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,760
This is the position

507
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,439
Since then

508
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,919
Boats come and go on the Jeju River

509
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:46,600
An endless stream

510
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,959
Here is the part that was washed away by the flood

511
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,879
It uses the old transportation road dug in Yuan Dynasty

512
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,120
You see

513
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,120
Your Highness uses tea

514
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,719
Just in time

515
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,879
You can have extra meals tonight

516
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,760
Stay in the Forbidden City if you are in love with your children

517
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,639
Miss Yao

518
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,840
Thank you very much

519
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:35,439
Here

520
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:57,840
Father

521
00:42:58,399 --> 00:42:59,639
Xia Yuanji is right

522
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,879
Compared with the old teacher, there is no work

523
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,679
Army and Horse Savings Ten Lost Eight Nine

524
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,399
He tried to block your northward expedition

525
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,199
It is out of patriotism and sympathy for the people

526
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,719
It's offensive to speak in a hurry

527
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:17,840
I also hope that my father will see that he has been an official for 20 years

528
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,560
The point of loving the people with one heart and one mind

529
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,719
Give him a break

530
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:24,199
He is dedicated to caring for the people

531
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,439
Then I am

532
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,520
A belligerent bad king

533
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,000
Father

534
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:32,840
My son has no such intention

535
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:36,560
This man must be killed

536
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:41,040
Your Highness

537
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,080
Arutai committed a crime against me in Datong Kaiping

538
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:44,479
The holy man insisted on the northern expedition

539
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,919
Xia Daren, the minister of the household department, resisted

540
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,000
Speaking of going out for years,

541
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,080
Insufficient food and pay for troops and horses

542
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:50,479
The holy man flew into a rage

543
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,719
Adult Xia and Cheng Zou Shiyan of Dali Temple

544
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:53,520
They are all in prison

545
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,040
Fang Bin, the minister of the Ministry of War, also committed suicide in fear

546
00:43:58,919 --> 00:43:59,479
Your Highness

547
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,199
The wrath of the holy dragon

548
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,120
You dissuade me

549
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,000
Be careful

550
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:09,719
Grandpa Emperor

551
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,040
The grandson is back

552
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,320
Why did you bring him back again

553
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,479
Tell you

554
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:17,959
Xia Yuanji must die

555
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:18,919
I want to kill him

556
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,679
It's no use persuading anyone

557
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,600
And copy his whole family

558
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,439
I'd like to see it

559
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,600
Keep saying clean and patriotic

560
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,679
Household ministers who love the people like children

561
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:32,199
What is the incorruptible law

562
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,320
Father

563
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,120
Out

564
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:34,760
Father

565
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:36,919
Out
