1
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,639
Don't clip it

2
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,240
How is it

3
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
Hanwang always liked meat

4
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,160
It was my negligence

5
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,399
Your Excellency

6
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,440
We have just received orders, too

7
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,600
Lord Wang

8
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,360
Tonight, even the military forces of the five cities are dispatched

9
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,600
Who the hell are you going to take

10
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,039
Counter-insurgency

11
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,559
Come with me

12
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,959
Don't always look at me

13
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,320
It's hard to eat a piece of meat

14
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
What's the fun of being a man

15
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,679
Father, don't forget your business

16
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,880
Carassius auratus is thick in winter

17
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,760
Taste delicious

18
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,119
This painting was created by Mr. Yun Lin, a painter of the former dynasty

19
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,239
Crucian Carp Belly Soup

20
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Take only two pieces of meat from the belly of the fish

21
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,640
Prepared with Zanthoxylum bungeanum

22
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,720
Extremely fresh and tender

23
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,679
Unique flavor

24
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Fresh and tender lubrication

25
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,760
Melt at the entrance

26
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,799
When I was in my boudoir,

27
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,880
Mother often cooks crucian carp soup with her own hands

28
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,040
What's the matter

29
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:45,519
Recipe canon meal

30
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,519
Recipe canon meal

31
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
Let Purple Azinge Replace Jade

32
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,399
No

33
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,799
Can't

34
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,600
If we lose to the supervisor tonight,

35
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,720
Everyone will be punished

36
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,160
Row

37
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,040
The next dish is Dinghu Shangsu

38
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,359
I know

39
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,359
Needle tip to wheat awn

40
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,760
Bird's Nest to Snow Ear

41
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,399
Just fit

42
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,519
You should accompany her to dress up quickly

43
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,239
Good

44
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,239
Go

45
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,399
Let's go

46
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,359
Let's go. Come on

47
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,079
Hurry up

48
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,959
Your Majesty

49
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,920
This dish is made of snow ears, yellow ears and stone ears

50
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,799
Made of fungus, elm ear, sweet-scented osmanthus ear and six ears

51
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,279
Combined with Nostoc flagelliforme and

52
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,839
Precious ingredients such as fresh lotus seeds are boiled together

53
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,160
It is rare to make it smooth and delicious

54
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
So again

55
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,480
Fresh and elegant

56
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,200
Take away

57
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,959
Don't withdraw yet

58
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:34,799
Yes

59
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,320
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill

60
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,239
It was just an oversight

61
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Sovereign

62
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't wait

63
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,519
When can I see him

64
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,799
You have to wait until after the family dinner

65
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:04,760
Emperor

66
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,200
Ten thousand handprint dishes are coming

67
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,480
It seems to have a refreshing bouquet

68
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,119
Blow on one's face

69
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,799
Your Majesty

70
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,720
This dish uses abalone, shark fin and ginseng

71
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,559
Twenty-eight kinds of ingredients such as Yaozhu deer tendon

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
It is simmered in an aged flower carved wine jar

73
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,960
The vegetables are slightly fragrant with wine

74
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:36,919
Oily but not greasy

75
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,359
Three things about the name of the dish, Fu Shou Quan

76
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,880
Meat fragrance around the tongue

77
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,479
The soup is rich

78
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,080
Endless aftertaste

79
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,119
I have never tasted such delicious food before

80
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,520
Good

81
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,520
Good luck, good luck and longevity

82
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,840
Grandpa Emperor

83
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,320
This is a good sign

84
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,960
Emperor Pu Cha

85
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
It's very delicious

86
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
Is

87
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,400
Grandpa Huang rarely has a big appetite

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,119
Looks like it's the crab soup

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
Crab sauce

90
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,520
Yeah

91
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,599
Crab meat is a very fresh thing in the world

92
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,760
Only the big armour

93
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,880
You can compete with Fu Shouquan in three things

94
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,599
But now is not the best season to eat crabs

95
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,119
Can't bring the delicious soup into full play

96
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,919
I'll use crab cream to mix tofu soup

97
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,520
Put the lightest and most delicious in the world

98
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,719
Combination of two ingredients

99
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,640
Neutralize the freshness of crab flavor with the clarity of tofu

100
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,840
To be just right

101
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Crab sauce still has such an effect

102
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,039
That's no ordinary crab sauce

103
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,919
The fattest hairy crab in the middle and late September

104
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,679
Abandon crab meat

105
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,640
Take only crab cream and crab roe

106
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,880
Elaborate bald butter

107
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,760
Crisp, beautiful and fragrant

108
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,919
The best taste in the world

109
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,000
Which can be compared with ordinary crab sauce

110
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,799
And

111
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,400
That cup of tea

112
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,760
No wonder

113
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,599
Remove fishy smell and greasiness with ordinary tea

114
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,880
You can taste it with your tongue

115
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,039
The fragrance of tofu and the delicacy of crab sauce

116
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,320
Zi Jin

117
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,119
You are really good.

118
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,479
So how many wins and losses do we have now

119
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,479
What was our first game

120
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,479
They won the first game

121
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,119
They won

122
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:54,919
What about the second game

123
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,640
What happened in the second game

124
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,479
I don't know either

125
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,280
Why did you return it intact

126
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,719
Princess Han has asthma

127
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,119
Don't eat chicken all the year round

128
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,640
To avoid offending the princess

129
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,159
So I told someone to withdraw

130
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,359
What are you talking about

131
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,760
You say it again

132
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,840
What's the matter

133
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,200
What's the matter

134
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,919
Princess Han

135
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,239
Xiuzhen

136
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,479
Princess

137
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,359
Princess Xiuzhen

138
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,799
What's going on

139
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,080
Moon flower

140
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,599
What's the matter

141
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,000
You can't eat chicken clear

142
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,479
But my walnut fried kidney flower

143
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,479
Every waist flower

144
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,520
They are all soaked in chicken

145
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,599
Not good

146
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
The princess has a recurrence of a chronic disease

147
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,880
Xuan Tai Yi

148
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,919
Quick Xuan Tai Yi

149
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,880
Yes

150
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,599
Slow down

151
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,520
Sovereign please stay

152
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,119
Mother

153
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,679
The princess has a recurrence of a chronic disease

154
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:37,960
No delay

155
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,239
It is necessary to hurry to make a diagnosis and treatment by Xuan Tai Yi

156
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:40,599
Mother

157
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,440
You take people to your palace first

158
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Please send the medicine manager, too

159
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,840
Handmaiden is going to invite him

160
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,760
Go

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,400
Sovereign

162
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:11,400
Stand down

163
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,200
Father

164
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,159
What does this mean

165
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,039
Bring it up

166
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:30,960
Go

167
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,080
Quickly

168
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,159
Go

169
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,039
Kneel down

170
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,039
Your Majesty

171
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,159
Meng Xian, commander of Changshan Guard

172
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,960
Yulin avant-garde Peng Xu

173
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,960
Qin Tian Jian Guan Wang Shecheng

174
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,719
And the attendant Qing Yang and his son

175
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,960
All the rebels have been won

176
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,239
What crime have you committed

177
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,640
Grandpa Emperor

178
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,359
Wang Shecheng, the official of Qin Tianjian, conspired with Meng Xian

179
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,679
Said he had a different view of the sky recently

180
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,239
There will be a king in the world

181
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,599
And conspired to offer poisoned wine at the banquet

182
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,400
Waiting for an opportunity to poison your majesty

183
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,679
Soldiers rob the arsenal and Fu Bao of Neifu

184
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,440
Then win the six ministers of the five governments of Gonghou Bo

185
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,960
A fake imperial edict has been found

186
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Fu Bao to be stamped

187
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,719
You can abolish the crown prince

188
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,159
Embrace the King of Zhao

189
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,679
Sure enough, he is my good son

190
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm just occasionally infected with minor diseases

191
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,239
Can't look at the direction

192
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,359
Why do you remember

193
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,239
What about this dragon chair and his eldest brother's head

194
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:37,919
Third brother

195
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,479
The third child

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,479
Wake up

197
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,119
Third brother

198
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,799
The third child

199
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,599
Do you really collude with others to poison your father

200
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,960
Conspiracy to usurp the throne

201
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,880
I drink too much

202
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,400
Big Brother

203
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,479
What are you talking about

204
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,559
Say what

205
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,000
What's wrong with this

206
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,119
Why do you want to say this to your heart

207
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,239
My loyalty and filial piety to my father

208
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,000
That's where heaven and earth can show the sun and the moon can learn

209
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
How can I collude with people

210
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
What about plotting evil

211
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,280
Who said that

212
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,559
Is that you

213
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Who instructed you to frame the king

214
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,719
Shut up

215
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,000
Down

216
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,200
Yes

217
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:19,880
Yes

218
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,440
I said third

219
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,200
Chang Shanwei is your guard

220
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,719
Who can afford to transfer but you

221
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,919
Everyone was taken down and refused to recognize it

222
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,520
No

223
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,359
Father

224
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,599
I was greedy just now

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
I fell asleep

226
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,479
I don't know what happened

227
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,479
But someone must have planted it

228
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,000
I want to trap my son in injustice, my father

229
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,839
Let him drink it

230
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:18,880
Emperor

231
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,520
Go

232
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,359
His Royal Highness the King of Zhao

233
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,239
Since I know nothing,

234
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Why don't you dare to drink

235
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,400
Father

236
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,520
There are neither elite soldiers nor strong generals in my son's hand

237
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,000
The army is more selfless and close friends

238
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,199
My son is really alone

239
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,199
Stay in Beijing for several years

240
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:23,359
That's also half a step, I dare not step on the wrong line

241
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,880
That's a partisan in the army

242
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,079
Supported by military commanders

243
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,079
And who is it

244
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,599
The third child hurt me again

245
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,920
My son is wronged

246
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,680
In the early years of war,

247
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,599
My son has a life-long friendship with many military commanders

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,239
But they were all fought in hard battles

249
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,880
Since my son went to the fief,

250
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,719
There will be no contact with these military commanders

251
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:55,880
What's more, I don't know where to talk about the so-called support

252
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,040
To say that it is supported by courtiers

253
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,160
Who can compare with Big Brother in the world

254
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,640
Those sour civil servants in this court

255
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,839
That's not a prince's benevolence

256
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,119
Father and Father

257
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,719
My son wronged his father

258
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,199
All right, don't even say it

259
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:24,839
Father

260
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
This glass of wine today

261
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,319
My son is willing to drink

262
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,719
But before you drink it

263
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,119
My son must swear to heaven

264
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,239
I have no intention of committing insurrection

265
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,319
What happened today must be someone trying to frame up

266
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,880
Someone must be going after the yellowbird

267
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,239
Father

268
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,959
If you must use this glass of wine today

269
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,199
Words from proving innocence

270
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,560
My son is willing to do it

271
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,000
Father

272
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,560
Make one's father impossible

273
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,640
The third brother has always been humble and wise

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,359
Never disobey

275
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,920
This time it must be wronged and wronged

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,760
If this is a glass of poison wine

277
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,560
My son is willing to replace him with his own body

278
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,079
I'll do it

279
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,319
Big Brother

280
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,880
I'll do it

281
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,560
Big Brother

282
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,319
Third brother

283
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,119
Big Brother

284
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,640
Third brother

285
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,239
Big Brother

286
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:15,760
That's enough

287
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,800
Everyone wants to drink poisoned wine to prove innocence

288
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,959
Don't I dare to be alone

289
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,160
And I'm innocent

290
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:21,839
Come and give it to me

291
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:22,959
Give it to me

292
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,239
That's enough

293
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,319
Grandpa Emperor

294
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,280
My grandson hasn't finished his words yet

295
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
Meng Xian Peng Xu

296
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,439
It's just a mere commander

297
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,880
How many soldiers can you have in your hand

298
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,520
To hijack the heavily guarded vault

299
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
It's simply nonsense

300
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,479
Two uncles are extremely clever

301
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,560
How could you do such a foolish thing

302
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,199
Grandchildren have already found out

303
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,719
It's just that those ignorant officials conspired

304
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,000
It has nothing to do with two uncles

305
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,319
Zhanji

306
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
You said so

307
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Third uncle is timid

308
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
You scared my uncle to death

309
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:04,920
Two uncles

310
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,479
You guys reacted too quickly

311
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,199
Before I finish speaking

312
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,640
Even if they are not behind the scenes,

313
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,760
It is also arrogant and indulgent on weekdays

314
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,119
Make a group of ministers greedy

315
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,800
Seek power and usurp the throne

316
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,599
Your Majesty, calm down

317
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,800
Imperial edict

318
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,199
Wang Shecheng is attractive by astronomical phenomena

319
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,920
Zhu

320
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,079
Other people involved, etc.

321
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,599
Xia Zhen Fu Si Prison Yan Shen

322
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,719
Handmaiden's decree

323
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,280
You two

324
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,920
Zhao Wang introspects behind closed doors

325
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:46,920
Yes

326
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,640
And you

327
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,680
Go back to your fief tomorrow

328
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,400
Thank your father

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,280
Han Wang to

330
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:05,880
Sister-in-law

331
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:22,719
Mother

332
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,920
Princess Han suffers from chronic diseases

333
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,680
Why don't you take care of the sick first

334
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,680
Stay in the fief and rest well

335
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,560
The dishes cooked by eight famous chefs in Shangshanjian

336
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,359
How did you know beforehand

337
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,880
And the walnut kidney flower

338
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,520
And who reminded you

339
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,119
Specially cooked with chicken clear

340
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,760
Chicken clear

341
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,839
Princess Han has always had old diseases

342
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,280
Take water wave eggs in the morning to recuperate your body

343
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
Fried kidney flower with walnut kernel in the food list

344
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,280
Cook with chicken clear as usual

345
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,560
It's him

346
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,479
Mother

347
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,520
You believe me

348
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,599
I really didn't do anything

349
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,719
I have never met Princess Han

350
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
I didn't know she had asthma

351
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,520
Mother

352
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
You believe me

353
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,719
Naturally, you don't want to murder Princess Han

354
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,760
You're just trying to set me up

355
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,640
What are you talking about

356
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,040
You clearly know that Princess Han relapsed and died of his old illness

357
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,479
I'm still the palm print of the Food Bureau

358
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,719
Can't escape dereliction of duty

359
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,119
This is not a deliberate framing. What is it

360
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,079
Dereliction of duty

361
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,760
So you're so angry

362
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,719
It's not because Princess Han is dead

363
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,839
I'm afraid of losing your position as a food eater

364
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
What you just said about him

365
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,680
Who on earth is it

366
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,880
Tell me

367
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,439
Say

368
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,520
Who the hell is ordering you

369
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:04,599
No one told me to

370
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I did it myself

371
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,199
I did it all

372
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,719
You are the handprint of Shang Food Bureau

373
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,599
People were killed on New Year's Eve

374
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,079
Naturally, you can't get away with it

375
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,079
I'm deliberate

376
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,319
Just want to see

377
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,079
The way you end up with nothing

378
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,239
Look at you, a woman who abandoned her husband and daughter

379
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,800
What will happen in the end

380
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,800
I did everything

381
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,880
I did it all

382
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,439
You're satisfied

383
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,760
You are so disappointing to me

384
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:33,959
Meng Shang Shi

385
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,880
Crown Princess summoned

386
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,880
Don't be polite

387
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:22,880
Grandpa Emperor

388
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,040
Rebellious minister's palace

389
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,520
It's a child's play to find out the rebellion edict

390
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,319
The third child

391
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,119
Be meticulous at ordinary times

392
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,040
How can you get the wind out in advance

393
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,000
One net into a capture

394
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,680
A Washington

395
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,560
If so

396
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,760
A treasure that arouses people's greed

397
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,319
The thief keeps on going

398
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,000
On the contrary

399
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,520
A ruined temple outside the city

400
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
Except for cobwebs

401
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,520
Have nothing

402
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,199
Even

403
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,239
Rats don't want to patronize either

404
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,400
Imperial dragon chair power

405
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,079
How tempting

406
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
Your two uncles

407
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,880
While I am old and sick,

408
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,880
Collusion with internal officials

409
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,439
Interworking messages

410
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't care, they think

411
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,119
I am deaf and blind

412
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,959
Who told you to scare them

413
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,000
Grandpa Emperor

414
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,839
It is clear that you are scaring them

415
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,400
Bold

416
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,280
Grandchildren never wronged one person

417
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
I have fought more in my life

418
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,719
Decisive war

419
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,119
It is also strictly guarded against parents and children

420
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,800
The world often scolds me for being cruel and violent

421
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
What do you think

422
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:49,959
Say

423
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,560
When grandchildren are young

424
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Grandpa Huang once said

425
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,160
What is a leader

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,640
At first, when people hunted,

427
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,400
Elect the bravest man in the crowd

428
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,160
As a leader

429
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,520
And this man

430
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,359
Is the man who takes the most lives from the beast

431
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
Take up arms and organize an army

432
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,239
Protect tribes and food

433
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
This is the leader

434
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,880
The tribe is still like this

435
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,319
What's more, a country

436
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,680
Ordinary people want to be good people

437
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,119
Doing good deeds and accumulating virtues is

438
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,959
But for emperors,

439
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,079
Adhere to the road of benevolence and righteousness blindly

440
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,280
Will only become a mediocre emperor

441
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,319
What do you think is a good emperor

442
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,079
For the people

443
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,280
For the country

444
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,640
Benevolence and righteousness can be abandoned

445
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
To give up one's own flesh and blood

446
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,680
Even if you are reviled by thousands of people, you have to endure it

447
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
Adhere to the right path of the country

448
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,160
Defend one's territory and people

449
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,119
This is the emperor

450
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:48,040
You always care about your family

451
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,599
Leave room for them

452
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,479
Is that glass of wine poisonous

453
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Even if it is highly toxic,

454
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,160
It only poisons the heart of rebellion

455
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,959
Poison can't defeat the real dragon emperor

456
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,719
Come

457
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
Walk with Grandpa

458
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,160
Crown Princess

459
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,959
What happened at the New Year's Eve banquet

460
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,560
It's all the handmaiden's fault

461
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,760
Handmaiden is willing to be punished

462
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,199
Don't defend yourself

463
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,920
Handmaiden is a humble person

464
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,839
Rely on the protection of the Crown Princess

465
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,680
To have a place to stand today

466
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,959
It should have been a grass-bearing ring to repay your kindness

467
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,079
I made a mistake at the New Year's Eve banquet

468
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,160
Let the villain take the opportunity to make trouble

469
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,479
This is the end of the matter

470
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,520
What face is there to defend before you

471
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,280
Meng Shang Shi

472
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,280
Who do you mean by the villain

473
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,160
People who are familiar with propriety and righteousness in the world

474
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,199
It should be understood that monarch, minister and father and son

475
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,839
The principle of being superior and inferior from top to bottom

476
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,520
I won't make a humble offense and respect the following offenses

477
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:17,640
Slaves are lax in royal affairs

478
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,160
Blindly tolerant and patient

479
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,359
Let the villain push his luck and wait for an opportunity to make trouble

480
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:23,760
One over here

481
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,719
Meng Shang Shi

482
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,319
Hu Si Shan

483
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,000
Handmaiden serves the Lord wholeheartedly

484
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,079
Forget the hidden dangers close at hand

485
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,520
The food list has not been checked again

486
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
Give the villain a chance to form a trap

487
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,439
It was the handmaiden's mistake

488
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,839
This is over two

489
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,479
It's just that handmaiden is deeply gracious

490
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,400
Have to dare to speak out

491
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,880
A man who can betray Shangguan so easily

492
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,079
How can you be trusted

493
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,239
How can you stay around

494
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,000
Imperial Doctor has treated Princess Han

495
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,920
Said she was suffering from chronic diseases

496
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,560
This time, despite dissuasion, I came to Beijing for a long distance

497
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,160
So that the old disease recurs

498
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,119
There is no way to return to heaven

499
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,280
There is nothing wrong with the food list prepared by Guanglu Temple

500
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,959
There is no big mistake for the Food Bureau to make meals according to the order

501
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,920
Besides, Your Majesty appreciates the crab soup very much

502
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,119
The right to make meals still belongs to the Food Bureau

503
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,359
If the food bureau has nothing to do with the death of the princess,

504
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,959
And why

505
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,880
Someone tipped off

506
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,719
You sent a private message to Hanwang

507
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,800
You can plead guilty

508
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,280
This is a false accusation

509
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Hu Si Shan

510
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,920
How dare you say anything in front of your master without evidence

511
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,119
Handmaiden visits Crown Princess

512
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,160
That day in Ganqing Palace

513
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,239
Witnessed Lord Yuan being expelled from the hall

514
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,920
Meng Shangshi once talked about your majesty taking elixir

515
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,079
Dragon's body is unsafe

516
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,640
It is also asserted that there will be changes in the palace

517
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,760
Handmaiden thought afterwards

518
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,479
Fear in one's heart

519
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,880
Don't dare not report it

520
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,479
Meng Shang Shi

521
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,839
If it weren't for the news of having an affair with Hanwang

522
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,599
How can you know that there will be changes in the palace

523
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,280
Pay attention to everything

524
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,839
You can see the micro-knowledge

525
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,359
Crown Princess

526
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,000
Zu Xun has long said clearly

527
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,119
Female officials of empresses and concubines in every palace

528
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,839
Do not interfere in all affairs outside the palace gate

529
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,160
Meng Shang's private glimpse of the Lord is a great sin

530
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,800
Not to mention repeatedly passing messages with the captaincy

531
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,040
Besides, she used to repay the grace of Han Wang

532
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,520
Contrary to your will

533
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,000
Meng Shang Shi

534
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,599
Anyone who writes a post privately has an affair with the outside world

535
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,040
Writers are cut when they receive them

536
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,239
You are still eating in the palace

537
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,719
Knowing to commit a crime

538
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,239
What sin should I commit

539
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,479
If you want to add a crime, you can't say anything

540
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:08,239
Crown Princess

541
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,800
You are wise and wise

542
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,160
I actually believe this provocative statement

543
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,520
Doubt my loyalty

544
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,400
Over the years

545
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
You serve Your Majesty

546
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,959
Preside over the Shang Food Bureau

547
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,800
It's also a dedicated effort

548
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,520
Crown Princess

549
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,400
But you peep at the Lord and talk about palace changes

550
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,400
Words and deeds do exceed the rules

551
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,359
Sin is unforgivable

552
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,839
According to palace rules

553
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,239
Take away the job of still eating

554
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Go to Gongzhengsi to get the crime by yourself

555
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,040
Take care of yourself in the future

556
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
The handmaiden said goodbye

557
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,119
Wanwang Crown Princess Treasures

558
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,280
Congratulations

559
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,199
Meng Shang Shi

560
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,520
Now it's no longer a food

561
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,959
How will I address you in the future

562
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,760
I'm curious

563
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,400
I trust you so much and reuse you

564
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,640
Why did you take refuge in her

565
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,479
Enter the palace from a young age

566
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
We are best friends

567
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,520
Later, he entered the Shang Food Bureau

568
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,920
Because you are overbearing and suspicious

569
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,439
Anyone who doesn't agree with you

570
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,199
Try to suppress expulsion

571
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,640
In order to blind your eyes, we

572
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
I've been pretending to be at odds

573
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,319
Ten years

574
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,719
You've been pretending in front of me for ten years

575
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
It's great

576
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,839
A Wai

577
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,920
Don't be soft-hearted

578
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,360
I know

579
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,959
In addition to acting overbearing, she

580
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,560
Be fair and just

581
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,360
But as long as there is her in one day,

582
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,320
I will never get out of the head

583
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,479
In the past ten years,

584
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
She has always been absolute monarch

585
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,919
We are obviously the best friends

586
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,320
But always pretend to be discord

587
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Don't you have a hard time

588
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,439
In the future

589
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,320
I don't need it anymore

590
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,520
Wake up, wake up, wake up

591
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,080
Everyone is safe and sound

592
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,280
Safe, safe, safe

593
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:04,320
Great, great

594
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:04,959
It's good to be okay

595
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,239
That's great

596
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,399
It's all right at last

597
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,560
It's okay it's okay

598
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,040
I was scared to death just now

599
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,719
What's going on

600
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,320
Do you still have to be held accountable

601
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,399
Come on, come on

602
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:57,560
Come and come

603
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,560
I wish adults good health

604
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,520
Everything means everything

605
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,320
Wish you good luck

606
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,959
Everything goes smoothly

607
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,639
Hurry up, hurry up

608
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,080
Come

609
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,080
Come

610
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Thank you

611
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,199
Thank you, thank you, thank you

612
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,239
Be careful of burning

613
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:32,879
Come

614
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,080
So delicious

615
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,560
Come and come

616
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,679
Get me some vinegar

617
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,679
Zi Jin

618
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,360
The new year is safe and smooth

619
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,479
May you be as lucky as you desire

620
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,320
Reward you

621
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,560
Thank you, Your Highness

622
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,040
All the blessings of the Forbidden City

623
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,679
It's all in this bowl of flat food

624
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,919
I'll eat first

625
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,919
Your Highness has something on his mind

626
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:46,639
Some things

627
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,560
I have a plan in mind

628
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,360
Be comfortable

629
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,719
But there are some things

630
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,439
I haven't tried it either

631
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,479
I don't know what to do with it

632
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:03,520
Your Highness

633
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,800
There is no blessing at all

634
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,439
It's empty

635
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,479
But I followed your highness

636
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,040
Is my greatest blessing

637
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,479
It's you

638
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,280
Why did you set me up

639
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,719
We have no grievances and no enmity

640
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:40,399
How could you

641
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,280
It's a fair deal

642
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,600
You did something for me

643
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,679
And I also got the meal list of the supervisor for you

644
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,199
Do you know that

645
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,600
I became a murderer because of you

646
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,479
It's all your fault

647
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,479
Don't come over

648
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:03,959
Go away

649
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,199
Who hurt you

650
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,800
What's the matter? This is

651
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,399
You mean to be unhappy, don't you

652
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,800
Just like your mother who killed people

653
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,080
My mother didn't kill anyone

654
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,320
Daughter of a criminal woman

655
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,679
How dare you talk back

656
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
You see I won't hit you

657
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,679
You come here

658
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:43,280
See if I don't hit you

659
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,199
See if I don't hit you

660
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,600
My mother didn't kill anyone

661
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,840
Telling you to talk back didn't kill anyone

662
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,760
I told you to talk back

663
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:48,800
You fought back

664
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:51,080
You're right

665
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:56,760
I'm not unaware

666
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,159
But pretend not to know

667
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:00,919
I just want to know

668
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,120
If I stand in danger,

669
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,679
Will anyone notice

670
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,199
I always follow the rules. If I do something wrong,

671
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,040
Is there anyone willing to understand

672
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,679
Even one person is fine

673
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,199
It's just that I didn't think of it

674
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,439
This error

675
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,520
At the cost of human life

676
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,040
It's my choice

677
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,600
Have nothing to do with others

678
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,919
Off you go

679
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,159
You can hate me as much as you like

680
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,120
Only in the future

681
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:01,399
Don't put others

682
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,679
As your hope to live

683
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,840
How did you get out

684
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,840
Walk in

685
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,560
What are you doing

686
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,040
Yuehua hasn't come back yet

687
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,320
You care about her

688
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,159
It's freezing. Get in there

689
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,080
You know everything

690
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:58,280
Except for you

691
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,520
Who has the courage to openly attack the princess

692
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:02,760
It's too presumptuous

693
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:04,000
I told you

694
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:06,800
Never let go of the initiator

695
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:09,320
She regrets this matter to this day

696
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,600
I came to see you this time

697
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,879
You bastard

698
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,399
It seems that you won't go back with me either

699
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,600
Accompanying a gentleman is like accompanying a tiger

700
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,439
But today our emperor

701
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
The most annoying thing is to be smart

702
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,280
You take care of yourself

703
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,760
After I left Beijing,

704
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,879
You don't have to deliver a message

705
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:52,399
Just take care of yourself

706
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,399
My father's teachings have been remembered by my son

707
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,919
There are also official duties

708
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:57,040
One step ahead
