239
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:34,760
Your Highness

240
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:36,120
You're hurt

241
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,600
I'll report it now

242
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,279
Stop

243
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,360
Your Highness

244
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,919
Mother tonight

245
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,039
Has been frightened

246
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,399
Don't worry her any more

247
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,159
Go and find Sheng Yin

248
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,159
Just show me

249
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,520
OK, I'll go now

250
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,159
Your Highness, although it is a skin injury

251
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,159
But the wound is narrow and deep

252
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,720
I will be your highness later

253
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,600
Prescribe a prescription for stopping bleeding and invigorating qi

254
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,559
And

255
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,960
It is estimated that there will be a high fever in the middle of the night

256
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,799
Serve carefully

257
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Never be careless

258
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,799
Father-in-law Yuan has arrived for supper

259
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:39,559
Your Highness

260
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,000
Empress Empress

261
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,039
Asked someone to bring supper

262
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,919
How much would you like to eat

263
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,760
Wait

264
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,919
Your Highness

265
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,799
Your Highness is badly hurt

266
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:49,960
Dietary aspects

267
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,319
Don't neglect carelessness

268
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,520
The head here is

269
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,360
What's the matter

270
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,319
Your Highness

271
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,039
There is a bowl of rice congee in it

272
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,360
There is also a peach cake for enriching blood

273
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:11,720
In addition

274
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,520
There are also two light side dishes

275
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
Peach Crisp Blood-enriching Cake

276
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,360
Warming spleen and stomach and enriching blood

277
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,520
Okay, this is good

278
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,360
Kunning Palace

279
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,679
Do you know your highness is hurt

280
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,199
I forgot to prepare

281
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,840
Ingredients for breakfast tomorrow

282
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,120
You go back first

283
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,240
What's the matter

284
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,520
For whom to prepare

285
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,799
You know it in your own heart

286
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,039
You went back

287
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:05,600
Go back

288
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,000
Come out

289
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,360
Yao canon meal

290
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,960
Hu Shangshi, let me give you a message

291
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,840
I knew you'd come

292
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,919
My support for you

293
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,559
Sincerely everywhere

294
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,240
Coming

295
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,919
You should have come to see me

296
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,520
The skin of this gun dolphin is crisp

297
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,199
The meat is fresh and tender

298
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,480
It is indeed a

299
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,919
A rare delicacy

300
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,840
I thought I had been suffering for many years

301
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,039
I can finally be proud

302
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,799
Unexpectedly

303
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,199
Life

304
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,000
You've already lost

305
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,079
I choose

306
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,439
Pearl Jade White Jade Soup

307
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,279
In fact, it is for

308
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,600
Dispel Your Majesty's prejudice

309
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,760
A real competition

310
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,120
After all, it is necessary to return to

311
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,240
The food itself

312
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,120
You choose this dish

313
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,000
It's nothing more than a peculiar pattern

314
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,919
To please Your Majesty

315
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,760
That and the officials who offer good fortune

316
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,840
What difference does it make

317
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,039
Pigeon soup

318
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:04,919
And

319
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,720
Coconut juice and red dates

320
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,480
Coconut juice instead of dripping water

321
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,360
The soup base is really nourishing and sweet

322
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
Sweet but not greasy

323
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,120
Not bad

324
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,840
The sour taste of this fish soup is

325
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,840
Clear rice soup soaked with glutinous rice in advance

326
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,399
Pour it into a bamboo tube

327
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,799
Heat it over and over again

328
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,679
After natural fermentation

329
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,319
To get sour soup for appetizing and invigorating spleen

330
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,919
So it seems

331
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,480
Nine different soup bases

332
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,360
It must be painstaking

333
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,319
Each has its own merits

334
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,799
Sure

335
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,399
Shine on you is better than blue

336
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,159
It's not wrong for me to lose

337
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,480
Sit down

338
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,919
He Shu told me

339
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,480
Before you left the palace,

340
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,960
Have something to tell me

341
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,439
Do you hate me

342
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,480
You helped me

343
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,399
But it also ruined my right hand

344
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,799
I'm interested in you

345
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,480
Have nothing to say

346
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,319
All this I've done

347
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:50,640
It's all about atonement

348
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,720
When I first entered Hu's house,

349
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,480
It coincides with the birth of the third sister

350
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,720
She was born

351
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,000
It's only over three pounds

352
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,399
Everyone says she won't live long

353
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,960
Even my father and grandmother

354
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
I also think she is a burden

355
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:16,840
I'm always afraid of my sister

356
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
She can't grow up safely

357
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,360
I just made a mess of it

358
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Told a lie

359
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,720
What lies did you tell

360
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,039
I say to everyone

361
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,079
The day the third sister was born

362
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,840
I see red and white gas coming out of the house

363
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,240
It didn't take long

364
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,120
This is in the local area

365
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Passed to Chery

366
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
Third sister was lucky enough to survive

367
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,120
Who would have thought

368
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,399
A child's joke

369
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,799
In the end, it became the Hu clan

370
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,679
A carefully planned beginning

371
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,240
Third sister has been weak since childhood

372
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
Have been rejected a lot

373
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,360
Said the father

374
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,279
I went into the palace

375
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,480
You can avoid a corvee

376
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,199
I was

377
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,159
I already said kiss

378
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,720
But for her sake

379
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,439
I said yes anyway

380
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,279
Sell it, sell it

381
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,319
The daughter of the Hu family

382
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
How is it different from goods

383
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:31,399
Every night I do

384
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,079
It's all carved here

385
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,840
I can't stop for a moment

386
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,960
Do you know why

387
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,439
Because I'm afraid

388
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,919
I'm lonely

389
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,840
I can't even look in the mirror

390
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,079
Because I don't want to see

391
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,480
The face in the mirror

392
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,960
How cold and disgusting it has become

393
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,439
You told me everything

394
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,159
Aren't you afraid I'll tell on it

395
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,399
The first emperor said it was auspicious

396
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:10,319
Is auspicious

397
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,399
Everything you've lost

398
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,399
I can't come back.

399
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,240
All sins are because of me

400
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,840
If you want to blame me, blame me

401
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,559
Hate you, hate me

402
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,960
It has nothing to do with the Crown Princess

403
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,600
If you hate it

404
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:36,720
You kill me

405
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,279
Don't bring her into trouble

406
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,000
The source of this evil

407
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
It's all because of me

408
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,679
You promised

409
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,120
Once you lose

410
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:11,960
Leave the Forbidden City

411
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,679
Never enter the kitchen for life

412
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,679
Take care all the way

413
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,039
Zi Jin

414
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,480
Crown Princess

415
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
My sister sincerely prayed to heaven

416
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,799
May you have peace and joy all your life

417
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,960
This wish is enough

418
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,760
It's late at night

419
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,000
I'll leave first

420
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,120
Why do you want to do this

421
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
You tampered with the seasoning

422
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,840
Why did the design let Hu lose

423
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,319
Once upon a time

424
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,799
I blame you

425
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,079
Hate you

426
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,520
But I can't deny it all the time

427
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,600
My heart

428
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,359
I have been looking forward to the reunion of mother and daughter

429
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,839
But the hearts of the palace are sinister

430
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,040
My existence

431
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,679
It will only become your weakness

432
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,119
You disown me

433
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,119
I don't blame you

434
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,760
But I can't stand it

435
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,159
Others hurt you

436
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,240
So

437
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
This is what I can think of

438
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,720
The only thing I can do for you

439
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,199
Father married his stepmother

440
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,240
Have younger siblings

441
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:12,159
No one cares about me anymore

442
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,080
So

443
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,040
Regardless of all the hardships,

444
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,760
I must come to you, too

445
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,839
Looking for that

446
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,919
The man who gave me life

447
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,000
Go home

448
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,919
Mother

449
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,240
When I first entered the palace

450
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,159
I am reckless and ignorant

451
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,439
It will only become your burden

452
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,839
But it's different now

453
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
I can do anything

454
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,320
I can help you

455
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,320
Can be your arm

456
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,359
I must be better than anyone else

457
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,599
Well done

458
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,280
Mother

459
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,439
Are you sure you can't recognize me

460
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,280
Mother

461
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,359
It's you

462
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,439
Let me ask you something

463
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,839
How did Master die

464
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,800
The book left for me is not finished yet

465
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:00,879
Master is not

466
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:01,960
People who give up halfway

467
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:03,839
She sacrificed herself

468
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,320
It's all about protecting you

469
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,560
And you're trying to cover up the truth

470
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,879
And kill people

471
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,119
Are you still a human being

472
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,399
She knows too much about me

473
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,000
Living is a hidden danger after all

474
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,240
Who can guarantee that

475
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,720
She will never reveal secrets

476
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,800
So you killed her

477
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,359
Right

478
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,199
You know the truth now

479
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:31,520
How is it

480
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:33,919
Do you want to kill me

481
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,000
Avenge her

482
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,919
Do it

483
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,520
Kill me

484
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,599
Thank you very much

485
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:55,919
Give me a ride

486
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:43,080
Crown Princess

487
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,720
Hu Shangshi only ordered the handmaiden

488
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,879
Go and invite Yao Dian to dinner

489
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,839
The rest of the handmaiden really didn't know

490
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Please pardon the Crown Princess

491
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,679
Go down

492
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:55,720
Yes

493
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,919
Stop crying

494
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:09,560
You see

495
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,439
How nice this is

496
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,879
Sister sister

497
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:18,800
Sister Miss

498
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,879
You wait for me, miss

499
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,000
Miss and sister

500
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,439
Wait for my lady to go back

501
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,080
Don't leave me

502
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,159
Go home, miss. Don't leave me

503
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,280
Sister

504
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,040
Sister

505
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,639
Have you all heard about it

506
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,359
Hu Shang Shi

507
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,879
Hu Shangshi committed suicide

508
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,879
Really

509
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,520
Keep your voice down

510
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,240
Guanglu Temple

511
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,720
Miyagi's men are here

512
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,240
This kind of thing is the most taboo in the palace

513
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,199
Don't let it be mentioned

514
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:07,639
What's the matter

515
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,879
Nothing

516
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,439
Kill down bridges

517
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,280
I made a deal with Meng Shangshi

518
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,520
Before my right hand recovers

519
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,599
I'll stay in the still food bureau

520
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,439
Do chores

521
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:48,040
You can also help the little palace maidservants

522
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,599
The concubines of the prince

523
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,159
It's no better than being here

524
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,399
It's strong to get supercilious look at people

525
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:57,399
Give it to me

526
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,359
Don't do it

527
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
You don't want splendor and wealth

528
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,000
Nest here and bask in Chinese cabbage

529
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,359
What for

530
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:09,639
Do you see it

531
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:11,159
My face is green with anger

532
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,879
It's greener than this Chinese cabbage

533
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,560
Su Yuehua wants to cross me

534
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,199
It's not that easy

535
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,679
Zi Jin
