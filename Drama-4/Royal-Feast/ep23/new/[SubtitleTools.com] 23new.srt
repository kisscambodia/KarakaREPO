1
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,800
Your Highness

2
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,160
You're hurt

3
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,640
I'll report it now

4
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,319
Stop

5
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,400
Your Highness

6
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,959
Mother tonight

7
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,079
Has been frightened

8
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,439
Don't worry her any more

9
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,199
Go and find Sheng Yin

10
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,199
Just show me

11
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,560
OK, I'll go now

12
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,199
Your Highness, although it is a skin injury

13
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,199
But the wound is narrow and deep

14
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,760
I will be your highness later

15
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,640
Prescribe a prescription for stopping bleeding and invigorating qi

16
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:05,599
And

17
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,000
It is estimated that there will be a high fever in the middle of the night

18
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,839
Serve carefully

19
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Never be careless

20
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,839
Father-in-law Yuan has arrived for supper

21
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,599
Your Highness

22
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,040
Empress Empress

23
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,079
Asked someone to bring supper

24
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,959
How much would you like to eat

25
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,800
Wait

26
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,959
Your Highness

27
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,839
Your Highness is badly hurt

28
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,000
Dietary aspects

29
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,359
Don't neglect carelessness

30
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,560
The head here is

31
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:50,400
What's the matter

32
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,359
Your Highness

33
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,079
There is a bowl of rice congee in it

34
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,400
There is also a peach cake for enriching blood

35
00:22:58,959 --> 00:22:59,760
In addition

36
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,560
There are also two light side dishes

37
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,800
Peach Crisp Blood-enriching Cake

38
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
Warming spleen and stomach and enriching blood

39
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,560
Okay, this is good

40
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,400
Kunning Palace

41
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,719
Do you know your highness is hurt

42
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,239
I forgot to prepare

43
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,880
Ingredients for breakfast tomorrow

44
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,160
You go back first

45
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,280
What's the matter

46
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,560
For whom to prepare

47
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,839
You know it in your own heart

48
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,079
You went back

49
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,640
Go back

50
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,040
Come out

51
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,400
Yao canon meal

52
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,000
Hu Shangshi, let me give you a message

53
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,880
I knew you'd come

54
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,959
My support for you

55
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,599
Sincerely everywhere

56
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,280
Coming

57
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,959
You should have come to see me

58
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:51,560
The skin of this gun dolphin is crisp

59
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,239
The meat is fresh and tender

60
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,520
It is indeed a

61
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,959
A rare delicacy

62
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,880
I thought I had been suffering for many years

63
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,079
I can finally be proud

64
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,839
Unexpectedly

65
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,239
Life

66
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
You've already lost

67
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,119
I choose

68
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,479
Pearl Jade White Jade Soup

69
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,319
In fact, it is for

70
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,640
Dispel Your Majesty's prejudice

71
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,800
A real competition

72
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,160
After all, it is necessary to return to

73
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,280
The food itself

74
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,160
You choose this dish

75
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,040
It's nothing more than a peculiar pattern

76
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,959
To please Your Majesty

77
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,800
That and the officials who offer good fortune

78
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,880
What difference does it make

79
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,079
Pigeon soup

80
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:52,959
And

81
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,760
Coconut juice and red dates

82
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
Coconut juice instead of dripping water

83
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,400
The soup base is really nourishing and sweet

84
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
Sweet but not greasy

85
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,160
Not bad

86
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,880
The sour taste of this fish soup is

87
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,880
Clear rice soup soaked with glutinous rice in advance

88
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,439
Pour it into a bamboo tube

89
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,839
Heat it over and over again

90
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,719
After natural fermentation

91
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,359
To get sour soup for appetizing and invigorating spleen

92
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,959
So it seems

93
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
Nine different soup bases

94
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
It must be painstaking

95
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,359
Each has its own merits

96
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:55,839
Sure

97
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,439
Shine on you is better than blue

98
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,199
It's not wrong for me to lose

99
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,520
Sit down

100
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,959
He Shu told me

101
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,520
Before you left the palace,

102
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Have something to tell me

103
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:20,479
Do you hate me

104
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:22,520
You helped me

105
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,439
But it also ruined my right hand

106
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,839
I'm interested in you

107
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
Have nothing to say

108
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,359
All this I've done

109
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,680
It's all about atonement

110
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,760
When I first entered Hu's house,

111
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,520
It coincides with the birth of the third sister

112
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,760
She was born

113
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,040
It's only over three pounds

114
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,439
Everyone says she won't live long

115
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,000
Even my father and grandmother

116
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,280
I also think she is a burden

117
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm always afraid of my sister

118
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,280
She can't grow up safely

119
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,400
I just made a mess of it

120
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Told a lie

121
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,760
What lies did you tell

122
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,079
I say to everyone

123
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,119
The day the third sister was born

124
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,880
I see red and white gas coming out of the house

125
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,280
It didn't take long

126
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,160
This is in the local area

127
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Passed to Chery

128
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
Third sister was lucky enough to survive

129
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,160
Who would have thought

130
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,439
A child's joke

131
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,839
In the end, it became the Hu clan

132
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,719
A carefully planned beginning

133
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,280
Third sister has been weak since childhood

134
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,040
Have been rejected a lot

135
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,400
Said the father

136
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,319
I went into the palace

137
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,520
You can avoid a corvee

138
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,239
I was

139
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,199
I already said kiss

140
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,760
But for her sake

141
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,479
I said yes anyway

142
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,319
Sell it, sell it

143
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,359
The daughter of the Hu family

144
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,000
How is it different from goods

145
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,439
Every night I do

146
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,119
It's all carved here

147
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,880
I can't stop for a moment

148
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,000
Do you know why

149
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,479
Because I'm afraid

150
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,959
I'm lonely

151
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,880
I can't even look in the mirror

152
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,119
Because I don't want to see

153
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,520
The face in the mirror

154
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,000
How cold and disgusting it has become

155
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,479
You told me everything

156
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,199
Aren't you afraid I'll tell on it

157
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,439
The first emperor said it was auspicious

158
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,359
Is auspicious

159
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,439
Everything you've lost

160
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,439
I can't come back.

161
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,280
All sins are because of me

162
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,880
If you want to blame me, blame me

163
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,599
Hate you, hate me

164
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,000
It has nothing to do with the Crown Princess

165
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,640
If you hate it

166
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,760
You kill me

167
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,319
Don't bring her into trouble

168
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,040
The source of this evil

169
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,000
It's all because of me

170
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,719
You promised

171
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,160
Once you lose

172
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,000
Leave the Forbidden City

173
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,719
Never enter the kitchen for life

174
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,719
Take care all the way

175
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,079
Zi Jin

176
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,520
Crown Princess

177
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
My sister sincerely prayed to heaven

178
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,839
May you have peace and joy all your life

179
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,000
This wish is enough

180
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,800
It's late at night

181
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,040
I'll leave first

182
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,160
Why do you want to do this

183
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
You tampered with the seasoning

184
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,880
Why did the design let Hu lose

185
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,359
Once upon a time

186
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,839
I blame you

187
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,119
Hate you

188
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,560
But I can't deny it all the time

189
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,640
My heart

190
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,399
I have been looking forward to the reunion of mother and daughter

191
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,879
But the hearts of the palace are sinister

192
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,080
My existence

193
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,719
It will only become your weakness

194
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,159
You disown me

195
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,159
I don't blame you

196
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,800
But I can't stand it

197
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,199
Others hurt you

198
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
So

199
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
This is what I can think of

200
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,760
The only thing I can do for you

201
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,239
Father married his stepmother

202
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,280
Have younger siblings

203
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,199
No one cares about me anymore

204
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,120
So

205
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,080
Regardless of all the hardships,

206
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,800
I must come to you, too

207
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,879
Looking for that

208
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,959
The man who gave me life

209
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,040
Go home

210
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,959
Mother

211
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,280
When I first entered the palace

212
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,199
I am reckless and ignorant

213
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,479
It will only become your burden

214
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,879
But it's different now

215
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
I can do anything

216
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,360
I can help you

217
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,360
Can be your arm

218
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,399
I must be better than anyone else

219
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,639
Well done

220
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,320
Mother

221
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,479
Are you sure you can't recognize me

222
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,320
Mother

223
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,399
It's you

224
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,479
Let me ask you something

225
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,879
How did Master die

226
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,840
The book left for me is not finished yet

227
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:48,919
Master is not

228
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,000
People who give up halfway

229
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:51,879
She sacrificed herself

230
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,360
It's all about protecting you

231
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,600
And you're trying to cover up the truth

232
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,919
And kill people

233
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,159
Are you still a human being

234
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,439
She knows too much about me

235
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
Living is a hidden danger after all

236
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,280
Who can guarantee that

237
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,760
She will never reveal secrets

238
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
So you killed her

239
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,399
Right

240
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,239
You know the truth now

241
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,560
How is it

242
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:21,959
Do you want to kill me

243
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,040
Avenge her

244
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,959
Do it

245
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,560
Kill me

246
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,639
Thank you very much

247
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:43,959
Give me a ride

248
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,120
Crown Princess

249
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,760
Hu Shangshi only ordered the handmaiden

250
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,919
Go and invite Yao Dian to dinner

251
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,879
The rest of the handmaiden really didn't know

252
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Please pardon the Crown Princess

253
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,719
Go down

254
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:43,760
Yes

255
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,959
Stop crying

256
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,600
You see

257
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,479
How nice this is

258
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,919
Sister sister

259
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:06,840
Sister Miss

260
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,919
You wait for me, miss

261
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,040
Miss and sister

262
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,479
Wait for my lady to go back

263
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,120
Don't leave me

264
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,199
Go home, miss. Don't leave me

265
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
Sister

266
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,080
Sister

267
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,679
Have you all heard about it

268
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,399
Hu Shang Shi

269
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,919
Hu Shangshi committed suicide

270
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,919
Really

271
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,560
Keep your voice down

272
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,280
Guanglu Temple

273
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,760
Miyagi's men are here

274
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,280
This kind of thing is the most taboo in the palace

275
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,239
Don't let it be mentioned

276
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,679
What's the matter

277
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,919
Nothing

278
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,479
Kill down bridges

279
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,320
I made a deal with Meng Shangshi

280
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,560
Before my right hand recovers

281
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,639
I'll stay in the still food bureau

282
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,479
Do chores

283
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,080
You can also help the little palace maidservants

284
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,639
The concubines of the prince

285
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,199
It's no better than being here

286
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,439
It's strong to get supercilious look at people

287
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:45,439
Give it to me

288
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,399
Don't do it

289
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,320
You don't want splendor and wealth

290
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,040
Nest here and bask in Chinese cabbage

291
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,399
What for

292
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:57,679
Do you see it

293
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,199
My face is green with anger

294
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,919
It's greener than this Chinese cabbage

295
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,600
Su Yuehua wants to cross me

296
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,239
It's not that easy

297
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,719
Zi Jin
