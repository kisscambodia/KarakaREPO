00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,440
Yongle twenty-two years in August

2
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,599
Ming prince Zhu Gaochi ascended the throne as emperor

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,199
Crown Princess Zhang as Empress

4
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,360
And canonized Guo as a noble concubine

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,639
The crown prince Zhu Zhanji was named the crown prince

6
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,160
Hu's Crown Princess

7
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,800

8
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,919
The princess sent someone from the palace

9
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,279
Crying for days before

10
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
The princess is weak

11
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,479
Coughing

12
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
Hu Shang's index finger asked you to make a medicated meal and send it to you

13
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,679
Yes

14
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,199
The civil and military officials went to the table five times to persuade them to enter

15
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,720
His Majesty has promised to ascend the throne

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,839
according to etiquette

17
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,279
Twenty-seven days have passed since mourning

18
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,600
officials who are in a hurry

19
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,759
But the abacus is wrong

20
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,320
Is the father and son concentric

21
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,080
So is the prince

22
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,160
I heard you have a bad cough yesterday

23
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
don't hold on

24
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,839
Or ask the pharmacist to come and have a look.

25
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,320
I was too tired a few days ago

26
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,679
stasis heat inside

27
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,559
It was cold again last night

28
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,399
Just rest for a few days

29
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,760
no fuss

30
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,079
it's your body that matters

31
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,279
Slave, this will help you make a cup

32
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,880
Ganfengling developed by Taiyuan Hospital

33
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,200
you drink first

34
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay

35
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,320
It's good to use it for the past few days

36
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,000
You are the most considerate

37
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,519
it's hot

38
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,559
I'm feeling chest tightness and thirst

39
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,160
The princess has been coughing for a long time

40
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,239
lotus leaf porridge to clear heat and moisten the lungs

41
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,720
please give it a try

42
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,239
Inside is sweet-scented osmanthus and taro paste

43
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes

44
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,880
Cinnamon refreshing fragrance

45
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,399
Taro nourishes the stomach and strengthens the spleen

46
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,000
But the princess is weak and spleen

47
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,600
Taro is easy to bloat

48
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,399
can not be used more

49
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,359
I use this lotus leaf porridge very well

50
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,160
Today's meal is light and delicious

51
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,399
Give it to the Crown Prince as it is.

52
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,040
Yes

53
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:11,959
princess

54
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,640
Beware of wolves

55
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,320
Free from Yongle's 22-year household registration salt and grain

56
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,000
Everywhere it owes horse grass and charcoal

57
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,399
Before December of the 20th year of Yongle

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,679
Do your best to avoid

59
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,640
add one more

60
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,640
flee to every house

61
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,359
all guilty

62
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,480
Return to home country to resume business

63
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,839
two-year exemption

64
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,399
Taxes owed by the household

65
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
Do your best to avoid

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,519
father emperor

67
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,239
I just go to buy everywhere

68
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,640
did you come for this

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,880
The father emperor stopped the horses in the west city and Yunnan

70
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,359
Cochin acquisition

71
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,600
It's all acts of compassion

72
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,000
Sonny has no objection

73
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,559
Only the issue of Nanjing

74
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,440
Also ask the father to think twice

75
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,160
Who said it's all over

76
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,279
Who said it's all over

77
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,160
You know before I say it

78
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,399
Are you sending someone now too?

79
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,359
Watch my every move

80
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,559
Father's anger

81
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,320
The son just heard that the emperor ordered people to go south

82
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,000
I dare to speculate on the renovation of the Imperial City of Nanjing

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
After the grandfather's mourning period

84
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,839
The emperor may have intentions to return

85
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,119
Ruo Erchen guessed wrong

86
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,559
Please forgive my father

87
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,959
Since moving the capital

88
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,720
south-to-north diversion

89
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,760
Labor and wealth

90
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,799
Arutai keeps nuisance

91
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,440
Nanjing

92
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,200
It is the capital of the Taizu

93
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,720
still Nanjing

94
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,239
That is to follow the old system of the ancestors

95
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,040
father emperor

96
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,079
Beijing is the Land of Longxing

97
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:18,600
dangerous location

98
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,679
The grandfather moved the capital here

99
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,040
It is to honor the Son of Heaven

100
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,640
Guarding the gate of Daming

101
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,880
Control the four levels, level the world, and achieve the foundation of all ages

102
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,200
In a hurry, it is easy to return

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Grandpa Huang's painstaking efforts will be destroyed in one fell swoop

104
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,880
father emperor

105
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,039
The person the grandfather wants to kill

106
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,919
Regardless of the severity of the crime

107
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,440
you are always pardoned

108
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,200
his national policy

109
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
It's changing one by one

110
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,280
Going backwards everywhere

111
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,760
why exactly

112
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Prince

113
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,039
Don't rely on the emperor's favor for you

114
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,919
You can be so presumptuous to me

115
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,359
grandfather loves me

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,719
Only because there are people in this world who can understand him

117
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,640
only me

118
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,119
Grandfather's aspirations, father doesn't understand

119
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,039
never understand

120
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
You just want to be a benevolent king

121
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,960
But now the country's biggest troubles remain

122
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,679
rely only on benevolence

123
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,239
Can't rule the world

124
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,159
then you tell me

125
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,440
What is the trouble

126
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,599
Han-o

127
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,000
what i did

128
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,840
you don't need to beak

129
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,559
get me out

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
get out

131
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,840
Erchen resigns

132
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,440
continue

133
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes

134
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,239
At that time, Jinyiwei was ordered by the emperor to test

135
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Oversee the East Palace

136
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,520
where is the volume

137
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,440
Waiting for the grandfather to win

138
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,280
Let's go hunting

139
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,039
adult

140
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,159
I have been instructed to monitor the East Palace

141
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Now the new emperor succeeds

142
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,200
Will it settle accounts after the fall?

143
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,320
kneel down

144
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,799
Hu Shangshi

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,880
what does this mean

146
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,159
princess

147
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,640
The slaves came here today to plead guilty

148
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
Slaves are not strict

149
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,919
Let Yao Zijin commit the big crime of privately indulging Concubine Zhuang

150
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,280
Private Zhuang Concubine

151
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
Before Concubine Zhuang was buried

152
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,440
Yao Zijin took advantage of the meal delivery machine

153
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,760
Concubine Zhuang leaves the palace privately

154
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,559
This is evidenced by Ajin, the maid of Yongning Palace.

155
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,200
Now the harem has been decided

156
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,919
The queen is busy

157
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
Slaves dare not disturb

158
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,039
Came here specially to ask the princess to decide

159
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,320
Hu Shangshi

160
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,359
Do you know how sinful a false accusation is

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
Even if you are my elder sister

162
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,159
I won't be indulgent

163
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,159
Akin

164
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,880
How dare you hide it in front of the princess

165
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,280
Are you dying?

166
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,840
princess

167
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,679
It was Miss Yao who gave her master a jade pendant

168
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,359
Just walked out of Bei'anmen safely

169
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,159
what jade pendant

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,119
A phoenix pendant that only a queen can have

171
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,320
The Bei'anmen guard is an old man in the palace

172
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,679
Once you see this

173
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,640
Fright is not enough

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,919
How dare you stop

175
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,200
General Chen promises to be tight-lipped

176
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,760
When returning to the palace

177
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,919
But it needs to be left as proof

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,039
Yao Zijin

179
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,679
where did you get this

180
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,640
It is said that this phoenix pendant was carved by the emperor himself.

181
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,200
Empress Renxiao carries it with her day and night

182
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,359
Seeing Pei in the palace is like seeing the Lord

183
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,679
Obey the order

184
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,840
Empress Renxiao raised the prince herself

185
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,200
Grandparents are very affectionate

186
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,559
after she passed away

187
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,159
Leave the jade pendant to the late emperor

188
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,440
Indicates that he will leave it to his future granddaughter-in-law

189
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
You say

190
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,039
This jade pendant

191
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,679
Why in the hands of a female official

192
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,280
Yao Zijin

193
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,679
who are you

194
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,679
Your Highness

195
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:18,840
call her

196
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,919
Your Highness

197
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,719
i want to see her

198
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,400
Yes

199
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,239
what's the matter

200
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,000
Your Highness

201
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,719
General Chen Lao, the defender of Bei'an Gate

202
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,400
Knowing that His Royal Highness is waiting for the Zigong day and night

203
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,479
never dared to disturb

204
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,599
I heard that His Highness is back

205
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,799
have something to offer

206
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
why don't you answer

207
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,599
Yao Zijin

208
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,599
She was the emperor

209
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,320
Concubine appointed for the prince

210
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,159
Mrs. Peng Chengbo

211
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,200
princess

212
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,840
Sun's Fang is ten years old

213
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
He was introduced to the palace by Mrs. Peng Chengbo

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,479
Raised by the current Queen Zhang

215
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,119
half a year later

216
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,599
Sun's illness leaves the palace

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,280
Stay in Yongcheng to recuperate

218
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,919
You can only get married when you grow up

219
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,840
Who knew that the first emperor obeyed the mandate of heaven

220
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,880
Change you to be the concubine

221
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,679
Sun is narrow-minded

222
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,599
a serious illness

223
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,239
After the emperor found out

224
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,239
displeased

225
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,520
No one has dared to mention her since then.

226
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,840
princess

227
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,359
I said before that you are kind and kind

228
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,880
See it now

229
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,799
You've been blinded by this viper woman

230
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,599
She concealed her identity and entered the palace

231
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,960
lurking around you

232
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,760
what is the purpose

233
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,880
Self-explanatory

234
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,559
Hu Shangshi

235
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,799
You and I have been together for a long time

236
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,280
Have I ever done a bad thing

237
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,039
Did you kill someone?

238
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,440
dare you say

239
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,640
You concealed your identity and entered the palace

240
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,559
not something else

241
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,760
princess

242
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,000
This woman is left behind

243
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,200
can not tolerate

244
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,280
I know you can't be ruthless

245
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,119
I'll do it for you

246
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,320
come
Free at kisskh.me


247
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,559
you really want to kill me

248
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:56,880
Hu Shangshi

249
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,080
Hu Shangshi

250
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,880
Yao Zijin

251
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
Intention to murder the princess

252
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,040
Unacceptable Gong Zhengji interrogation

253
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,880
have committed suicide

254
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,199
princess

255
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,680
Evidence is here

256
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,880
princess

257
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,800
previously

258
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,079
you want to take my identity

259
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
Now I'm still making up lies

260
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,479
take my life

261
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,199
I always thought you were kind

262
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,640
But when it involves oneself

263
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,199
you're about to turn things around

264
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you reckless?

265
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,439
not possible

266
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,680
elder sister

267
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:01,880
not possible

268
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,520
she must die, the princess

269
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,640
must kill her

270
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:07,920
elder sister

271
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:09,800
elder sister

272
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,199
elder sister

273
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,599
After entering the palace

274
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,040
i lost a sister

275
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,079
when i see you

276
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,719
The feeling of being lost and found

277
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,040
just before yesterday

278
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,800
i'm still thinking

279
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,239
you are so smart

280
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,160
never fail

281
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,959
future

282
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,280
I should leave the mantle to you

283
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,359
But

284
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,959
You threatened the Hu family

285
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,199
threatened the princess

286
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,280
I have no choice

287
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,880
In the next life I will be a cow and a horse

288
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,439
Pay for my sins today

289
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:14,920
elder sister

290
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,439
you are confused

291
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,359
Crown Princess, all women in the world can enter the palace

292
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,400
Only Sun can't

293
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,959
I do it all for you

294
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,599
even if you are not for yourself

295
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,599
Consider your loved ones too

296
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,479
what are you doing

297
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,199
Zijin Lai

298
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,680
are you alright

299
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Zijin

300
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:52,920
Your Highness

301
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,719
take people away

302
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,119
Your Highness

303
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,319
Zijin

304
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,000
If I hadn't sent someone to watch the Qingning Palace

305
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,800
Are you going to lie to me for the rest of your life?

306
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,079
Your Highness, please rest assured

307
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Miss Yao is just too frightened

308
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
body is fine

309
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,760
wake up soon

310
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,079
go down

311
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,119
Yes

312
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,479
resign

313
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
no explanation

314
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
this is going

315
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,719
Yao Zijin

316
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,920
Do not

317
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,520
I forgot your surname is Yao

318
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,199
Is it even a fake name?

319
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,640
Your Highness is really a nobleman and forgets things

320
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,680
when i see you

321
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
you're only ten

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,439
Yes

323
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:39,880
Entering the palace for the first time

324
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,479
still young

325
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,439
how many years have passed

326
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,160
don't say your majesty

327
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,479
Who else in this palace remembers who I am?

328
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,400
It was your grandmother who entered the palace for you.

329
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,560
is not it

330
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,599
Does His Highness want to prosecute the slave and maid for the crime of impersonation?

331
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,640
I said

332
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,599
You are not allowed to call yourself a slave

333
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,199
I'm not a slave now

334
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
who is that

335
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,439
you immigrated to the palace

336
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
approach me on purpose

337
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,319
what do you want to do

338
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:10,959
Your Highness

339
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,119
that year

340
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,880
I went to worship Buddha with my mother

341
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,880
I accidentally met Mrs. Peng Chengbo

342
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,920
From then onwards

343
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,400
Madam often goes in and out of Sun's house

344
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,239
And my mother taught me

345
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,439
more and more severe

346
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,800
I found out later

347
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,439
In order to consolidate the power of the Zhang family, Mrs.

348
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,880
The girl who has been looking for early wisdom

349
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,280
Teach carefully

350
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,599
In preparation for the choice of the concubine

351
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,719
finally

352
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,199
she picked me

353
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,520
Your Highness doesn't like playing chess with me very much.

354
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
listen to me play the piano

355
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,680
In addition to piano, chess, calligraphy and painting

356
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,479
Pipa Orchestra

357
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,319
female red cooking

358
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,959
Even Cuju, riding and shooting are not a problem.

359
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,199
what does your majesty like

360
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,160
I will learn to master

361
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,719
not so

362
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,839
i will be beaten

363
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Serve Your Highness

364
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,000
live for you

365
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,760
Seems like the only meaning in my life

366
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,160
I don't know any of this

367
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,119
Yes

368
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,359
such a small thing

369
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,920
How to tarnish the ear of His Highness

370
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,359
Your Highness will not know

371
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,839
Before I entered the palace to see the emperor

372
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,439
What happened to the Sun family?

373
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,560
Since it is the master who taught you from childhood

374
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,599
You have become the first choice of Taisun Concubine

375
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,479
it was a good thing

376
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,000
why is she

377
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,800
she is not my teacher

378
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,280
she is my biological mother

379
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,079
i pee know

380
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,680
she is my mother

381
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,119
But I never called her once

382
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,000
Because of her humble status

383
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,719
Because she will defile the lintel of the Sun family

384
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,119
So we get along day and night

385
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,680
her hands

386
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,800
teach me to read and write

387
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,239
play the piano

388
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,199
But don't let me call her mother

389
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,000
How many times do I have to blurt out

390
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,520
In the end I dare not

391
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,439
she died

392
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
die for me

393
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,439
A person who is a grandson

394
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,959
how to let others know

395
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,479
her mother was born

396
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,760
how proud she is

397
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,520
she never gave up

398
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,760
But she recognized

399
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,199
for my future

400
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,079
In order for me to have a background that is not criticized

401
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
She hangs herself

402
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,359
Your Highness

403
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,239
for you

404
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
It's just a change of choice

405
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,199
for me

406
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,199
Means my biological mother sacrificed in vain

407
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,920
Means her death is meaningless

408
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:05,959
I do not want

409
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,959
I don't want to be a grandson

410
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,119
I just hope she survives

411
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,439
I'm wrong

412
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,800
The one thing I regret the most

413
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,839
while she was alive

414
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,920
I didn't call her motherfucker

415
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,599
I am sorry

416
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,439
Zijin

417
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,640
Your Highness didn't ask me

418
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
Why enter the palace

419
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,560
Although Xu is not my biological mother

420
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,359
But she pity my mother

421
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,319
treat me like my own

422
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,640
she is seriously ill

423
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,040
still holding a breath

424
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,839
Want to see me marry beautifully

425
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,199
But in the end

426
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,640
Finally got the news

427
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,800
Your Highness

428
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,680
just because of this marriage

429
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,119
I lost the most important person in the world

430
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,520
So I have to enter the palace

431
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,400
I have to see for myself

432
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,239
How good is the woman who replaced me

433
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,719
I would like to ask your Highness in person

434
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,199
where am i going wrong

435
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,719
you're not wrong

436
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,839
it's not your fault

437
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:41,839
I promise

438
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
from now on

439
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
No one will dare to hurt you again

440
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,479
I promise

441
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,359
princess

442
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,800
His Royal Highness he

443
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,839
Please don't worry, princess

444
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
His Highness was going to punish Hu Shangshi severely.

445
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
But Miss Yao said

446
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,680
Acquaintance after all

447
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,079
beg your highness for mercy

448
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,359
His Highness has ordered Hu Shangshi to go back and meditate on his past.

449
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,280
But if you repeat

450
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,119
next time

451
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,560
princess

452
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,640
His Highness ordered the servants to take you back to the palace

453
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,079
go out and guard

454
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,239
Yes

455
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,920
The elder sister is careless

456
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,640
Annoyed His Highness

457
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
now you are satisfied

458
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,560
I've never nurtured someone so carefully

459
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,280
Kill her now

460
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,680
for whom

461
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,839
you still don't know how to repent

462
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:34,160
Even if she really had a marriage contract with His Royal Highness

463
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,439
But now times have changed

464
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,680
Am I so narrow-minded

465
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,920
There are many beauties in the harem

466
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,599
Can't you leave her alone?

467
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,640
why are you laughing

468
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,760
i'm asking you

469
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,800
why not answer

470
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Emperor Taizu to avoid interference in the harem

471
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,560
foreign relatives

472
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,800
ancestral teachings

473
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,160
After Prince Fan

474
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,000
concubines

475
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,319
A woman from a good family in the electorate

476
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,599
These women who were elected to the palace

477
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,839
no family reliance

478
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,400
the only one you can rely on

479
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,479
love with the king

480
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,719
Emperor Taizu's Empress Xiaocima

481
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
The late emperor benevolence and filial piety

482
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,400
All of them accompanied their husbands to go to war

483
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,599
made an indelible contribution

484
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
in the heart of the king

485
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,079
Even if the world is stunning

486
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,560
Not as good as marrying a wife

487
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,959
Emotions

488
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,640
princess

489
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,560
Now I ask you something

490
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,959
How is your relationship with the prince?

491
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,160
Surrounded by beauty around the prince

492
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
but never despised my wife

493
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,239
he's not like that

494
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,719
wife

495
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,119
do not forget

496
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,439
you are in grief

497
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,640
Almost accidentally hurt the prince

498
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,400
What kind of relationship is there between husband and wife?

499
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,119
think about it

500
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,160
Know Sun's misfortune and sacrifice

501
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,520
The prince will surely give birth to infinite guilt and pity

502
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,319
The only thing you should be thankful for is that you took the lead

503
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,239
early name

504
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,079
Otherwise, the Sun will appear

505
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,040
Where is your place to stand?

506
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
stop talking

507
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Changes in this harem

508
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Even if there is merit, it may not be safe

509
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,400
Queen Zhang now

510
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,959
Accompanying husband all the way

511
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,280
From the Prince of Yan to the Emperor

512
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,560
Saved him many times in distress

513
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,680
But now in this harem

514
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
One more Guo

515
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,920
Founding Heroes

516
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,439
Young and beautiful and won the Sacred Heart

517
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,119
also gave birth to three princes

518
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,959
When His Majesty ascends the throne, he is promoted to the imperial concubine

519
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,400
What kind of person is Queen Zhang

520
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,079
No, it’s not about forbearance and concessions everywhere.

521
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,520
How are you better than Queen Zhang?

522
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,239
The princess should wake up

523
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,599
You were ordered to monitor the East Palace

524
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,000
But only record my daily good deeds

525
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:19,160
Aren't you afraid that the emperor will blame you?

526
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,599
apprehensive

527
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,479
When His Majesty was in the East Palace

528
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,119
good people say

529
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,719
Your Royal Highness is slanderous

530
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:27,920
Your Majesty Cloud

531
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,040
I don't know

532
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,880
Know as child

533
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,880
Knowing that there are always people behind the scenes slandering the late emperor

534
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,520
Divorce the royal family's father and son

535
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,560
Your Majesty is gracious

536
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,880
Only read the duty of filial piety for the son of man

537
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,160
minister

538
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,239
Naturally, only do the duty of a courtier

539
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,280
then you are

540
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,760
Is it allegiance to the emperor?

541
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,560
still loyal to me

542
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,640
His Majesty

543
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,280
Emperor Xiandi's Five Northern Expeditions

544
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,680
Entrust the country as much as possible

545
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,160
You sympathize with the Kuan Ren Yu of the Republic of China

546
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,880
Who does not admire the civil and military affairs of the Manchu Dynasty

547
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,000
How can the minister allow the villain to be framed

548
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,199
to the collapse of the country

549
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,880
As a Jinyiwei

550
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
perform the duty of supervision

551
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,760
recorded and heard

552
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,920
all heard

553
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,479
If a word is not true

554
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,839
willing to be punished

555
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Almost wronged the loyal minister

556
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,359
get up

557
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:26,560
Yes

558
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,400
Wang Jie resigned due to illness

559
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
I order you

560
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,160
The commander of the collared guard

561
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,040
Don't betray my trust in you

562
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,079
subject to orders

563
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,920
Chen Ding's liver and brain paint the ground

564
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,280
live up to grace

565
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:53,959
His Majesty

566
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,520
time to eat

567
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:56,920
go

568
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,719
Yes

569
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Miss Yao refuses to accept it

570
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,879
she says

571
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,959
This phoenix doesn't belong to her at all

572
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,159
from now on

573
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,399
East Palace meal

574
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,360
It's up to you

575
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,800
Hu Shangshi

576
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,919

Siyi begged me for a long time

580
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,399
I just promised to let you go

581
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,360

Yes

Little things

586
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
Why tune in the past

587
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,120
Who is going to transfer to Siji?

588
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,520
Holy oracle

589
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,040
from now on

590
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,479

heavy responsibility

599
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,520
Since the time of Emperor Taizu

600
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,600
Convenience and food for two

601
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,600
now

602
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
It's just following the old example

603
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,080
what's wrong

604
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,719

I admire Yao Zijin's cooking skills

608
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,239
I want to keep her in the restaurant

609
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,399

All staff are under your control

613
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,159
All right

614
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,560
You are all busy

615
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,760
Yes

616
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,879
Great

Zijin

618
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,719
There is Meng Shangshi in charge

619
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,159
We will be more at ease

620
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:16,800
I adult

621
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,159
you were

622
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,159
promised me

623
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,600
let me run the food bureau

624
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Mengshi domineering

625
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,120
Su Ri doesn't even care about me

626
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,320
how can i help her

627
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,360
This time the holy edict

628
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,439
I'm just doing my job

629
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,040
The person who even the empress hates

630
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,479
how to meet your majesty

631
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,520
Is it Concubine Guo

632
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,760
This officer doesn't know

633
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,879
I adult

634
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,399
you want to stay out

635
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:47,679
I'm afraid it's not that easy

636
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,840
Since I took charge of the Food Bureau

637
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,439
Lots of current accounts

638
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,800
If Meng clan regained power

639
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,439
Once checked

640
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,479
Inevitably adults will also be involved

641
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,959
you threaten me

642
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,479
dare not

643
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,800
Do it yourself

644
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,800
I already told you

645
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,959
Jingquan is insatiable

646
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,840
You shouldn't get too close to him

647
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,199
At first, I was just in charge of the food bureau.

648
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,080
If you don't give him some benefits

649
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,320
how can

650
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,679
Promoted to Shangshi so quickly

651
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,439
meals to enter the population

652
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,320
Not to be missed

653
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,439
as a cook

654
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
for selfishness

655
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
indulge others

656
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,159
What qualifications do you have to make meals?

657
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,080
A Wai

658
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,560
you weren't like this

659
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,520
I remember you said

660
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,080
contestable

661
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,320
but you will not forget

662
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
The bottom line of being a man

663
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,919
the you now

664
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,479
remember you before

665
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:54,520
did you say

666
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,159
bottom line

667
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
One only needs to take the first step

668
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,399
cross the line

669
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,320
that's sooner or later

670
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,040
But don't worry

671
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,800
If something happened

672
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760
I'm the only one responsible

673
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,639
won't involve you

674
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
This is the period of filial piety

675
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,080
poor meal

676
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,560
Your Highness, please forgive me

677
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,439
Grandpa has always been

678
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,080
against red tape

679
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,000
snort

680
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,199
but

681
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,679
if he knew

682
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,840
The father is now serving vegetables and tofu all day long

683
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,040
I'm afraid it's fun too.

684
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,080
don't speak

685
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,679
it seems

686
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,639
you really hate me

687
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,719
If there is anyone in the world

688
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,639
rule my destiny

689
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,719
cause me a lifetime of pain

690
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,080
i will kill

691
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,000
Your Highness is serious

692
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,040
slaves dare not

693
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,000
do not dare

694
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,439
still don't hate

695
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,199
Even with the ability to reach the sky

696
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,000
there's no way your mother

697
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,760
come back to life

698
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,879
So

699
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,159
can i do anything for you

700
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,399
Your Highness

701
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
over time

702
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,159
I have no regrets

703
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,280
I think

704
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:54,800

705
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
impossible to remarry

706
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,840

707
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:02,840
or die

708
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,760
I have no complaints

709
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,280

710
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,080

713
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,719
Whatever the Sun family

714
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,760

715
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,439
Yuan Qi

716
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:36,800
Yuan Qi

717
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,159
Your Highness

00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,159

719
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,040

727
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:22,719
I can't even say the truth

728
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,080
Yes

00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,600

I hate you

736
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,479
If His Highness does not kill the head

737
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,760

00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,239

746
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
Still in the period of filial piety

747
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,399
Your Majesty is vegetarian

748
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,919
You beast must be punished

749
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,159
This is the prince's inkstone

750
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,399
How can adults be punished at will

751
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,919
The emperor is keeping filial piety

752
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:48,879
How can the prince be an exception

753
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:50,800

Birds fly long sky fish swim shallow bottom

756
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,520
These are common sense

757
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:01,080
Why don't you go to Shanglin Garden?

758
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,360
Forcing tigers and leopards to eat fast too

759
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,280
Help Concubine Zhuang achieve her wish

760
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:14,040
By the hands of the crown prince

761
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:15,280
Go through the difficulties smoothly

762
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:16,879
what a good way

763
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
just thinking about it

764
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,760
Conquering the Heart of the East Palace

765
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:24,280
But when the victory

766
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280

767
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,239
self-destructing the Great Wall

768
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,399
Did you know that you do this

769
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,840
equal to the prince

770
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,239
Pushed back to Hu's side

771
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,800
Sir, even the East Palace is under surveillance

772
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:37,360
Who gave the courage

773
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,000
emperor

774
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,320
I'm not surveillance

775
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,479
I want to be promoted

776
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:45,639
Of course to please the prince

777
00:44:46,439 --> 00:44:47,520
I don't know how he does it

778
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,040
The old man's secret

779
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,840
more than me

780
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:56,840
So two people full of secrets

781
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,800
Can we cooperate?

782
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,639
adult kidding

783
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,520
Jin Yiwei's life

784
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,879
I can't do it

785
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Your enemy is not easy to deal with

786
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm afraid you haven't stood firm yet

787
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,439
lost his life

788
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,360
think carefully

789
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,959
I am waiting for your reply

790
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,479
I only laugh when I want to cry

791
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,280
so stupid
