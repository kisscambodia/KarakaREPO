1
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,440
Sun Niangniang's side

2
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,800
I wasn't ready to send the reunion cake at all.

3
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,519
what should I do

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,480
Didn't she send reunion cakes?

5
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:00,839
His Majesty

6
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,239
I'm good for her

7
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,519
She doesn't know

8
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,720
His Majesty

9
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,679
Actually this year

10
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,360
hesitating what

11
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,919
In fact, except for the queen mother this year

12
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,320
The palaces did not send reunion cakes

13
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,240
what
free at www.kisskh.me

14
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,679
The palaces send reunion cakes to Long Live

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,559
that's the rule

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,919
Long live who's reunion cake

17
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,080
compliment something

18
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,199
that's decent

19
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,279
what's up now

20
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,679
no more rules

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,919
Decent

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,279
Director Yuan

23
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,199
This queen concubine did not send

24
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,800
The masters below don't dare to send it.

25
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,199
How dare you

26
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,320
It's not good to go past the Empress.

27
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,240
Do you think this is the reason?

28
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,279
What about the grandmother?

29
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,279
she didn't send

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,479
what did you say

31
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,279
Slave Bai ran

32
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,279
Niang Niang made the reunion cake by herself

33
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,240
But then I ate it all by myself

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,639
line line

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,639
I tell you

36
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:07,880
look at

37
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,160
look at you

38
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:11,839
one more thing

39
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,119
Siyuan Bureau promises

40
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,399
your share this year

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,399
before your majesty

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,639
how thoughtful you can be

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,360
speak well

44
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,240
let's go

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
If you think about it, let's go

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,720
no one stops you

47
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,199
go

48
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,679
let's go see

49
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,520
Mid-autumn feast over there

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,399
how ready

51
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,119
sometimes

52
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,639
I really admire you

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,160
Have a good day, but

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,320
do not interfere

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,119
Concubine Guo Gui was buried for the late emperor

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,519
This made me so angry

57
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,720
always hold your position

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,359
sisters

59
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Seeing the fate of Guo Guifei

60
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,359
Don't dare to get close to you openly

61
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,200
you are at peace

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
think about it sometimes

63
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,559
It's not as good as at the Shang Food Bureau

64
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,399
be a cook

65
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,799
look at you now

66
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,160
what a pity

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
After the Mid-Autumn Festival

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
I will invite your majesty

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,160
Tasting sweet-scented osmanthus wine

70
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,920
This wine is exclusive

71
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,040
taste mellow

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,839
Will surely please His Majesty

73
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,559
Don't bother Wu Zhaoyi

74
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,440
worry about me

75
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,559
Master, you have such a good idea

76
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,160
I come

77
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,480
Okay

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Then I am for everyone

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,519
play a lute

80
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,640
the emperor arrives

81
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,640
Son-in-law sees mother-in-law

82
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,920
come and sit

83
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,760
free gift

84
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,559
good mother

85
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,000
ok

86
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,359
You are done with government affairs.

87
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,040
Brocade petals and gold mino weave several layers

88
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,239
Ask the fish what is compatible

89
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,200
Leap into the lotus room

90
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,519
Haodu Huachi Duhualong

91
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:55,359
This meal is called Lotus House Fish Bun

92
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,600
it absorbs

93
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,559
Natural aroma of honey and lotus leaves

94
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,000
A little sour in the mouth

95
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
very appetizing

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,039
King, you also try

97
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,640
queen mother

98
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,039
This soup is made from

99
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,599
Lianjuling
free at www.kisskh.me


100
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,599
three ingredients

101
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,440
Specially made sour cream

102
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:44,880
It's elegant

103
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,119
correct

104
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,400
Siyuan Bureau said

105
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,640
Insufficient supply of fruits and vegetables this year

106
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
to Shuntian

107
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,679
Take three thousand bunches of scabies

108
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,599
Five thousand bunches of reeds

109
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,919
Meng Shang Palace used to be in Shang Food Bureau for many years

110
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,520
now in charge

111
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Palace of the Forbidden City

112
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,119
i will ask you

113
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,400
The supply of vegetables and fruits is really insufficient

114
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,320
back to your majesty

115
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,599
The Empress Dowager's deep appreciation of luxury

116
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,760
lead by example

117
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,760
Intrauterine up-down effect

118
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,799
Simple and fashionable

119
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,359
This is the Mid-Autumn Festival

120
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,520
no banquet

121
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,080
so frugal

122
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,080
How can the supply be insufficient?

123
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:29,919
you're right

124
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,559
the whole Forbidden City

125
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,679
Vegetables and fruits don't use that much at all.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
i'm worried

127
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,440
just someone

128
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,919
Want to take the opportunity to blackmail

129
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,520
from this year

130
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,880
Fruit and vegetables supply throughout the Forbidden City

131
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,840
Always three minus two

132
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,919
Your Majesty is wise

133
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,960
This is

134
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,919
Yin Sishan

135
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,200
how dare

136
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Such crude food offerings

137
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,039
not withdraw yet

138
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,400
elder sister

139
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
what is that

140
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,559
His Majesty

141
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,919
This stuffing has bad meat and moss

142
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,559
Crispy and delicious

143
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,840
But

144
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,919
I really can't see

145
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,679
what's so special about this

146
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:08,919
back to your majesty

147
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,840
His Majesty's Early Years

148
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
Following Emperor Taizong's Northern Expedition

149
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,320
Most of the military

150
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,679
Chow mein noodles are dry food

151
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,679
today's slave

152
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,080
Made from wheat flour

153
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,200
tied with twine

154
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,280
easy to march

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,840
The slave also joined

156
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,520
salt and ginger juice to taste

157
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,559
Sprinkled with nourishing sesame seeds

158
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,320
Can also be filled with various meat fillings

159
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,640
slave tried

160
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,039
Guaranteed for a few days

161
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,359
Since my enthronement

162
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,919
Peace in the world

163
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,000
You don't have to go on an expedition

164
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,919
But before marching

165
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,520
In times of water shortage

166
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,799
Fried cornmeal noodles are hard to swallow

167
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,320
It's rare that you have this

168
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,880
Caring for the hearts of lieutenant soldiers

169
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,840
Then bake this recipe

170
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Teach the cook in the army

171
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,520
So the soldiers

172
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,320
hunting while training

173
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,559
can also be used

174
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,919
Yes

175
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,119
you are still food

176
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,599
Isn't it still missing the boss?

177
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,119
Yes

178
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,599
It's just that the two of her have little qualifications

179
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,359
The slaves are afraid that they will not be able to convince the public.

180
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,479
so

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,440
Then take the post temporarily

182
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,000
Waiting for you to tune in

183
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
Take charge again

184
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,479
Yes

185
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,679
Thank you Queen Mother

186
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,559
king try this

187
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,760
is the mother

188
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:21,799
His Majesty

189
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,640
note in reunion pie

190
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,520
you put it

191
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,039
In order to prepare osmanthus wine for you

192
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,840
Maid and concubine busy in the scorching sun

193
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,919
face all red

194
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,080
you look

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,719
you touch

196
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,159
do you touch

197
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,239
correct

198
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,960
Your Majesty would like to show your face

199
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,239
Wrong, not this one

200
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm looking for it

201
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,719
I'm going back to the banquet first

202
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,520
you slowly find

203
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,479
His Majesty

204
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:11,400
His Majesty

205
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,599
master

206
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
It's cold by the water, be careful

207
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,559
Slaves help you

208
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,000
this wine

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
Exclusive special products taste and mellow

210
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,799
Will surely please His Majesty

211
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,760
she teases me

212
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,440
She deliberately teased me

213
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,719
tell you to tease me

214
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,000
Master told you to tease me

215
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,280
master

216
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,599
come soon

217
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,200
Help

218
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,280
come soon

219
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,479
don't cry

220
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,159
still cry

221
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,359
did you hear

222
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,599
you are not allowed to cry

223
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,159
you are not allowed to cry

224
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,640
still cry

225
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,719
Cry again and I'll hit you again

226
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,599
master

227
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,080
why did you come out quietly

228
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,359
Slaves are looking for you everywhere

229
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,119
what are you looking for

230
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,560
That person's flute just now

231
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,239
i heard

232
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,959
Yin Sishan has been looking for you for a long time

233
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,280
go back

234
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,319
Pity

235
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,239
move

236
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
are you homesick

237
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,280
It's wrapped in lotus leaf

238
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,040
Fish scallops grilled in the scorching sun?

239
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,199
Yes

240
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,959
After picking in midsummer

241
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,479
preserved dried lotus leaves

242
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,920
Osmanthus wine was iced

243
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,400
It's just that the lake is too cold

244
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,119
Afraid of hurting the queen mother's body

245
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,839
So I took the wine and revisited it.

246
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,280
it's your idea

247
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,040
back to His Majesty

248
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,280
This is Zijin

249
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,680
This is the lady

250
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,359
Dedicated to the Queen Mother

251
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,719
It's the lotus leaf bream you made

252
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes

253
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,079
Boating on the lake in midsummer

254
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Climbing lotus leaves to make bream

255
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,239
wait for sunset

256
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,560
return with joy

257
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,280
Accompanied by Cinnamon Wine

258
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
Only the occasion

259
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,680
So this meal

260
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,239
should be a boat feast

261
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,520
Now this time
free at www.kisskh.me


262
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,920
lotus leaves have withered

263
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,800
I see this is not elegant

264
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,520
I remember the emperor

265
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,959
My favorite ever

266
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,000
It is said to be the dark connotation of lotus in the smell of wine

267
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,599
fun and elegant

268
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,160
how

269
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,040
you are busy now

270
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,599
No time to accompany us idlers

271
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,040
Flowers and wine tasting

272
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,160
The mother should have this Yaxing

273
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,880
I can always be there for you

274
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:39,760
but

275
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,560
Such arty thing

276
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,359
It's better to do less in the future

277
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,920
mother

278
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,079
I still have government affairs to deal with

279
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,160
Retire first

280
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,319
Your Majesty what's the matter

281
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,040
I don't like playing the piano and singing

282
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,280
lotus leaf mackerel

283
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,760
How did you offend him?

284
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,839
The lotus leaves are fragrant under the moon before the flowers

285
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,040
how fun

286
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,719
Why is it arty?

287
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,479
Bai studied for so long

288
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,280
Emperor even

289
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,000
I left without hearing

290
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,239
the emperor is gone

291
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,079
He's gone and we're more comfortable

292
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,359
keep singing and dancing

293
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,560
He doesn't like to hear me I like to hear

294
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,920
Didn't I ask you to report to the Qianqing Palace?

295
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
Why doesn't your majesty come to see me?

296
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,319
Your Majesty is busy with government affairs

297
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,479
I'm afraid it won't come

298
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's call the doctor for treatment.

299
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,239
you go you go

300
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,880
So that I can become a joke of the whole palace

301
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,400
master

302
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,640
Zhaoyi

303
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,199
Sun Niangniang brought the fairy porridge

304
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:17,760
say your majesty

305
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,239
are commonly used to treat cold

306
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,119
She's just mad at me

307
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,479
do not want

308
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,079
take it away

309
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,239
Yes

310
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,199
stop

311
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,439
bring it over

312
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,520
hot

313
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,719
She was just mad at me

314
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,560
smiling face

315
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,680
The knife is hidden in the smile

316
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,040
Wu Zhaoyi

317
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,599
Is the wind cold better?

318
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,079
People come to see me in person

319
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,959
You let people wait outside

320
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,040
my lord

321
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,599
Become a disrespectful person

322
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,880
I forgot to tell you just now

323
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,079
This tile altar is to be placed on the coals

324
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,760
Buried with charcoal

325
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,160
Boil until five and then take it

326
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,160
Don't miss the time

327
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,520
what is this

328
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,760
You drank fairy porridge just now

329
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,079
This is fairy rice

330
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,400
For you to ward off the cold and replenish your body

331
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,239
and

332
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,079
Tai Hospital has deployed a sense of wind spirit

333
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,680
Drinking together can drive away the cold

334
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm here to make amends for you

335
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
don't be angry, okay?

336
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,280
feelling better

337
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,959
you're really here to make amends

338
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,719
Since you are willing to apologize

339
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:29,719
deserve to be punished

340
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,680
This is what you said before

341
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,880
can't be fooled

342
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:37,839
OK

343
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:07,719
Mid-autumn night

344
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,439
Why is your majesty frowning?

345
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,239
I've always been coaxed by others

346
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:13,800
i really don't know

347
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,079
how to coax someone

348
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:16,800
What does Yunzhou think?

349
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:19,959
Your Majesty wants to coax

350
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,280
Naturally a woman

351
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,400
that's nature

352
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,839
Your Majesty sits on the country

353
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,959
The beauties in the world are picked by you

354
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,959
Today I will be troubled by a woman

355
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,400
I really don't understand

356
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,319
Someone told me before

357
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,880
I don't believe

358
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,280
His Majesty

359
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,920
Women's 矜 矜 妒

360
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,719
Excessive forbearance and petting

361
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,680
just make them get carried away

362
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,599
get carried away

363
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,160
you to this person

364
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,160
Maybe it's too much love

365
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,199
will tell her to take three inches

366
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,680
Borrowing pets to be arrogant

367
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,640
Is that right

368
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,880
you keep her cold

369
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,079
ignore her

370
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,640
some time later

371
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,439
Would you like to take a look at her

372
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,319
She also wants to thank Dade

373
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,959
you don't know her

374
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,119
His Majesty

375
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,839
All women are the same

376
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,839
For example, Concubine Guo

377
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,760
Loved by thousands

378
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,400
How arrogant and domineering

379
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:16,800
The emperor is cold

380
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,719
It's not a daily plea

381
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,199
Do you wash your face with tears?

382
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,439
You said earlier that Wu Zhaoyi fell into the water

383
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,760
your majesty

384
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,560
adult

385
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,640
Does this idea work?

386
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,280
God knows

387
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,560
On weekdays, she is the most hypocritical

388
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,920
Why don't you invite Jiang Siyao to take a look?

389
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,479
Your Majesty has fallen asleep

390
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,119
Bold, you dare to stop

391
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,560
His Majesty

392
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,800
His Majesty

393
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,439
His Majesty

394
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
Medicated meals are most afraid of missing the time

395
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:24,920
my master

396
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
Please Sun Niangniang five watch

397
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Open the altar by yourself

398
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,079
That's left to rest

399
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,560
I see she is

400
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,880
It's the one who is mad at me on purpose

401
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:36,560
Okay

402
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,119
great

403
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,160
wake up

404
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,839
Woke up

405
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,079
Get up and take medicine

406
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
why are you still here

407
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,199
you make me five

408
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,520
I want you to get up and take medicine.

409
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,719
forget

410
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,479
At last you still know what you say

411
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,280
you sit tight

412
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,719
Your Majesty came to see you last night

413
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,680
you fell asleep

414
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,520
he's gone

415
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
why don't you wake me up

416
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,160
Wu Zhaoyi

417
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:08,920
make you sit still

418
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
Alright alright Yao Zijin

419
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,760
stop moving

420
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,319
let me out

421
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,680
you let me out

422
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,760
Yao Zijin

423
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,920
stop kicking

424
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,400
Did you fall?

425
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,280
The Queen said yesterday

426
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,239
Not spicy enough

427
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,000
Today, it is said that the bitterness is too strong

428
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,839
how do you cook porridge

429
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,280
Souji Zen

430
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,920
All slaves are

431
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,880
According to the Department of Pharmacy

432
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,119
Boiled with the medicated recipe

433
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:39,880
less oil

434
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I really don't dare to miss a star and a half.

435
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,640
you are quibbling

436
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:43,839
I

437
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,160
hand out

438
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,119
what are you doing

439
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,920
Meals at Kunning Palace

440
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
she's so ignorant

441
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,359
Shouldn't it be taught?

442
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,959
Souji Zen

443
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,319
I really follow the recipe

444
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,439
weighed carefully

445
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,959
Never dare to make mistakes

446
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,000
you still argue

447
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,439
so neglectful

448
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,119
how do i explain to the queen

449
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:16,920
stop fighting

450
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,599
Yin Sishan

451
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,640
you are just now

452
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,959
Temporarily in charge of Shang Food Bureau

453
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:26,719
I have to teach a lesson

454
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,520
little cook
free at www.kisskh.me


455
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,640
you also want to intervene

456
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,040
She's going to the palaces to deliver meals soon

457
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:31,920
let the masters

458
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,400
see the scar on her hand

459
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,920
would be mistaken for Su Sishan

460
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
to treat deliberately

461
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,640
How about this

462
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:38,959
from today

463
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,280
Medicinal food in Kunning Palace

464
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,560
I will personally supervise

465
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:42,920
If there are more mistakes

466
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,079
I will be responsible

467
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,599
Don't worry now

468
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Yin Sishan

469
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,640
i don't really don't

470
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,000
don't you be afraid

471
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:05,880
I will help you myself

472
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,439
Weigh the medicine to taste

473
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,719
Until the queen is satisfied

474
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,359
ok

475
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:14,640
let's go

476
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,520
If you replace the previous

477
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,880
Yin Ziping jumped up early

478
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,359
It's calmer now

479
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,760
You are so generous

480
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
She took your place in the palm of your hand

481
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,119
you are not angry

482
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,959
The Queen Mother said at the Ministry of Industry

483
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,239
palace palace

484
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:36,119
Need 9,000 pieces of silk leno

485
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,680
they want to beg your majesty

486
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,000
Order Suzhou and Hangzhou to step up weaving

487
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,079
Carefully checked by slaves

488
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,959
what the inner government really needs

489
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,199
less than them

490
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,400
half of the required

491
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,280
The country is based on the people

492
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,119
national security

493
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,959
When the Emperor was present

494
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Multiple calls to stop the non-urgent task

495
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,239
how long has it been

496
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,520
They did it again

497
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,520
name in the palace

498
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,560
Looting everywhere

499
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,640
Ninety percent go to the private government

500
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,319
These beetles are really hateful

501
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,359
queen

502
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,040
queen

503
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,680
Daughter-in-law is ill

504
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,760
a momentary lapse

505
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,280
Please forgive my mother

506
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:30,560
go down first

507
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,920
Yes

508
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,439
slaves understand

509
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,680
Concubine Hui's chess skills have improved a lot.

510
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,239
But your chess style

511
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,079
Your Majesty thinks

512
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,599
How is the chess style of the courtier and concubine?

513
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,040
on weekdays

514
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,400
you are always on the offensive

515
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,000
forward and not backward

516
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,599
But today

517
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,000
You know how to do it step by step

518
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Surprisingly

519
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,640
It is very beneficial

520
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,599
His Majesty had previously given three sons to his concubines

521
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,400
Now let me everywhere

522
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,479
Don't lose too fast

523
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,359
This is His Majesty's concubine

524
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,520
leave a face

525
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:24,839
Waiting for the concubine to return

526
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,160
study hard for a while

527
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,800
Your Majesty will be impressed

528
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,839
It seems that Concubine Hui is behind

529
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,160
Have a good teacher

530
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,319
no more

531
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,479
His Majesty

532
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,719
His Majesty

533
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,199
empress

534
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,479
Does the emperor see

535
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,520
you invited the grandmother of the sun

536
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,760
Let's break the last mess

537
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,280
His Majesty

538
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,639
The King of Han sent people

539
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,840
Mid-autumn festival gift

540
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,520
Heavy rain delayed the journey for several days

541
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,760
just arrived in Beijing

542
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,439
Unfune

543
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,479
look at my uncle

544
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,320
really care about me

545
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,600
Looks like I'm going to rewrite it too

546
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,199
Thank you very much thank him

547
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:40,679
His Majesty

548
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,919
Wei Chen is worried

549
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,679
The Han government came to borrow the reason for the gift

550
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,360
The truth of prying

551
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,560
Emperor Ancestor and Emperor Kao

552
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,679
The King of Han was every festival

553
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,639
come to celebrate

554
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,879
now

555
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,520
He's just following the old rules

556
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,360
Moreover

557
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,360
I treat my uncle

558
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,320
Be honest everywhere

559
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,080
The world sees

560
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,239
I believe

561
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
He won't let me down like that, will he?

562
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,639
Yes

563
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,479
go down

564
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,399
who taught you the tune

565
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,399
go out

566
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:01,919
His Majesty

567
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,639
The slaves returned from Yongcheng and returned to life

568
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,280
let you not mention you

569
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,800
Your Majesty just now

570
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,280
isn't it fine?

571
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,520
what the servant said to you

572
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,000
you must not forget

573
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,520
who let you in

574
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,959
How could Eunuch Yuan have such courage?

575
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,399
The concubines went to the Queen Mother's Palace to say hello

576
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:11,520
the queen mother

577
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,879
To bring snacks to His Majesty

578
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,280
concubines

579
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,719
volunteered to send

580
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,360
If your majesty does not welcome concubines

581
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,239
Just leave

582
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,280
The concubine knew that His Majesty was tired

583
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,840
never disturb your rest

584
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,600
Just here to accompany you for a while

585
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,399
What did the concubine do wrong?

586
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,280
This scent doesn't suit you

587
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:00,080
I will send you better

His Majesty

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,239
Slaves don't dare anymore

i keep her cold

608
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,600
I just want her to think about herself

609
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,600
I don't want to see her swaying in front of me

610
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,520
But she's haunted

611
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,000
Wherever she goes, her business

612
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,800
shaking

613
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,239
It makes my head dizzy

614
00:38:57,879 --> 00:39:00,199
