1
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,239
Some people fish the village and oppress the people

2
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,839
A name will be erased from the official record

3
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:57,239
His head will be hung high in the firewood market

4
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,839
I reuse these people

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,519
Is to let every official

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,519
Hanging in the heart day and night

7
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,119
Always remember to be honest and be an official

8
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,559
Be kind to the people

9
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,240
Grandpa Emperor

10
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,000
Criminal law can naturally deter officials

11
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,080
But those are weak women

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Zhanji

13
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,360
How many years have I succeeded to the throne

14
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,320
Always introspect from time to time

15
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,679
I just hope that one day

16
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,399
Wherever I subdue the people

17
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:39,039
Can live and work in peace and contentment and share peace

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,199
What I want

19
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,520
It is a real prosperous time

20
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,679
They are my eyes and my ears

21
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:52,119
Patrol the four sides and monitor the world for me

22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,839
The government is so, so is the harem

23
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,399
My harem

24
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,919
I don't know how many other people's eyes and ears

25
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,880
And how many spies from other countries

26
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,039
Such a weak woman

27
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,320
I can't afford it

28
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,479
Your grandpa and grandchildren are worried about you

29
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,839
There are 26 people on trial this time

30
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,759
There will be crazy rumors of good people

31
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,360
Said you tortured a confession

32
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
Involving more than 2,000 people

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,479
Some people even said that you personally supervised the chop

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,759
Bloodstained Forbidden City

35
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,839
Grandchildren don't want to hear anyone

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,880
To tarnish your reputation

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,279
I don't want to hear anyone

38
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,800
Say you are not at all

39
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,000
I am the king of the world and the father of all peoples

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
Twenty years on the throne

41
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,800
Never slack off early and late

42
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,279
Thoughts and thoughts

43
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:46,360
It is nothing more than the cold, warm and hungry of the people

44
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,839
The trivial matters in the palace are also personally supervised and cut

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,119
Am I that idle

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,600
The person who preaches ballads is really the light of rats' eyes

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,360
Stupid

48
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,800
Although it is a rumor,

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,039
But if you let Yu climb and bite again,

50
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,839
I'm afraid more innocent people will be implicated

51
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,119
Grandpa Emperor

52
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,839
Can you look at your grandchildren's points

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,479
Severely punish the first evil

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Release the others

55
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,639
Then

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,520
How to distinguish who is the first evil

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Who are the accomplices

58
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,320
Zhan Ji

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,399
Go back and read your book well and be your fault

60
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,200
In the future, Dechengye will

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,200
To live up to my high hopes for you

62
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
This little thing

63
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,720
It's not your business

64
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,480
Go home

65
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,959
It is the grandson who leaves

66
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,519
My Lord, she confessed

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,519
Who

68
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,720
It's a prince

69
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,559
Dare to slander the prince of the current dynasty

70
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,799
It was the prince who instructed me to kill the emperor

71
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,359
Behind the scenes is the present prince

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,279
Keep people well

73
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,079
I will enter the palace immediately

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Yes

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Empress Zhuang Fei

76
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,239
Empress Zhuang Fei

77
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:04,720
Empress

78
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,839
Help me help me help me

79
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,359
Wait a minute

80
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,160
Here

81
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,279
This is water

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,160
And

83
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,359
This is fried rice

84
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,320
Empress

85
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,279
Fried rice is easy to store

86
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,040
Not easy to break

87
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,119
You put the rest on your body

88
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Don't let anyone find out

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,519
Good

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,880
Hurry up

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,399
Can you tell the Crown Princess for me

92
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,119
You tell her to talk to the emperor

93
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,519
I'm innocent

94
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,079
I was not involved in the rebellion

95
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,320
Empress

96
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,480
On weekdays, you

97
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,559
Be in the same room with Li Zhaoyi and Yu Meiren

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Didn't you find anything unusual

99
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,640
I've always been kind to her

100
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,640
I don't know why she trapped me in injustice

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,399
Think about it carefully

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
She has been angry at every turn in the past two months

103
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,000
It's like a different person

104
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,959
I don't know

105
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,200
I don't understand either

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,640
Zi Jin

107
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
Go, go, go, go

108
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,959
No, don't go

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,799
Wait a minute

110
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,320
Don't leave without me

111
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,920
Empress, we will come again

112
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,040
Quick, quick, quick

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,359
Go

114
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,320
Ziliao, where have you been

115
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,880
The snacks I made were returned as they were

116
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
It's a good reprimand

117
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,079
If I had known this

118
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,519
I won't be on duty for you

119
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,959
You loser

120
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,679
Miss Yao is still going to trouble you this time

121
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Your Highness can't persuade

122
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,479
I know

123
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,280
The more Grandpa Huang values me

124
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,640
The more I don't want people to talk in my ear

125
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,840
If I dissuade you

126
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm afraid it will involve more

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,719
Your Highness

128
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,719
Perfunctory

129
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:58,840
Tell her to redo it

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,320
Yes

131
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,440
Wait

132
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,640
It's done. Let her deliver it in person

133
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,520
Your Highness, are you summoning her

134
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,799
Go quickly

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,520
Yes

136
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,559
There are rules for concubines in the palace according to their grades

137
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,919
Although Yu Meiren has no pet,

138
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,919
It won't be so frugal

139
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,440
Eat so little

140
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,000
This is to become immortal

141
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
Miss Yao

142
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,599
Why are you still wearing this dress?

143
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,679
Change clothes quickly. Change clothes

144
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,039
You're lucky Your Highness summoned you

145
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,679
Go quickly

146
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,159
Go quickly

147
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Purple Azolla

148
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,679
Why are you staring at this

149
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,559
You go quickly

150
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:16,840
Quick, quick, quick

151
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,039
Your Highness, something happened to the East Palace

152
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,919
Miss Yao, slow down

153
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,479
Is it heavy? Let me hold it for you

154
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,679
Watch your step

155
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,559
Let me hold it for you

156
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,119
Miss Yao

157
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,760
Just a moment

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,960
Your Highness Your Highness

159
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,239
People are coming. People are coming

160
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,960
Your Highness has something urgent to talk about later

161
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,640
What is it

162
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,679
What is it

163
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,239
You guys

164
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,559
Hurry and follow it

165
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,440
Go, go, go

166
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,719
Miss Yao

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,239
Why don't you wait here first

168
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,559
Your Highness seems to have something to do

169
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:04,799
Wait a minute

170
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,479
It's father-in-law Yuan

171
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,679
You follow me and light me up

172
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:07,679
Quickly

173
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,119
Follow me. Hurry up. Hurry up

174
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,159
Your Royal Highness Temple can't make it

175
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,440
You get out of here

176
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
Your Highness Your Highness

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,840
Your Highness can't make it

178
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,479
Let go

179
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,200
Or I'll strangle you first

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,719
Your Highness

181
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,960
Your Highness

182
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,640
Let go

183
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,239
Your Royal Highness Your Royal Highness

184
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,760
Your Highness

185
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,039
This is it

186
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,039
Absolutely not

187
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,719
Your Highness

188
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,760
Your Highness

189
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:00,960
Step down

190
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
Back off

191
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,799
You also give me back

192
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,880
Your Highness, what are you doing

193
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,119
Just in time you came

194
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,080
I have a few words to transmit to my father

195
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,960
Bother you to do it for me

196
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,679
For more than twenty years

197
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,400
Father led the army to the north

198
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,799
I have supervised the country four times

199
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,320
Vertical details and minor reasons

200
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,320
Dare not neglect

201
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,960
But my father believes in the rumors of adulterers

202
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,640
East Palace ministers are often imprisoned and don't say

203
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,359
I am even more afraid and treading on thin ice

204
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,000
Now

205
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:45,080
My father believed in Yu's formation of me

206
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,880
This, this, this

207
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,400
This is really unreasonable

208
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,640
People often say that

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,880
Son doesn't say father's fault

210
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,320
I've been holding it back for more than 20 years

211
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,640
I have to say this today

212
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,960
I know my father loves my second brother

213
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,799
Want to make him prince

214
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,679
I can put up with it

215
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,119
I can even make

216
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,159
But I have to say this today

217
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
You help me down first

218
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,239
Jun Haozhi

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,000
Then I will do it

220
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,400
Upward

221
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,080
Then the people follow it

222
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,679
But my father trusts the Royal Guards and the Neihuan

223
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
Yu Xia multi-purpose heavy code

224
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,559
In the long run

225
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,840
There must be more cruel officials in the court

226
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,520
Folk associations will attack the wind

227
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,000
This

228
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,440
This is very wrong

229
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,479
Help me up

230
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:50,719
Don't move

231
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,119
Your Highness, I am today

232
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:54,479
Your Highness

233
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:54,840
I

234
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,799
Don't, Your Highness

235
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,239
Your Highness, what are you doing

236
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:58,960
You also stand down

237
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,400
One more step forward and I'll die for you

238
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,919
No, no, no

239
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,080
Your Highness Your Highness

240
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,440
Think about it carefully

241
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,119
She has been angry at every turn in the past two months

242
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,960
It's like a different person

243
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
I don't know

244
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,119
I don't understand either

245
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,960
Although Yu Meiren has no pet,

246
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
It won't be so frugal

247
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,760
Eat so little

248
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
This is to become immortal

249
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,200
It's wrong. He's wrong

250
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,919
No, your highness, your highness

251
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,599
Your Highness

252
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,280
You

253
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,080
Back off

254
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't come over here

255
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,599
You take a step forward now

256
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,880
I'll die for you to see

257
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm coming

258
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,719
What will my father have to say

259
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,840
I will definitely convey it to Grandpa Huang truthfully

260
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:40,679
You

261
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,359
You, you still come to mad at me at this time

262
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,599
I'm just following my father's instructions

263
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
I didn't mean to annoy you

264
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,640
He he he

265
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,679
He's mad at me

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,200
He did it on purpose. He did it on purpose

267
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,559
Do you want me to die for you now

268
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:56,960
Your Highness

269
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,719
You child

270
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,039
Why are you fooling around like your father

271
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,039
How old are you

272
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
Still like a child

273
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
Dad has something to say. Come down and say it

274
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,680
I won't come down

275
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,119
Come down

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,359
No less

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,400
I-I haven't gone up yet

278
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,640
How can we talk about it

279
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,680
Your Highness

280
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,359
1

281
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,800
II

282
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,400
III

283
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,280
Your Highness

284
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,040
Your Highness Your Highness

285
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,280
Your Highness

286
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Your Highness, are you all right? Are you all right

287
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Love Princess

288
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,920
Scared me to death

289
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
It killed me

290
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,160
Father has nothing to do. I'll go back first

291
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,079
Love Princess

292
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
Your Highness

293
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,239
Since your highness is safe and sound,

294
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,280
My body also retired first

295
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,439
Your Highness, rest early

296
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,839
Your Highness, you scared me to death

297
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,719
You you

298
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,680
How can you thunder and not rain

299
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,439
I'm shouting here

300
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
Can you hear it outside the temple

301
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,920
Back to His Royal Highness the Prince

302
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,520
There was so much noise just now

303
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,760
I heard it naturally

304
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,599
Help me up

305
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,520
I just want the emperor to

306
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,040
I just want my father to hear me

307
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,160
My son is wronged

308
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,079
Tell them

309
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,439
Prepare meals at once

310
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm hungry

311
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes

312
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,680
Your Highness, what does this mean

313
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,079
I'm confused

314
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,920
Your Highness

315
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,599
Go and check Yu's family for me at once

316
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,599
Yes

317
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,160
Yuan Qi

318
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,160
Yuan Qi

319
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,599
Your Highness

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,439
Your Highness

321
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,560
The handmaiden stayed

322
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,040
No retention

323
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,281
Let's tear down the door later

324
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,921
Anyway, closing the door is useless

325
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:03,161
Yes

326
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:05,440
Lord You

327
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,401
Is this coming back to search for the palace maidservant who took the title again

328
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:09,921
Yu's confession

329
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,921
The Prince had ordered her to poison His Majesty's diet

330
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:15,840
Guanglu Temple Food Bureau is also involved

331
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,921
Meng Shang Shi

332
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:18,401
I'm sorry

333
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:19,801
According to Daming Law

334
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:20,641
Conviction of officials

335
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:22,360
A formal trial is required to finalize the case

336
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,881
I respectfully ask the Holy Judgment

337
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,041
Inside the harem

338
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,440
Gong Zhengsi is in charge of picketing the Imperial Palace

339
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,041
Today, I am the female official of Zhengwupin Imperial Palace

340
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,681
Even if you want to interrogate and detain

341
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,041
Should be detained in Gongzhengsi

342
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,360
Instead of Zhenfu Prison

343
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,401
Why bother the Royal Guards

344
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,240
This kind of case can't be tried by Gong Zhengsi

345
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,041
Had to wronged Meng Shang to eat

346
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:43,801
Take away

347
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:44,561
Wait a minute

348
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:50,761
The sinner Yu Shi is the one who denounced me

349
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,360
Or the whole food bureau

350
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,921
It is natural that no one knows if they want to go against each other

351
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,960
Good

352
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,161
Since it's just me

353
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:02,840
Just imprison and interrogate me

354
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:04,001
Meng Shang Shi

355
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:04,921
Your Excellency

356
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,281
Nayu's family

357
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,440
Openly arguing with Guo Bianfei at the flower banquet

358
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,281
May be holding a grudge for a long time

359
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,521
Do not hesitate to frame the prince

360
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:15,440
Involve the whole food bureau

361
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,681
Please also learn from you that you should not be blinded by Yu's family

362
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,001
When will it be your turn to speak

363
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:26,521
Lord You

364
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,001
Shang Shi Bureau is in charge of court meals

365
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,840
It is the most important place in the palace

366
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:32,120
If you want to be detained,

367
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,360
Why don't you detain me?

368
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:34,681
Let Meng Shang eat first

369
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:36,401
I'm also the duty

370
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Dare not neglect and indulge

371
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,561
I have to wronged three people

372
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,921
Take away

373
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:45,521
Rest assured

374
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,881
You have no real evidence at all

375
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,440
How can you take people away easily

376
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:51,041
Just because of a sinner's words

377
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:51,801
As of today

378
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,401
Present noble people's meals

379
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,001
Have to go through careful interrogation

380
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:56,561
If there is a flaw

381
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,001
It's not Masahiro Miyagi waiting for you

382
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,001
It's Zhenfu's prison

383
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:03,720
Trust me

384
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,720
You don't want to know

385
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,041
What kind of a place is that

386
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:10,720
Zi Jin

387
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
What shall we do

388
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,080
I haven't sent anything to Zhuang Fei for three days

389
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
They guard like this

390
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:11,600
We can't get out at all

391
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,281
I still have to think of another way

392
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:19,681
Don't be rash

393
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,801
Quickly

394
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,281
This

395
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,440
Have something to eat

396
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Even if you have to keep it

397
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,360
You can't stay water and rice all day, can you

398
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:05,281
Please

399
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,681
Come here

400
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:11,761
Walk over

401
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,041
Come

402
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:17,440
So fragrant

403
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:18,320
Come

404
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,521
Come on, give it to me, give it to me

405
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:20,921
Come

406
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,681
Empress Zhuang Fei

407
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:14,801
Empress Zhuang Fei

408
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,600
Take down

409
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,120
How come every time I see you

410
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:33,200
Make me say the same thing

411
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:40,521
Take away

412
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:13,440
Your Excellency

413
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,120
It's just a little palace maid

414
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:16,401
Can't stand the scare

415
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:18,200
Take her for a walk in prison

416
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,401
Tomorrow's confession is all ready

417
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,720
Is it

418
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,641
She can say whatever she wants her to say

419
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,521
Keep it verbatim

420
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,840
Your Majesty

421
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:01,840
The palace maid of Shangshi Bureau has confessed

422
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,080
Princess Zhuang was imprisoned after the incident

423
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,960
Meng Shangshi disobeyed the imperial edict

424
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,480
Private palace maidservants deliver meals

425
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,440
It can be seen that Yu's Zhuang Fei

426
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:11,001
There is indeed collusion between the Food Bureau

427
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,240
Just take what you said to me

428
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,120
Yu and others conspired against each other

429
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,600
When and where to poison

430
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,281
Say it one by one

431
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,881
Lord You

432
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,281
Don't inflict heavy punishment on me

433
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:25,001
What does your Lord ask the handmaiden to say

434
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,161
Handmaidens are willing to confess

435
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,600
Father, did you hear me

436
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,761
The Royal Guards used heavy punishment to persecute innocent people

437
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,401
My son is really wronged

438
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:40,761
This is the command

439
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:42,681
How dare you talk nonsense

440
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:47,281
Tell the truth

441
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,921
Lord You

442
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,480
He insisted

443
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,440
Don't say we were plotting to poison

444
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,041
I just haven't had time to do it yet

445
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,200
It coincides with Yu Niangniang's bedtime

446
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:04,281
This is the opportunity to set fire

447
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,960
Yu Niangniang

448
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:10,881
The handmaiden didn't say anything

449
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,440
Didn't say anything about your illness

450
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,161
The handmaiden really didn't say anything

451
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,801
Yu Niangniang

452
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:17,921
Handmaiden handmaiden didn't say anything

453
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:21,240
Your Majesty

454
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,320
Yu Shi, she obviously harbored evil intentions

455
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,320
What's the disease

456
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,840
A palace maid who is still in the food bureau

457
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,281
How did you know about it

458
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:34,161
Handmaiden

459
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,960
Handmaiden

460
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:38,281
Shake what

461
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,440
What do you want to say clearly

462
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,761
Your Majesty makes decisions for you

463
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
Yes yes

464
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:46,320
The handmaiden thought

465
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,921
Recently

466
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,080
Yu Niangniang's food list has changed greatly

467
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,041
There are often palace maidservants taking honey and candied fruit

468
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,001
The palace people talked privately

469
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,240
They said that Yu Niangniang was strangely ill

470
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:04,440
Your Majesty

471
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,600
The handmaiden has just entered the palace

472
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,600
I don't even know the way to the palace

473
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,521
Lord You insisted on taking away the handmaiden

474
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:12,521
Ask what conspiracy

475
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,561
Handmaiden really doesn't know anything

476
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,840
Your Majesty, forgive your life. Your Majesty, forgive your life

477
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:18,521
Father

478
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,080
My son is really wronged

479
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,120
Your Majesty

480
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:30,120
I asked the Imperial Doctor to treat Yu in court

481
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:36,600
An audience with Imperial Doctor Xuan Sheng

482
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:41,281
What's the use of checking

483
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,761
Why not tell you

484
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,360
The prince wants to kill your majesty

485
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,600
Because he's tired of waiting

486
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,720
Can't wait to be emperor

487
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,120
I

488
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,600
Be left out for many years

489
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:06,120
Suffering from the slow treatment and bullying of the whole palace

490
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,001
I'm tired of living

491
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,120
Yu's

492
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,960
Your Majesty doesn't often see you

493
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,360
But treat you well

494
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,720
How can there be so much resentment

495
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
How can you be so vicious

496
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,120
Want to bury all of us with you

497
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:22,600
Princess Zhuang

498
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,720
Do you think your Majesty really dotes on you

499
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:30,921
We're just royal thrushes

500
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,521
Oriole

501
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,320
They will be released one day

502
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:39,080
But we

503
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,480
You can only boil until you grow old

504
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,561
Drop to tooth drop

505
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,041
Your Majesty

506
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
Your Majesty

507
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,600
Since I didn't mean it,

508
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:56,401
Why did you hurt my life, sire

509
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,600
Crazy woman

510
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,281
Chen Shengyin visits Your Majesty

511
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:13,881
Sheng Tai Yi

512
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,840
Please feel Yu's pulse

513
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,881
Yes

514
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:30,320
Check what to judge what

515
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,001
What's there to check

516
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,561
This pulse

517
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:47,521
This pulse is soft on the left

518
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:48,281
Right inch off

519
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:49,360
What exactly is the disease

520
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,401
From the pulse condition,

521
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:55,881
The patient has chest obstruction and heartache for more than three years

522
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
Nowadays, the medicine stone is ineffective

523
00:32:58,561 --> 00:32:59,641
Time is running out

524
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,561
As for eating candied fruit

525
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:04,561
It must be heart failure and bitter taste

526
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:05,480
Your Majesty

527
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:07,921
You can kill me

528
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,401
Your Majesty, I beg you

529
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:10,681
You can kill me

530
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:11,320
Your Majesty

531
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,320
Your Majesty, you heard it with your own ears

532
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,600
Yu Shi, she has lost all hope

533
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,561
Holding the mind of dying with everyone

534
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,881
Male and female servants and others are wronged

535
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:24,161
Your Majesty's Sage

536
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:26,761
Return the innocence of male and female servants and concubines

537
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:28,641
Father

538
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,200
Such a terminally ill woman

539
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Crazy talk, crazy talk

540
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,561
Is it trustworthy

541
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,521
Even if my son finds someone to coordinate

542
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,281
How can you find such a precarious person

543
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,360
Is my son in the eyes of my father

544
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,041
Is it really a fool who is wanton and frivolous

545
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,921
Father

546
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:56,881
Who gave you the courage to frame the prince

547
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:57,600
Say

548
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:02,641
I can't let you bury me

549
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,080
What a pity

550
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,080
Prince Ye

551
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,320
Don't blame me

552
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,681
Blame your good side princess

553
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,121
She openly bullied

554
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,001
I'm a poor man

555
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,240
I have to come to settle accounts with you

556
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,321
As long as your East House falls

557
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,761
What vengeance do I have that I can't avenge

558
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:30,041
The more people I have on the road, the better

559
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,480
Yu Shi, you still refuse to tell the truth

560
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:43,001
Grandpa Emperor

561
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,561
A few days ago

562
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,160
Someone sent an altar of gold to Yu's home

563
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:49,400
And promised to take care of her parents for life

564
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,761
Yu knows that his life will not be long

565
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,200
He promised to deliberately set fire to the prince

566
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,720
Nowadays, witness and physical evidence

567
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,521
The eunuchs who spread the news inside and outside are waiting for the decree outside the temple

568
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:01,680
Who is the mastermind

569
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,601
What do you say, Uncle

570
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:10,041
Zhu Zhanji

571
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,761
What have I got to do with this

572
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,521
Grandpa Emperor

573
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:14,960
After inquiry

574
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,001
Someone recognized

575
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,200
The one who sent the gold was the chief attendant of Han Wangfu

576
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,160
Fracture

577
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,200
This is a naked structure

578
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,960
Father

579
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:28,321
I have never seen this woman before

580
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,121
I didn't send any gold to Yu's family

581
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:33,121
Father, you have to believe me

582
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:34,801
If I want to frame the prince,

583
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:36,640
Be sure to go unnoticed

584
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,480
How can people claim to be people in Han Wangfu

585
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:41,440
Isn't this waiting to be exposed

586
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,601
Someone must have framed the prince

587
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,880
I want to alienate our royal flesh and blood again

588
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,761
Father Ming Jian, father

589
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:51,521
Don't worry, uncle

590
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,920
Say it slowly if you have grievances

591
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,880
Can I not be in a hurry

592
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,720
Who can not be framed in a hurry

593
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,880
My son is really wronged

594
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,281
Father Ming Jian

595
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:03,521
Second uncle, don't make a gaffe in front of the temple

596
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:08,001
Zhanji, you believe in your uncle, don't you

597
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:10,160
Tell Grandpa Huang quickly

598
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,801
Second uncle is wronged

599
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:13,801
Wronged

600
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,720
That's enough

601
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,121
Send Princess Zhuang back to the palace first

602
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,400
Yu's prison will be retried in the future

603
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:27,761
Yes

604
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,920
Your Majesty still thinks the food bureau is innocent

605
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,521
Let it go together

606
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,801
Father Emperor Father Emperor

607
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:41,281
You believe me, don't you

608
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:42,400
Big Brother

609
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:47,801
The third child

610
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,761
The third child

611
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:00,920
Please stay, Lord You

612
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,321
What do you want from Your Highness

613
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,081
Lord You

614
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,400
Do you ever think

615
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,041
What's so weird about this thing

616
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:12,880
This is not a conspiracy at all

617
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,761
Yu's life will not be long

618
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,841
And resent the rudeness of the Eastern Palace concubine

619
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:18,361
Want to burn everything

620
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,720
Will frame the prince

621
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,720
Involve innocent people

622
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,801
As for what to do with Hanwang

623
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,680
Since your majesty has not made a clear decree,

624
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:26,281
Nature can't be investigated

625
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Please forgive my grandson

626
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:29,440
How do I feel

627
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:31,400
Witness and material evidence

628
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,680
It's like everything is waiting for me

629
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
As long as the truth comes out

630
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,001
It is good that the prince is safe

631
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,200
His Royal Highness Taisun, Wei Chen, retired

632
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,841
Empress watch your step

633
00:37:57,281 --> 00:37:58,920
Thank you for just

634
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,480
Let's go

635
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:20,761
Why are you following me

636
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,680
Fuck off

637
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,121
Fuck off

638
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:31,200
Han Wang is so furious

639
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:32,640
What's the use

640
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:35,920
Release comes quickly

641
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,801
Look at you like this

642
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:40,801
It seems to have suffered a great injustice

643
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,400
How

644
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,640
Even you think I bought Yu's

645
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,521
Frame Prince

646
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,761
Isn't it

647
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:51,200
Buy off a terminally ill woman

648
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
To assassinate the father

649
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,361
Frame Prince

650
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,200
But also leave witness and physical evidence

651
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,920
In your heart

652
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,960
Am I so stupid

653
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:01,841
In this way

654
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,121
It's like someone deliberately alienated

655
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:05,720
Not Zhu Gaochi

656
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,841
It won't be Zhu Zhanji

657
00:39:08,361 --> 00:39:08,960
Why

658
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,321
My eldest brother reads the book of sages

659
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,321
Believe in the art of leniency and saint

660
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:15,521
He can't do such a thing

661
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:17,761
As for the boy Zhu Zhanji,

662
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:19,960
More shrewd than Big Brother

663
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,200
How could you try to frame me

664
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,960
What about bringing trouble to your biological father

665
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:28,160
That is, someone deliberately led him to verify

666
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:31,801
Who could this man be

667
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:49,480
Pay tribute

668
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,920
Inverse

669
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,041
If it were you

670
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,240
Pass by many times

671
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,761
His Royal Highness Han Wang didn't recognize his own son

672
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:05,960
How

673
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:07,640
I recognize it now

674
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:08,880
See this tombstone

675
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,400
What else can't I guess

676
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:12,720
Take a closer look at you

677
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,281
Not born like me at all

678
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:17,200
It's more like that bitch

679
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:23,880
Sovereign, Sovereign, calm down

680
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,720
Sovereign

681
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:25,601
Bitch

682
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:28,960
King Wang Ye

683
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,081
Bitch

684
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:35,041
Mother

685
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:36,880
After your mother died

686
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,801
You sneaked out of the palace

687
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,801
I sent people to find nothing

688
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,281
For so many years

689
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,440
Your appearance and temperament have changed greatly

690
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,521
When I first saw you,

691
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,720
Or will you have doubts

692
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:50,480
It seems that seven years ago

693
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:53,281
The body in Jinan looks like you

694
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,640
It's also the maze of your cloth

695
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,200
The emperor went out in distress

696
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
You have been meritorious in rescuing the driver

697
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,640
Since then, he has been transferred to Beijing

698
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:05,521
Go all the way to the top

699
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,761
But how strict is the selection of Royal Guards

700
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:10,200
Did the emperor know for a long time

701
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,321
A maid gives birth to a child

702
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:15,321
Never got an audience with the emperor's grandfather

703
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,160
Who will know who I am

704
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,761
Then neither should you

705
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,880
For a woman who disobeys her husband

706
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,281
Designing to frame one's biological father

707
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:26,960
Now you know what it's like to be wronged

708
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:29,761
My mother was innocently wronged and had an affair with others

709
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,001
I don't even have a chance to defend myself

710
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,601
She is more wronged than you

711
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,841
A hundred times more painful than you

712
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,281
Bastard

713
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,041
You can really ignore your father

714
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:04,601
Don't forget

715
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,160
The blood on you is mine

716
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:09,361
Is it

717
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,160
You don't listen to rumors

718
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,720
Confessed that my mother had an affair with someone

719
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:16,640
Maybe

720
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,561
I'm a bastard, too

721
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,281
After the death of Zheng

722
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:25,240
I once regretted it

723
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,601
It was too rash at first

724
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,640
I sent people everywhere looking for you

725
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,361
I searched all over the country

726
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:32,841
You hate me

727
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:34,561
I don't blame you

728
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,680
You have been very intelligent since you were a child

729
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:41,640
Has always been my father's favorite child

730
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:44,400
If it weren't for hindering etiquette

731
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,680
You should have been the son of my Han Wangfu

732
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:23,920
Pay tribute

733
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:29,920
If you don't want to go back with me,

734
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,281
I don't force it either

735
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,121
I hope one day

736
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,041
Can you call me Father yourself

737
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,801
Go ahead

738
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:54,720
I have something to interrogate alone

739
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,801
What I promised you has been done

740
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:06,841
What about what you promised me

741
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,200
Your younger siblings who were kicked out by your stepmother

742
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:19,081
I have asked someone to find it

743
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:21,361
And foster care in a family

744
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,001
They will grow up healthy and safe

745
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,480
As for the wolf-hearted man and woman

746
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,200
Will accompany you on the road naturally

747
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:37,321
I'm relieved

748
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,361
One more thing I don't understand

749
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:42,561
Say

750
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:45,920
You used me

751
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,801
Design and frame Hanwang

752
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:51,680
What is the intention?

753
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:54,440
Nature is

754
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,801
Back to my beloved father
