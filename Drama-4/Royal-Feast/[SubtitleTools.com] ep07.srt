1
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,239
Some people fish the village and oppress the people

2
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,839
A name will be erased from the official record

3
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:57,239
His head will be hung high in the firewood market

4
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,839
I reuse these people

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,519
Is to let every official

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,519
Hanging in the heart day and night

7
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,119
Always remember to be honest and be an official

8
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,559
Be kind to the people

9
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,240
Grandpa Emperor

10
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,000
Criminal law can naturally deter officials

11
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,080
But those are weak women

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Zhanji

13
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,360
How many years have I succeeded to the throne

14
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,320
Always introspect from time to time

15
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,679
I just hope that one day

16
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,399
Wherever I subdue the people

17
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:39,039
Can live and work in peace and contentment and share peace

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,199
What I want

19
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,520
It is a real prosperous time

20
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,679
They are my eyes and my ears

21
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:52,119
Patrol the four sides and monitor the world for me

22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,839
The government is so, so is the harem

23
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,399
My harem

24
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,919
I don't know how many other people's eyes and ears

25
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,880
And how many spies from other countries

26
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,039
Such a weak woman

27
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,320
I can't afford it

28
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,479
Your grandpa and grandchildren are worried about you

29
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,839
There are 26 people on trial this time

30
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,759
There will be crazy rumors of good people

31
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,360
Said you tortured a confession

32
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
Involving more than 2,000 people

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,479
Some people even said that you personally supervised the chop

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,759
Bloodstained Forbidden City

35
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,839
Grandchildren don't want to hear anyone

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,880
To tarnish your reputation

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,279
I don't want to hear anyone

38
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,800
Say you are not at all

39
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,000
I am the king of the world and the father of all peoples

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
Twenty years on the throne

41
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,800
Never slack off early and late

42
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,279
Thoughts and thoughts

43
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:46,360
It is nothing more than the cold, warm and hungry of the people

44
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,839
The trivial matters in the palace are also personally supervised and cut

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,119
Am I that idle

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,600
The person who preaches ballads is really the light of rats' eyes

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,360
Stupid

48
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,800
Although it is a rumor,

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,039
But if you let Yu climb and bite again,

50
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,839
I'm afraid more innocent people will be implicated

51
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,119
Grandpa Emperor

52
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,839
Can you look at your grandchildren's points

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,479
Severely punish the first evil

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Release the others

55
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,639
Then

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,520
How to distinguish who is the first evil

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Who are the accomplices

58
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,320
Zhan Ji

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,399
Go back and read your book well and be your fault

60
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,200
In the future, Dechengye will

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,200
To live up to my high hopes for you

62
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
This little thing

63
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,720
It's not your business

64
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,480
Go home

65
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,959
It is the grandson who leaves

66
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,519
My Lord, she confessed

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,519
Who

68
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,720
It's a prince

69
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,559
Dare to slander the prince of the current dynasty

70
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,799
It was the prince who instructed me to kill the emperor

71
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,359
Behind the scenes is the present prince

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,279
Keep people well

73
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,079
I will enter the palace immediately

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Yes

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Empress Zhuang Fei

76
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,239
Empress Zhuang Fei

77
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:04,720
Empress

78
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,839
Help me help me help me

79
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,359
Wait a minute

80
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,160
Here

81
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,279
This is water

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,160
And

83
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,359
This is fried rice

84
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,320
Empress

85
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,279
Fried rice is easy to store

86
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,040
Not easy to break

87
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,119
You put the rest on your body

88
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Don't let anyone find out

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,519
Good

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,880
Hurry up

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,399
Can you tell the Crown Princess for me

92
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,119
You tell her to talk to the emperor

93
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,519
I'm innocent

94
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,079
I was not involved in the rebellion

95
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,320
Empress

96
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,480
On weekdays, you

97
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,559
Be in the same room with Li Zhaoyi and Yu Meiren

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Didn't you find anything unusual

99
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,640
I've always been kind to her

100
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,640
I don't know why she trapped me in injustice

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,399
Think about it carefully

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
She has been angry at every turn in the past two months

103
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,000
It's like a different person

104
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,959
I don't know

105
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,200
I don't understand either

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,640
Zi Jin

107
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
Go, go, go, go

108
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,959
No, don't go

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,799
Wait a minute

110
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,320
Don't leave without me

111
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,920
Empress, we will come again

112
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,040
Quick, quick, quick

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,359
Go

114
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,320
Ziliao, where have you been

115
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,880
The snacks I made were returned as they were

116
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
It's a good reprimand

117
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,079
If I had known this

118
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,519
I won't be on duty for you

119
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,959
You loser

120
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,679
Miss Yao is still going to trouble you this time

121
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Your Highness can't persuade

122
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,479
I know

123
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,280
The more Grandpa Huang values me

124
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,640
The more I don't want people to talk in my ear

125
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,840
If I dissuade you

126
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm afraid it will involve more

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,719
Your Highness

128
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,719
Perfunctory

129
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:58,840
Tell her to redo it

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,320
Yes

131
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,440
Wait

132
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,640
It's done. Let her deliver it in person

133
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,520
Your Highness, are you summoning her

134
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,799
Go quickly

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,520
Yes

136
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,559
There are rules for concubines in the palace according to their grades

137
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,919
Although Yu Meiren has no pet,

138
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,919
It won't be so frugal

139
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,440
Eat so little

140
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,000
This is to become immortal

141
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
Miss Yao

142
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,599
Why are you still wearing this dress?

143
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,679
Change clothes quickly. Change clothes

144
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,039
You're lucky Your Highness summoned you

145
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,679
Go quickly

146
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,159
Go quickly

147
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Purple Azolla

148
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,679
Why are you staring at this

149
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,559
You go quickly

150
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:16,840
Quick, quick, quick

151
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,039
Your Highness, something happened to the East Palace

152
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,919
Miss Yao, slow down

153
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,479
Is it heavy? Let me hold it for you

154
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,679
Watch your step

155
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,559
Let me hold it for you

156
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,119
Miss Yao

157
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,760
Just a moment

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,960
Your Highness Your Highness

159
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,239
People are coming. People are coming

160
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,960
Your Highness has something urgent to talk about later

161
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,640
What is it

162
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,679
What is it

163
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,239
You guys

164
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,559
Hurry and follow it

165
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,440
Go, go, go

166
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,719
Miss Yao

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,239
Why don't you wait here first

168
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,559
Your Highness seems to have something to do

169
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:04,799
Wait a minute

170
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,479
It's father-in-law Yuan

171
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,679
You follow me and light me up

172
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:07,679
Quickly

173
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,119
Follow me. Hurry up. Hurry up

174
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,159
Your Royal Highness Temple can't make it

175
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,440
You get out of here

176
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
Your Highness Your Highness

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,840
Your Highness can't make it

178
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,479
Let go

179
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,200
Or I'll strangle you first

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,719
Your Highness

181
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,960
Your Highness

182
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,640
Let go

183
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,239
Your Royal Highness Your Royal Highness

184
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,760
Your Highness

185
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,039
This is it

186
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,039
Absolutely not

187
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,719
Your Highness

188
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,760
Your Highness

189
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:00,960
Step down

190
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
Back off

191
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,799
You also give me back

192
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,880
Your Highness, what are you doing

193
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,119
Just in time you came

194
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,080
I have a few words to transmit to my father

195
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,960
Bother you to do it for me

196
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,679
For more than twenty years

197
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,400
Father led the army to the north

198
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,799
I have supervised the country four times

199
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,320
Vertical details and minor reasons

200
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,320
Dare not neglect

201
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,960
But my father believes in the rumors of adulterers

202
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,640
East Palace ministers are often imprisoned and don't say

203
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,359
I am even more afraid and treading on thin ice

204
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,000
Now

205
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:45,080
My father believed in Yu's formation of me

206
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,880
This, this, this

207
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,400
This is really unreasonable

208
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,640
People often say that

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,880
Son doesn't say father's fault

210
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,320
I've been holding it back for more than 20 years

211
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,640
I have to say this today

212
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,960
I know my father loves my second brother

213
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,799
Want to make him prince

214
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,679
I can put up with it

215
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,119
I can even make

216
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,159
But I have to say this today

217
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
You help me down first

218
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,239
Jun Haozhi

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,000
Then I will do it

220
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,400
Upward

221
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,080
Then the people follow it

222
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,679
But my father trusts the Royal Guards and the Neihuan

223
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
Yu Xia multi-purpose heavy code

224
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,559
In the long run

225
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,840
There must be more cruel officials in the court

226
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,520
Folk associations will attack the wind

227
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,000
This

228
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,440
This is very wrong

229
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,479
Help me up

230
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:50,719
Don't move

231
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,119
Your Highness, I am today

232
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:54,479
Your Highness

233
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:54,840
I

234
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,799
Don't, Your Highness

235
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,239
Your Highness, what are you doing

236
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:58,960
You also stand down

237
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,400
One more step forward and I'll die for you

238
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,919
No, no, no

239
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,080
Your Highness Your Highness

240
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,440
Think about it carefully

241
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,119
She has been angry at every turn in the past two months

242
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,960
It's like a different person

243
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
I don't know

244
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,119
I don't understand either

245
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,960
Although Yu Meiren has no pet,

246
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
It won't be so frugal

247
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,760
Eat so little

248
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
This is to become immortal

249
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,200
It's wrong. He's wrong

250
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,919
No, your highness, your highness

251
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,599
Your Highness

252
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,280
You

253
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,080
Back off

254
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't come over here

255
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,599
You take a step forward now

256
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,880
I'll die for you to see

257
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm coming

258
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,719
What will my father have to say

259
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,840
I will definitely convey it to Grandpa Huang truthfully

260
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:40,679
You

261
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,359
You, you still come to mad at me at this time

262
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,599
I'm just following my father's instructions

263
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
I didn't mean to annoy you

264
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,640
He he he

265
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,679
He's mad at me

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,200
He did it on purpose. He did it on purpose

267
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,559
Do you want me to die for you now

268
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:56,960
Your Highness

269
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,719
You child

270
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,039
Why are you fooling around like your father

271
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,039
How old are you

272
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
Still like a child

273
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
Dad has something to say. Come down and say it

274
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,680
I won't come down

275
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,119
Come down

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,359
No less

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,400
I-I haven't gone up yet

278
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,640
How can we talk about it

279
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,680
Your Highness

280
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,359
1

281
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,800
II

282
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,400
III

283
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,280
Your Highness

284
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,040
Your Highness Your Highness

285
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,280
Your Highness

286
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Your Highness, are you all right? Are you all right

287
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Love Princess

288
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,920
Scared me to death

289
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
It killed me

290
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,160
Father has nothing to do. I'll go back first

291
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,079
Love Princess

292
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
Your Highness

293
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,239
Since your highness is safe and sound,

294
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,280
My body also retired first

295
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,439
Your Highness, rest early

296
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,839
Your Highness, you scared me to death

297
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,719
You you

298
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,680
How can you thunder and not rain

299
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,439
I'm shouting here

300
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
Can you hear it outside the temple

301
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,920
Back to His Royal Highness the Prince

302
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,520
There was so much noise just now

303
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,760
I heard it naturally

304
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,599
Help me up

305
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,520
I just want the emperor to

306
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,040
I just want my father to hear me

307
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,160
My son is wronged

308
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,079
Tell them

309
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,439
Prepare meals at once

310
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm hungry

311
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes

312
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,680
Your Highness, what does this mean

313
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,079
I'm confused

314
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,920
Your Highness

315
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,599
Go and check Yu's family for me at once

316
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,599
Yes

317
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,160
Yuan Qi

318
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,160
Yuan Qi

319
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,599
Your Highness

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,439
Your Highness

321
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,560
The handmaiden stayed

322
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,040
No retention
