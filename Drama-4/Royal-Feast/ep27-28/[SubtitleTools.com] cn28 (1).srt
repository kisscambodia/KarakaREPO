1
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,839
from today

2
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,639
I am in charge of the imperial meal

3
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,720
Meng Shang food

4
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,519
just do it

5
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,440
Meng Shangshi is personally responsible for the emperor's royal meal

6
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,479
You are always by His Majesty's side

7
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,119
Has anyone entered the slander

8
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,679
Why did you suddenly not let me go to the imperial front for no reason?

9
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,160
adult

10
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,639
Someone was secretly holding the Queen's Token just now

11
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,479
Secretly went to Bei'anmen

12
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
Jin Yiwei's vigilance is better than ever

13
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,759
Did something happen to the palace?

14
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,399
I already know about the food bureau

15
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,479
go first

16
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,839
go

17
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,440
Quickly report to Le'anzhou and tell Hanwang

18
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,679
His Majesty is in critical condition and summons the prince to Beijing

19
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,639
Of course he knows what to do

20
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,440
Yes

21
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,639
adult

22
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,960
The prince has already made virtue of his vassal

23
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,880
Do you want this

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,600
adult

25
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,240
found it

26
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,119
Prince Concubine

27
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,679
Prince Concubine, His Royal Highness said

28
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,839
If the prince and concubines come, they will definitely keep you

29
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,320
bring this too

30
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,679
no need

31
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,480
Inkstone cricket flowers and plants in this house

32
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,239
All entrusted to the prince's concubine

33
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,079
The things in this room, Your Highness, are precious

34
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,839
bad service

35
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,679
Inkstone is my pet

36
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
She saw Yantaiquan when she saw me

37
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,480
Just be

38
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,880
Let's talk about parting

39
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,160
Inkstone

40
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:16,839
here

41
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,040
Much cuter than your master

42
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
grab it

43
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,359
I know

44
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,559
you go down

45
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,440
Your Highness is so sweet

46
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,440
hide so deep

47
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,200
For fear that the world will laugh at him

48
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,320
seems a little different

49
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,160
what's wrong lord

50
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,399
here

51
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,799
Prince is not allowed to enter on business trip

52
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,079
what's going on outside

53
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,640
A palace maid of Yongning Palace steals imperial embroidered screen

54
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm sick of the concubine

55
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
no one is seen

56
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,239
Gong Zhengji is filling the palace with people.

57
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,440
They dare not break into the prince's study

58
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
already sent away

59
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,640
Prince Concubine

60
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,440
The slaves go to the tea room to get tea and snacks

61
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,600
But I remember that I made ten of these lily cakes

62
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,200
There are only nine times left to turn around

63
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,279
The tea is also reduced by half

64
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,160
I don't know which maid was stealing the mouth

65
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,079
really should hit
free at kisskh.me

66
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,920
Such trivial things go to the master to talk about

67
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
you should fight

68
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,559
Lord forgive me

69
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,880
Slave is just not angry for a while

70
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,720
no more words

71
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,919
The little palace maid dares to hide here

72
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,159
Don't hurry up and plead guilty

73
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,239
master

74
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,479
Why don't we invite Miya Masashi's people to come?

75
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,960
What is a little maid to be afraid of?

76
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:54,919
I went to catch her

77
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,039
queen concubine

78
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,840
Many people asked about His Majesty's condition

79
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,039
minister

80
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
The minister can only try to cover up

81
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,320
Even if you can hide it for a while

82
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,760
But it's not a long-term solution.

83
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,919
Before the prince returns to Beijing

84
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
News must not be leaked

85
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,840
But now it's summer

86
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
temperature rise

87
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm afraid

88
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,640
queen concubine

89
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,559
all ready

90
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,559
go

91
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,359
To shut up

92
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,599
Your Majesty is dead

93
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
empress

94
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,479
your way

95
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,320
It can delay the leakage of corpse gas.

96
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
But it's been a long time

97
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,280
There are bound to be doubts

98
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,640
Once the news of His Majesty's death leaks out

99
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,760
This

100
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:16,960
Liu Gonggong

101
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,640
Secretly announced that Yang Shiqi entered the palace

102
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,840
Yes

103
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,000
His Majesty

104
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,280
you want to help me

105
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,039
help your son

106
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,960
anyway

107
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,760
I must wait for him to return safely

108
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
it's true

109
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,840
Your Majesty was fine

110
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,479
how can it be so sudden

111
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,520
You tell me

112
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,760
What happened in Yongning Palace that day

113
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,559
say

114
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,200
you talk, talk

115
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,520
you save me

116
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:26,520
you save me

117
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,400
then tell me the truth

118
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,320
I tell you

119
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,599
I tell you all

120
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,159
His Majesty

121
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,799
Your Majesty Your Majesty

122
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,520
come soon

123
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,799
Imperial doctor quickly announce imperial doctor

124
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,640
His Majesty

125
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,119
Quickly announce the imperial doctor

126
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,080
Your Majesty Your Majesty

127
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,880
How dare you murder your majesty

128
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,239
catch her

129
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,799
Your Majesty Your Majesty

130
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,159
Your Majesty's wine has not touched his lips

131
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,640
how do i poison

132
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,359
Apparently he had a heart attack

133
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,080
The queen wants to kill me

134
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,320
You shouldn't run away if you're not poisoned

135
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,080
she is queen

136
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,719
every word she said

137
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,559
I have no room for argument

138
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,000
why are you hiding here

139
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,280
At that time I took advantage of the chaos to escape

140
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,919
I'm looking for a hiding place

141
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,760
I dare to be here when it's dark
free at kisskh.me


142
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,119
There are few people here

143
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,880
i want to see the prince

144
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,880
He is the future prince

145
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,479
Only he can save me

146
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,320
Only he can save me

147
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,159
I know you won't believe what I say

148
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,039
but i swear to you

149
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,159
I do not

150
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,200
I didn't kill your majesty

151
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,320
I didn't kill your majesty I didn't

152
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,440
Queen's Secret

153
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,520
Must be worried about His Majesty's sudden collapse

154
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:10,960
Clan King Ran

155
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
The imperial concubine reluctantly hides here

156
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,880
Just because the queen doesn't want to hunt down with great fanfare

157
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
avoid disturbing others

158
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,280
help me help me help me

159
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,440
imperial concubine

160
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,599
The maid next to you is probably already

161
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
The emissary to deliver a letter to Nanjing must be on his way

162
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
I just hope that His Royal Highness can return to Beijing as soon as possible

163
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,640
Otherwise, don't talk about your personal life or death

164
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,799
The world is going to be in chaos

165
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,840
you save me

166
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,080
Concubine Concubine Concubine Concubine

167
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,559
you listen

168
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
I asked someone else to bring some clothes

169
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,080
Don't leave the study room

170
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,880
Okay

171
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,440
quick

172
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,840
As expected

173
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,719
Fu Jiang is going to report to Kunning Palace

174
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,960
shut it down

175
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,520
deal with later

176
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,080
Master, do you really want to help Concubine Guo?

177
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
queen concubine

178
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,719
His Majesty suddenly passed away

179
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,440
Guo Guifei is a witness

180
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,200
Your Highness as a Son of Man

181
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,640
deserve to know the truth

182
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,919
But

183
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,400
if he hears

184
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,039
how sad

185
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,479
Are you still worried about Your Highness?

186
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,280
Your Majesty is a rare gentleman

187
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,080
Now suddenly

188
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know how big the storm will be

189
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,560
The Battle of Baihegou

190
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,479
The late emperor once used firearms to inflict heavy damage on the enemy

191
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,959
Now a hundred tigers are dashing with arrows

192
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,560
Hundreds of rockets fired

193
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,719
great power

194
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,640
It's just that I've never heard of it

195
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,560
Can firearms be used in water warfare?

196
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,239
Just put the powder keg on the dragon head and dragon tail

197
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
can swim in water

198
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,959
Then ignite the explosives in the dragon's belly

199
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,719
Can burn enemy ships

200
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,959
But it's a bit cumbersome to implement

201
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,160
Hire craftsmen tomorrow

202
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:34,719
Yes

203
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,079
His Royal Highness Beijing Express

204
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,280
Immediately return to Beijing

205
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,359
There are assassins to protect His Highness

206
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,719
Your Highness

207
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,800
welcome the princess

208
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,160
The princess is here

209
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,119
you're almost done

210
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,959
Why is the princess here?

211
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,680
In the past, this study was filled with the fragrance of books and ink.

212
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
After you come

213
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,359
There is infinite vitality

214
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,319
Ah Jin serves tea to the crown princess

215
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,160
no need

216
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,280
Holy Communion Violation

217
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,640
I want to invite you to go to the Qianqing Palace to say hello

218
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,439
I just found out that you avoid this place everyday

219
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,400
Is it because the people in your palace are not attentive?

220
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,880
make you unhappy

221
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,839
Before your Highness goes out

222
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,959
Don't worry about plants and animals

223
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,839
I often come to the study room to take care of me

224
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,760
Don't be too heartless

225
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,079
I can't believe that you haven't noticed the strangeness in the palace

226
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,760
Or are you hiding something from me?

227
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,800
Except for a lazy inkstone in this study

228
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Three or two crickets

229
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,040
Only the books in this room remain

230
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,920
What's there to hide

231
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes

232
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,760
Really can't hide the princess

233
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,400
The emperor is critically ill

234
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,199
It's a big deal

235
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,640
not to speculate

236
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,119
Yes or no

237
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,359
The Crown Princess went to the Qianqing Palace to find out

238
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,119
don't you dare

239
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,800
Then go to the Tai Hospital and ask Tai Physician Sheng

240
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,319
Congrats to the princess

241
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,000
imperial concubine

242
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,680
If you didn't tremble just now

243
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,839
Who will pay attention to the face of a maid?

244
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,040
Akin

245
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,520
careful

246
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,800
can't stay here

247
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,719
Follow me back to Qingning Palace immediately

248
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,800
never mind

249
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
it's alright it's alright

250
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,439
quick

251
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:09,920
Okay

252
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,839
You two are here to watch

253
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,920
Yes

254
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
Your Majesty is seriously ill and loves Jing

255
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,400
I'll go in alone

256
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,560
you guys just wait outside

257
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,719
Yes

258
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,000
queen

259
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,920
His Royal Highness the King of Han His Royal Highness the King of Han

260
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,439
you go on

261
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,839
queen concubine

262
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,359
There is a serious shortage of grain in Shandong and Huaixu.

263
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,719
Now is the time to urge the summer tax

264
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,920
People are sad

265
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,920
Immediately draft the edict

266
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,000
Summer tax and autumn grain halved

267
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,719
queen concubine

268
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,000
Can you give me some time?

269
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,839
Officials from the Ministry of Housing and the Ministry of Industry

270
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,959
come up with a charter

271
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,079
Wait until they come up with a specific charter

272
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,359
Most of the local people starved to death

273
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,079
how

274
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,160
Mr. Yang disagrees

275
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,160
Or wait for the prince to return

276
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,359
make another edict

277
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,199
Get your pen and paper ready now

278
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,319
Lord Yang is here to draft the edict

279
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,439
After you're done, go

280
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:35,760
queen concubine

281
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,839
King of Han and King of Zhao

282
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,920
There are also several high-ranking officials in the palace.

283
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,040
Isn't the empress of Han Wang far away in the fief?

284
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,599
How did you get the news so soon?

285
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,160
Guests come from afar

286
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,920
don't meet

287
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,160
Violating hospitality

288
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,959
absolutely not

289
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,079
saw the queen

290
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,239
The younger brother heard that something big happened in the palace

291
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,959
I came back day and night

292
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,520
I don't know how the emperor's condition is.

293
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,079
Your Majesty's dragon body is under the care of an imperial physician

294
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,280
two kings
free at kisskh.me


295
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,839
uncalled

296
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,040
How can I leave the fief without authorization

297
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,359
My Emperor Taizu left the ancestral teachings

298
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,520
where the kings live

299
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,199
Return to North Korea without police

300
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,599
If there is a policeman, then

301
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,199
Unrestricted period

302
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,479
An event that will shake the world

303
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,839
How can I just ignore it

304
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,319
Gossip all over the place

305
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,719
Have you ever heard of the Queen's Wife?

306
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,079
what gossip

307
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,479
Queen's Wife

308
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,079
Now it is rumored in the capital that His Majesty is in critical condition

309
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,959
The prince is far away in Nanjing

310
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,560
There is no East Palace to supervise the country in the DPRK

311
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,359
we hurried back

312
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm also afraid that rumors will spread

313
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,280
country will be in turmoil

314
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,719
Yes, the queen concubine

315
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,599
Your Majesty's condition may improve

316
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
Whether to call the prince back to Beijing

317
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,680
Why do we wait for days

318
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,040
I can't see your majesty

319
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:43,199
Yes, how is your Majesty's body?

320
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,839
Your Majesty has just finished taking the medicine

321
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:45,839
sleep now

322
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,839
The two brothers are in trouble

323
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
I must be tired

324
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,520
Why don't you go back and take a break

325
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,760
see you again

326
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,479
Queen's Wife

327
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,599
Look at these boots

328
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,359
The younger brother thinks of the illness of the emperor

329
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,439
really anxious

330
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,239
I can't wait to have wings

331
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,319
Do you have the heart to shut me out?

332
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,800
Yes, Queen's Wife

333
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,479
If you are afraid of so many people entering

334
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,520
disturbed your majesty

335
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,640
you let us both in

336
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,400
glance from afar

337
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
Can we come out?

338
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,239
go back

339
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,680
Queen's Wife

340
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,640
All ministers and workers are important ministers that the imperial brother relies on

341
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,680
You push three and resist four

342
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,439
don't let us meet your majesty

343
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,439
Could it be that there is another secret

344
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm going to see the emperor immediately

345
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,599
If the emperor is safe

346
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,839
The younger brother is willing to be punished

347
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,599
The emperor needs peace of mind

348
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,719
Who dares to quarrel here

349
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,800
Punished by trespassing

350
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,560
How can there be a brother in the world at the door

351
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,199
The reason not to see big brother

352
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,880
you do

353
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,560
Not afraid to spread the word

354
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,839
The world criticizes you for being arbitrary

355
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,160
Divide our brotherhood?

356
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,280
Zhu Gaoxu

357
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:17,640
You are stubborn and unrepentant

358
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,199
Disgusted by Emperor Taizu

359
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,880
If I hadn't pleaded for you

360
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,280
Your spine was broken by the whip

361
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,359
third brother

362
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,479
Queen's Wife

363
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,959
You had an eye disease

364
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,000
If it weren't for the elder sister-in-law to hire a famous doctor for you

365
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,199
I'm afraid you're not here today

366
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,479
It is said that the elder sister is like a mother

367
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,319
When is it your turn to shout in front of me

368
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,040
East Palace is on its way home

369
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,319
You can arrive in Beijing in three to five days.

370
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,719
Even if His Majesty's body is not healed by then

371
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,439
It can also be monitored by the East Palace

372
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,280
You can rest assured

373
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,479
make a fuss here

374
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,760
shocked holy drive

375
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,640
who dare to bear

376
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,839
Meng Shang food

377
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,119
come over

378
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,719
make it clear

379
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,280
How is your majesty's body?

380
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,040
Your Majesty entered half a bowl of soothing medicinal porridge

381
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,760
really stopped

382
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,239
you are lying

383
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,680
King of Han, please respect yourself

384
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,079
Sheng imperial doctor

385
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:58,560
prince

386
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
Your Majesty has been ill for so long

387
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,560
Where's the medical case?

388
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,800
The medical case is here

389
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,199
I love to study medical books

390
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,040
Worrying about His Majesty's Dragon Body

391
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,560
So I borrowed medical records from Tai Hospital.

392
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,040
Why are you guys so tense?

393
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,760
From Renyin in April to Xinsi in this month

394
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,199
Complete medical records

395
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,880
If the two princes are interested

396
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,359
You can take it back and study it slowly

397
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,040
see a visitor out

398
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,239
queen concubine

399
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,520
Prince on his way back to Beijing

400
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,560
Raid by Assassins

401
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,280
what

402
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,359
what happened

403
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,079
Prince has an accident

404
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,359
How did that happen

405
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,280
queen concubine

406
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
frightened phoenix

407
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
still don't see it

408
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:36,760
This

409
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,800
Really His Royal Highness

410
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,199
mother

411
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,000
How could your son be killed at the hands of others?

412
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,400
This corpse is nothing but an assassin

413
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,599
do not worry

414
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,239
everything has me

415
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,439
good boy

416
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,239
Mother knows you'll come back safe and sound

417
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
Your Royal Highness Returns to the Palace

418
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,680
He instructed the minister to bring the body to the temple

419
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,880
In order to deter the mastermind behind the scenes

420
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,719
I also hope the Queen's concubine

421
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,599
What's going on

422
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
I met an assassin on the way back.

423
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,319
It's alright, it's not hurt

424
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,040
Who is the mastermind behind this

425
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,959
check no

426
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,479
I give up the road

427
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,680
Change the route

428
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,839
But the assassins are still chasing

429
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
Then I'll just have to be confused.

430
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,479
Your Highness

431
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Why is my uncle looking at me like that?

432
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,560
Happy

433
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Uncle is too happy to speak

434
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,760
The prince is brave and resourceful

435
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,920
It is the luck of the country

436
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,000
OK

437
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,359
Okay

438
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,239
Prince Xuan's audience

439
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,080
His Majesty

440
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,320
Your Majesty, Your Majesty

441
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,159
big brother

442
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,320

Son is late

445
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,520
Emperor's Will

446
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,760
Lord Yang, declare it

447
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,840
Fengtian carrier

00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,239
Emperor's edict

449
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,280
I inherit my ancestors Hongye with Feide

450
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,080
The king is in the world and the past year

451
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,560
Emperor Taizong of Shangwei Examination

452
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,879
Shanling will always mourn

453
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
The only thing left is that the carving therapy of Qianli in China has not been restored.

454
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,520
Worrying and working at night with sickness

455
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,159
dying

456
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,120
Day and night common sense of the dead and the living

457
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,919
Going to the Holy One and sharing the same grief

458
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,639
Only the people of the zong community must have a monarch

459
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,120
The eldest son, the crown prince, is gifted and kind

460
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,560
Hideaki Takatomo

461
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,760
The great power of the late emperor

462
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,000
Subjects Xianqin their orders

463
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:22,919
be the emperor

464
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,159
to worship the gods

465
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,199
Facilitate the trillions of people

466
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,399
I am coming

467
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,439
The grace has not yet come to the people

468
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,280
I can't bear to have to work again

469
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,000
Shanling system business from frugality

470
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,560
day and month for funeral

471
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,800
Both China and foreign countries will be released on the 27th day

472
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:10,600
summons

473
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,280
during mourning

474
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,800
Princes who are abroad must not leave the country

475
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,879
The generals everywhere are strictly guarding

476
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:19,679
Farce like the King of Han

477
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,679
I don't want to see again

478
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,479
Yes

479
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,159
Emperor

480
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,399
Concubine Jing's grandfather, Zhongwu King Zhang Yu, was the founding official of the country

481
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,399
In those days Fengtian Jingdi

482
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,719
merit first

483
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,520
The father of Concubine Jing, the British public, Zhang Fu, was an important minister of the country.

484
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,080
Bian Yixun's daughter

485
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,360
Grant free from martyrdom

486
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes

487
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,239
Queen Mother Guo's concubine is also the daughter of Xun Jiu

488
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,679
The father gave birth to three sons

489
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:12,800
Reason not to be martyred

490
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,199
Concubine Guo

491
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,800
You should follow your father to the ground

492
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,399
why

493
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:32,600
mother

494
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
please tell my son

495
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,479
Why must martyrdom

496
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,560
you think too much

497
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,800
His Majesty

498
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,520
Your Majesty Your Majesty

499
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,879
His Majesty

500
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,320
come soon

501
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:00,919
His Majesty

502
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,159
The father loves the imperial concubine very much

503
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,399
The honor and disgrace of her life depended on this

504
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,399
unreasonable

505
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,679
How do you know that glass of poisoned wine is for your father?

506
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,679
Her Majesty Guo Guifei is deeply jealous of her mother

507
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,159
The poisonous drink

508
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,520
She gave it to her mother herself

509
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,239
go

510
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,479
The master waits for the prince to officially ascend the throne

511
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,719
It's time to position the concubines of the East Palace

512
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,840
Don't you always think that your stay is not spacious enough?

513
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,239
New palace later

514
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,719
You should be happy

515
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,439
Why are you still unhappy?

516
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,840
you say these palaces

517
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Where did the original owners go?

518
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,439
I went to serve the emperor

519
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
they go

520
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,199
Family has both rewards and seals

521
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,080
It's an honor that others can't envy

522
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:29,040
That

523
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,439
Where is this hurrying to go?

524
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:44,959
I'm in a hurry

525
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:45,840
If you don't tell me, I won't let you

526
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,040
you know who that is

527
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:48,600
That is

528
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
good prince concubine

529
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,000
How dare you take in the concubines who are to be buried

530
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,159
See if I don't go to the Empress and sue her

531
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,719
On weekdays, you are the least timid

532
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,600
what happened today

533
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,520
so arrogant

534
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,840
Good people are all called princes and concubines to teach bad

535
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,080
you get me out of the way

536
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,159
Sister Wu

537
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,639
I beg you

538
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,600
don't tell the secret, okay?

539
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,239
During this time, the princess was busy with the funeral

540
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,159
no time for him

541
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,320
But a big living person is hiding in the Xinuang Pavilion

542
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,520
we come and go

543
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,199
Why can't you see it

544
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,320
It's just that they're all harem concubines

545
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,439
no grudges

546
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,959
Who's going to tell?

547
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:35,479
Prince Concubine said

548
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,840
she goes to intercede

549
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,040
she's thinking

550
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,800
Maybe we can work together

551
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,600
Can you save the life of the concubine?

552
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,120
let go

553
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,080
Sister Wu

554
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:45,840
let her go

555
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,439
How can I know that the noble concubine's today is not yours and mine's tomorrow

556
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,040
I don't care

557
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:57,959
I do not care

558
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:04,679
It's you

559
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,199
please help me

560
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,719
Help me persuade the prince, brother

561
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,479
Don't let my mother die

562
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:13,000
It's all my fault that I treated you badly

563
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,399
sure help me

564
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,919
Help

565
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:16,800
King Wei has been kneeling all day

566
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,639
Help

567
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:18,879
To be buried is the teaching of the ancestors

568
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,719
Ancestor's teaching can not be violated

569
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,439
Besides, this is the Queen's will

570
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,840
Help

571
