Diners have different moods

taste will be different

4
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,480
I think it's because the cooks don't care

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360

It's New Year's Eve

00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,559
The food bureau is really busy

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,839
Negligence is inevitable

11
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,800
If you are not satisfied with Yao girl's craftsmanship

12
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
The slaves will go to Shangshan Supervisor for you

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,599
Pick another cook

Your Highness

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,320
Han Wang, the foreign minister of Qianqing Palace, can't afford to kneel

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,000
The prince can't persuade

17
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,919
I had to kneel with him

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Princess, please come and see

19
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,880

Kneel down like this

25
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,639
Can the body eat it?

26
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes

27
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:54,919
I'm not afraid

00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,960

Your Highness is really brotherly

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,479
Grandpa Huang will be in tears when he sees it

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Make sure all the gas is gone

The medicinal properties of Lingji Palace are hot

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,039
Very easy to phlegm and dyspnea

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,320
I can't take it anymore

00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,679
Highly trusted by His Majesty

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,359
Today he persuaded His Majesty to use less talisman

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
As a result, His Majesty was furious

62
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,200
The two servants who followed the persuasion did not say anything

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,760
And also expelled Mr. Yuan

64
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,839
Your Majesty has been having nightmares recently

65
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,600
The dragon body is not as big as before

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,519
I'm afraid there will be no peace in the palace

67
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,760
command the crowd

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480

84
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,440

85
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,640
You adult

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,799
From now on, you don't have to go to the pharmacy every day to borrow books

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Adult favor

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,640

89
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:06,959

90
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,239

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,959
adults misunderstood

93
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,959
The slave has seen this volume

94
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,720
It's all in my heart, don't look at it again

95
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:19,880
I do not believe

00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,640

What about my longevity noodles?

112
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,160
Today, His Majesty bestowed the ministers Laba noodles

113
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,399
by convention

114
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,640

This is Shang Food Bureau

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Not Guanglu Temple

135
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,119
Not Shang Shan Supervisor

136
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
Meals not provided for guards on duty

137
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,400
be quiet

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,119
The King of Hell is knocking on the door

139
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,479
Why don't you hurry and hide away

140
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,559
You are too long

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,280
do not talk

142
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
It's over if you send it away

143
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,760
you give me an egg

144
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you afraid that he can't rely on you?

145
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,239
When I was a kid on my birthday

146
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,080
That's what my mother did for me

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,679
Then if I have a birthday

148
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,440
you have to do it for me too

149
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,000

words of returning adults

155
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,919
It's for making plum porridge

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Plum can also make porridge

157
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,400
Plum blossom clears heat and promotes body fluid

158
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,599
Can be used for soup and porridge

159
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,119
What other orders do you have, Mr.

160
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,559
Why is everyone in the food bureau

161
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,640
are so afraid of me

162
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,719
I said what happened last time

163
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,119
just a misunderstanding

164
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,320
I sincerely apologize

165
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,679
You adult

166
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,440
You stepped on my plum branch

167
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,799
Come

be careful

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,919
Be careful it's hot

173
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:07,719
tasty

174
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,159
Yuehua hasn't come back yet?

175
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,760
Yuehua

176
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,400

177
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,719
none of you

178
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,280
Prepare Longevity Noodles for Mr. Yu

179
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,520
no no no no no

180
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,000
no

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,479
I was busy preparing laba porridge yesterday

182
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,760
I forgot to tell you

183
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,960
If you come today

184
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,400
try to avoid him

185
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,320
why

186
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,599
since his tenure

187
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,919
Laba Festival will come to the restaurant on this day

188
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,679
one who cooks for him

189
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,000
Death or injury within three months

190
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,000
very evil

191
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,119
Everyone in the Shangshan Supervisor said it.

192
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,719
Laba Festival Tour Hell

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,320
dodge anyway

194
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,000
Then why did you say it now?

195
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,280
how

196
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,359
You wouldn't have prepared meals for him already, would you?

197
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,039
After Laba is the New Year

198
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,359
be careful

199
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,400
i am not afraid of you

200
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,599
not afraid of you

201
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,599
I am the real dragon

202
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,440
grandfather

203
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,320
it's me

204
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,599
Your Majesty is still Imperial Physician Xuan Sheng.

205
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,880
Need not

206
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,239
i am healthy

207
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,760
No need to declare imperial doctor

208
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,760
Need not

209
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,520
grandfather

210
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,239
Today is Laba Festival

211
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,679
child

212
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,799
you have grown up

213
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,119
From now on, this heavy burden will fall on your shoulders

214
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,599
don't worry grandpa

215
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,880
And my father is there

216
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
nothing like me

217
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,960
don't let me down

218
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,719
grandfather

219
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,599
When did your grandson let you down?

220
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,479
do that thing

221
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,919
don't let anyone know

222
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:29,760
do you understand

223
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,799
Yes

224
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,280
go

225
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,159
prince

226
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,479
The lord has something important to report

227
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,719
News from the Prince's Palace

228
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,599
Plum can also make porridge

229
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,359
Plum blossom clears heat and promotes body fluid

230
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,439
Can be used for soup and porridge

231
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,040
emperor

232
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,599
Pepsi Box

233
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,280
Yao girl

234
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
His Royal Highness admiring plums in Qiongyuan

235
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,040
please take a trip

236
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,319
Deliver the food box in person

237
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,319
Yes

238
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,839
Yao girl is here

239
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,760
then you wait here for a while

240
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:41,839
I'm going to inform you

241
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:34,800
Your Highness

242
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,119
You hear that my piano sound can be improved

243
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,920
Your Highness

244
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,439
Your Highness, what do you see?

245
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,280
Wu Cairen forgives his sins

246
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,280
The servant made a mistake

247
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,560
stained your clothes

248
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,000
It's okay, it's okay

249
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,239
I'll go back and get another one.

250
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,040
you rest

251
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,800
I'll be back in a while

252
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,680
Your Highness, the people from the Food Bureau are here

253
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:32,760
Yes

254
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,319
Your maidservant, please go now

255
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,359
Miss Yao, let's go

256
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:11,760
Your Highness

257
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,199
let you wait

258
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
can't you speak

259
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,760
Are you going to freeze to death

260
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,239
make me feel guilty

261
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,520
I tell you

262
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,280
even if you freeze to death

263
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,920
I won't feel bad

264
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,640
Your Highness

265
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,439
the dish is cold

266
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,400
The slaves go back and redo

267
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,319
Don't get angry

268
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,319
it's too cold

269
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,400
Vegetables will be cold

270
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,199
Your Highness, rest your anger

271
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,280
maid, go back

272
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,000
Yao Zijin

273
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,160
Your Highness without orders

274
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,560
The slave is really going back

275
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,319
Okay, then I'll take you out

276
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,160
See if you can still be a slave

277
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,959
to treat the master

278
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:09,800
Your Highness

279
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,760
slave yesterday

280
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,239
He has been officially promoted to the head chef of Shang Food Bureau.

281
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,239
A humble palm meal

282
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
Is it really what you asked for?

283
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Lady Wang

284
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,920
Known for his moral knowledge

285
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,920
The sage wants to recruit a concubine

286
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,640
Concubine Quan even invited her to accompany her

287
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,160
so glorious
Free at kisskh.me


288
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,640
She also politely declined

289
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,280
insist on returning home

290
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,000
Not only did the saint not force her

291
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,079
Still give a lot of money on the day of returning home

292
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,119
Slaves dare not compare themselves to wise men

293
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,839
But His Royal Highness always takes the saint as an example

294
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:47,680
The Holy One is so broad-minded

295
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,040
Your Highness is also a young man

296
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,479
How can you force a maid?

297
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,359
You said the word "heart" with your own mouth

298
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:55,839
Did you forget it all?

299
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,959
how to forget

300
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,319
How dare you forget

301
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,319
I just wish your heart was like mine

302
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,000
will live up to love

303
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
But the heart of the king

304
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,680
do you really know me

305
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,880
Even if the slaves are humble

306
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,239
I dare not give my heart

307
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,439
you stop

308
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,040
Chen Wu

309
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,040
take her back

310
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,319
Yes

311
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,040
to get the twenty rods

312
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,719
Your Highness, your servant is wronged

313
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,280
It's really snowing

314
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,359
How wrong is the slave?

315
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,040
The slave is to vent your anger

316
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,880
forty

317
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,599
forty

318
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,640
show us

319
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
i want to see too i want to see too

320
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:31,920
very nice

321
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,680
That's awesome, yeah

322
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,880
so much

323
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,959
see what dishes

324
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,520
Let me see

325
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,199
Ziping

326
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,560
It's so cold outside

327
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,560
It's freezing

328
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,719
don't you bring an umbrella

329
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I've been told

330
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,880
you are so weak

331
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,079
Why are you still running around?

332
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:55,599
it's okay no problem

333
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,199
much better

334
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,359
What's up

335
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,040
Look at our specialty dish

336
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,079
Just deal with him

337
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,920
Yeah, definitely beat them

338
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,959
what happened to them

339
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
I heard that every New Year's Eve banquet

340
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,680
The Shang Food Bureau and the Shang Shan Supervisor have to compete

341
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,719
winner

342
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,520
Get the right to enter the imperial meal next year

343
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,000
But this year's dishes for the opponent to challenge

344
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,040
She heard it all

345
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,599
strange to say

346
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,359
Supervisor of Shang Shan is trying to surpass Shang Food Bureau

347
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,719
How can you expose your food list?

348
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,479
where did she come from

349
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,079
I'll see what's in the back

350
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,199
It's not that Caozhou suffered.

351
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,400
The peony that arrived in Beijing after the Mid-Autumn Festival

352
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,280
Are they all from Henan?

353
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,400
tell them early

354
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,199
Don't send peonies again this year

355
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
But the florists heard

356
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,520
The empress in the palace is for disaster relief

357
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,239
Even donated his own hairpin jewelry.

358
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,839
I personally picked the best flower seeds and sent them

359
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,000
The palace moved them into the warm cave

360
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,319
It's been a while

361
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,119
How to be grateful for the little help

362
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,520
Makes me feel very sad

363
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,199
when my mother was there

364
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,560
In winter, I am afraid that the heavy snow will overwhelm the houses

365
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,040
When the heat is hot, I worry that the sun will burn the crops

366
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,479
Don't worry when you leave

367
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Thinking about the wives and children of soldiers who died in the fight against the rebellion

368
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,839
Ask the father to give them rewards and pensions

369
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,040
This is the true virtue of women

370
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,160
Now we're in the harem

371
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,280
do my best

372
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,319
Not to betray her kind heart

373
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,479
princess

374
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,839
You imitate Queen Renxiao everywhere

375
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,280
I really take my mother's world as my responsibility.

376
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,800
Concubine Guo, please be careful

377
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,520
If this is the case, spread the word

378
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,800
How do you call yourself a princess

379
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,160
Founding Heroes

380
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,479
You have such an immoral virtue

381
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,199
unscrupulous woman

382
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,560
I'm not afraid of losing the reputation of the Guo family.

383
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,439
The dignified mansion of the Han Dynasty

384
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,920
To be jealous

385
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,800
Dishonorable

386
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,640
how

387
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,199
Are you worthy of talking about women's virtue?

388
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,239
Concubine Zhuang

389
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,479
This Qiongyuan is very windy

390
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
I feel dizzy after enjoying the flowers for a while

391
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,400
Pardon my apologies

392
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,239
one step ahead

393
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,160
Second sister-in-law, don't care about her

394
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,479
She's a notorious scumbag

395
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,359
it's important that you take care of yourself

396
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,000
After all, this peony is not a festival thing

397
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,640
It's not good in the warm house

398
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,319
I see that the plum blossoms in front of me are blooming very well

399
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,880
let's go see

400
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,839
Concubine Guo is too domineering

401
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,839
Father is always humble and kind

402
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,520
How could she be so lawless

403
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,239
Concubine Guo is his father's favorite concubine

404
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,479
also our elders

405
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,400
How can the younger generation discuss the gains and losses of the elders?

406
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,839
Look at this little talk

407
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,239
I'm so pissed

408
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:52,959
Wu Cairen

409
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,119
This is the holy year

410
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,479
Specially prepared for the queen

411
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,400
What about the best peony?

412
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,400
Miao Xian

413
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:07,959
I'm coming

414
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:11,599
let's go

415
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,119
The fish you sent

416
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,160
fish scales dull

417
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,079
The scales have fallen off

418
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,079
And this shrimp

419
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,479
Shrimp heads and tails have loosened

420
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,719
Shrimp shells are black

421
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,880
And it feels smooth and sticky

422
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,880
It's not like you said you just died

423
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,079
these foods

424
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,000
You dare to send it to the palace

425
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,920
how did you check

426
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,000
Si Shan relieves his anger

427
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,880
Today, His Majesty bestows a banquet on the ministers

428
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,400
Guanglu Temple is busy up and down

429
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,680
Perhaps it was a momentary negligence

430
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,800
Let's talk about this fish and shrimp delivery

431
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,839
Long Trip

432
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,680
Inevitably

433
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,280
Food is to be eaten

434
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,319
The taste can be masked by heavy oil and heavy salt

435
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,719
But is the food fresh?

436
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,239
How is the quality

437
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,839
can you deceive yourself

438
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,560
with this stale food

439
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:18,239
Not only will it damage the body of the eater

440
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,640
It will also destroy the conscience of the cook

441
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,680
Heart is corrupted

442
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,680
What qualifications do you have?

443
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,680
Return all these ingredients to me

444
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,160
Yes

445
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,119
move quickly

446
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:49,920
Meng Shang food

447
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,560
The ingredients used in the palace are all carefully selected

448
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,560
Such a mistake happened today

449
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,199
It is nothing more than the fact that Guanglu Temple favors Supervisor Shangshan

450
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,319
deliberately let us lose

451
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,400
It's okay to make things difficult on weekdays

452
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,640
Now that he has used such a despicable method

453
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,880
move them all up

454
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:18,719
Adult Hideaki

455
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,959
I have plans

456
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,839
These are the ingredients I have stocked up in advance

457
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,040
Check it out, don't go wrong

458
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,119
Yes

459
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,520
go up and bite

460
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,880
bite it

461
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,160
bite bite bite

462
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,640
bite

463
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,160
Go on, touch its eyes

464
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,880
bite it

465
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
yes yes yes you throw it

you bite it

467
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
Bite it, get on it, get on it

468
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:14,800
bite it

469
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,719
yes

470
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,800
bite it

471
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,400
Kaijou

472
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,119
bite

473
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,640
bite it

474
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,640
good right right

475
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,560
That's it

476
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,719
bite, bite

477
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,000
bite it

478
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,599
bite it

479
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:30,239
Your Highness

480
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,280
don't you want to watch a cockfight?

481
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,199
up up up

482
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:35,599
everything is ready

483
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,520
one big one small

484
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,079
Which do you think will win?

485
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:40,959
small

486
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:41,719
small

487
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,199
Then this time

488
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,000
The slave dared to gamble with His Royal Highness

489
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,439
I think big wins

490
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,359
You take your men to receive the twenty rods

491
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,560
Your Highness

492
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,599
yes yes bite it

493
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,839
unsatisfactory thing

494
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:58,760
just bite

495
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,199
up up up

496
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,239
go on

497
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,160
good bite

498
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,400
I lost my money and wasted my money

499
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,079
I lost my money and wasted my money

500
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,880
small wins

501
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:42,959
Su girl

502
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,479
Su girl

503
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,760
what's the matter with you

504
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,679
Sir Siqing asked me to send me a new food list

505
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,919
Meng Shangshi personally checked this food list

506
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,239
just add six more dishes

507
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,199
I don't know what's wrong

508
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,919
no

509
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,959
we'll get it done

510
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,080
Ojizen

511
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:21,479
you see

512
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,879
But here it can be made thinner

513
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:30,679
Okay

514
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,199
Su girl

515
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,199
Shangshan Supervisor adjusted the food list

516
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,719
The first one is still a double shot

517
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,679
Then we still use green onions to burn sea cucumbers

518
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,120
last course

519
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,439
It is the three things of Fushouquan

520
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:06,199
Fu Shou Quan Three Events brings together abalone and sea cucumber

521
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,639
Fish lips and other ingredients

522
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,800
Three things about Fushouquan with authentic taste

523
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,679
It takes about ten hours to boil the thick soup

524
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,040
People just come prepared

525
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,399
I want to discredit the Shangshi Bureau

526
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,679
Unprepared

527
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:19,760
Shang Food Bureau is disgraced

528
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,959
what coke do you have

529
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,000
The order of serving is also important

530
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,679
Three things about Fushouquan once eaten

531
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,239
The next dishes are tasteless

532
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,719
last course

533
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,000
Originally Zijin

534
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,679
Don't waste time

535
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,479
Let's get started

536
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,000
Yes

537
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,639
adult

538
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,000
come with me

539
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,080
adult

540
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,040
New Year's Eve banquet in Qianqing Palace tonight

541
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,000
The humble office bears the responsibility of guarding the palace

542
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,560
Don't dare to leave the office easily

543
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,560
The security guards of the palace are temporarily handed over to Liu Yanshi

544
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,639
You and I have other business

545
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:20,719
let's go

546
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,560
Let Grandpa Huang drink less wine tonight

547
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,239
emperor

548
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,040
Your Royal Highness advises you to drink less

549
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,919
Why don't you eat it

550
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,639
Hidden set

551
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,199
Hidden set

552
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,439
The scallion grilled sea cucumber

553
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,040
His Majesty just glanced at

554
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,560
never touched again

555
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,080
I said earlier that this year's sea cucumbers are not in good condition

556
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,959
I want you to change ginseng

557
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:57,719
you don't listen

558
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,159
The second-class ingredients are naturally inferior in taste

559
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,840
Where can you get sea cucumber from black ginseng?

560
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,479
Is Meng Shangshi very angry?

561
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,360
go explore

562
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,040
Yes

563
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,040
quick

564
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Then prepare for the next

565
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,080
let's go

566
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,719
A pot of umami

567
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,360
Can you hold back the three things of Fushouquan?

568
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:29,600
Steamed sea cucumber and fish maw are hard to resist

569
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,199
Thick soup that has been boiled for more than ten hours

570
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,600
What's more, it's too late now

571
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:36,719
That

572
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,760
what about mutton?

573
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:41,719
That doesn't work either, that doesn't work either

574
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,520
Is that so

575
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,000
Losing the game

576
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:45,320
let me think again

577
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,800
Zijin

578
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
what are you looking for

579
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,800
it's interesting

580
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,760
