1
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
The same food

2
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,479
Diners have different moods

3
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,680
The taste will be different

4
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,360
I think it's the cook who doesn't pay attention

5
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,240
How can I, Your Highness

6
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,079
How dare she

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,519
Your Highness

8
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,560
The New Year's Eve banquet is coming soon

9
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,439
Shangshi Bureau is really busy

10
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,719
It is inevitable that there will be negligence

11
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,680
If you are not satisfied with Miss Yao's craftsmanship,

12
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,640
Handmaiden will go to Shangshan Supervisor for you

13
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,479
Pick another kitchen

14
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,400
Your Highness

15
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,200
Hanwang can't afford to kneel in Ganqing Palace

16
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
The prince can't persuade

17
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,799
Had to kneel with him

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Crown Princess, please go and have a look

19
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,760
Can you persuade it back if you persuade it

20
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,240
Then what do you say

21
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:04,999
Do what you have to do

22
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:25,999
Second uncle

23
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,919
You've been on your knees for more than two hours

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,359
Kneel down like this again

25
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,519
Can your body eat well

26
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,880
Yeah

27
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:32,799
I'm not afraid

28
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,840
When marching and fighting,

29
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,760
I can go three days and three nights without eating

30
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,159
Second uncle

31
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,159
Are you all right

32
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,639
You

33
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Bearer

34
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,040
Second uncle knelt down for a long time and fainted

35
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,519
Hurry to Tai Hospital

36
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:46,760
You

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,240
Quickly

38
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,079
You

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,359
You, you, you

40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,359
Dad, it's your turn

41
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,279
I didn't

42
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,359
Do it yourself

43
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,279
Dad

44
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,480
His Royal Highness the Prince

45
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,719
Your Highness is really brotherly

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,359
Grandpa Huang will be in tears when he sees it

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,240
Make sure all the gas is gone

48
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,719
Your Majesty

49
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,120
Your Majesty

50
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,639
How hot is the medicine of Lingji Palace

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,919
It is easy to stagnate phlegm and reverse qi

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,200
I really can't take it anymore

53
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:26,999
Fuck off

54
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:58,880
Meng Shang Shi

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,080
Meng Shang Shi

56
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:01,839
Go on

57
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:07,880
Meng Shang Shi

58
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,920
Yuan Shaoqing's Technique of Refining Faces

59
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,559
Be highly trusted by Your Majesty

60
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,239
Today he persuaded His Majesty to use less Fu medicine

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,480
As a result, Your Majesty was furious with thunder

62
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,080
The staff of two attendants who followed the persuasion did not say

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,640
But also drove out Lord Yuan

64
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,719
Your Majesty has had many nightmares recently

65
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,480
The dragon body is not as good as before

66
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,399
I'm afraid there will be no peace in the palace

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,640
Command the people

68
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Be careful with your errands

69
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,600
Yes

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
Therefore, those who are good at nurturing nature

71
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,760
Eat first

72
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Don't eat enough

73
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,040
Drink first with thirst

74
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,520
Don't drink too much

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,399
Have a few appetites

76
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,239
Don't want to dwell on it

77
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,959
Yam noodle

78
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,360
Make up for deficiency

79
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,279
Benefiting vitality

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
Six catties of white flour

81
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,040
Ten white chickens

82
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,719
Ginger juice

83
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,880
Ginger juice

84
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,320
What are you thinking

85
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,520
Lord You

86
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,679
In the future, you don't have to borrow it from the pharmacy department every day

87
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Good intentions of adults

88
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,520
The handmaiden's heart is appreciated

89
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,839
How

90
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,119
As long as a book passes by my hand,

91
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,159
Do you feel dirty

92
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,839
My Lord misunderstood

93
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,839
Handmaiden has read this volume

94
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,600
It's all in mind. Don't look at it again

95
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,760
I don't believe it

96
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,520
Jujube and ginger soup

97
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,439
Diet with spleen and stomach

98
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,480
Decoction for Breaking Qi

99
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,040
Treat Yuan Zang weakness

100
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,439
Abdominal pain, chest and diaphragm tightness

101
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:17,760
Cinnamon sinking pulp

102
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,600
Removing dampness and drinking by drinking

103
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
Promoting salivation to quench thirst

104
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,719
Adults walk slowly

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,279
Not to deliver

106
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,040
Important kitchens

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,279
If you have nothing else,

108
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Please don't trespass

109
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,119
Today is Laba

110
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,399
It's also my birthday

111
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,839
Where are my longevity noodles

112
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,040
Today, Your Majesty gives Laba noodles to his ministers

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,279
By convention

114
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,520
It was prepared by Guanglu Temple

115
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,719
I don't want Laba noodles

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,920
It's my longevity noodles

117
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,679
Is it delicious

118
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,999
Delicious

119
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,200
Mother

120
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
You take a bite, too

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,119
Niang doesn't eat

122
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:02,920
You eat quickly

123
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,039
Looks like the craftsmanship is not very good

124
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,039
Zi Jin

125
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:35,919
What are you doing

126
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,880
Zi Jin

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
Don't listen to his nonsense

128
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,239
I haven't done anything bad lately

129
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,679
What he did was all slander

130
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Misunderstood

131
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,640
Today is the birthday of Lord You

132
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,960
He only ordered a bowl of longevity noodles

133
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,479
This is Shangshi Bureau

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Not Guanglu Temple

135
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,999
Nor is it a food supervisor

136
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,280
No meals for the guards on duty

137
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:57,280
Keep your voice down

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,999
The King of Hell came to knock at the door

139
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,359
Why don't you hurry and hide far away

140
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,439
You don't think your life is long

141
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,160
Stop it

142
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
If you send it away, it will be over

143
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,640
You also lay an egg

144
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,880
You're afraid he can't rely on you

145
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,119
When I was a child, when I celebrated my birthday,

146
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,960
That's how my mother made it for me

147
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,559
After that, if I have a birthday,

148
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,320
You have to do the same for me

149
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,880
I'll lay two eggs for you then

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,799
How is it

151
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,280
Almost

152
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,439
Everybody hurry up

153
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,359
Is this wintersweet for setting dishes

154
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,559
The words of returning adults

155
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,799
It is used to cook plum blossom porridge

156
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Plum blossoms can also cook porridge

157
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:25,280
Plum blossom clears heat and promotes fluid production

158
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,479
It can be used to cook soup and stew porridge

159
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,999
What else do you want, Lord You

160
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,439
How come everyone in the food bureau is still

161
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:35,520
Are so afraid of me

162
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,599
I told you about last time

163
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,999
It's just a misunderstanding

164
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
I have come to apologize with all my heart

165
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,559
Lord You

166
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,320
You stepped on my plum branch

167
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,679
Come

168
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,520
Come here

169
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,119
To

170
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,119
Get me one

171
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,840
Be careful to burn

172
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,799
Be careful to burn it

173
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:45,599
Delicious

174
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,039
Haven't Yuehua come back yet

175
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,640
Moon flower

176
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,280
That's right

177
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,599
None of you

178
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,160
Prepare longevity noodles for adults you

179
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,400
No, no, no, no

180
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,880
No

181
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,359
I was busy preparing Laba porridge yesterday

182
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,640
I forgot to tell you

183
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,840
If Lord You comes today,

184
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,280
Do try to avoid him

185
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,200
Why

186
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,479
Since he took office,

187
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,799
Laba Festival will come here on this day

188
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,559
Who can cook for him

189
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,880
Either dead or injured within three months

190
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Be very evil

191
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,999
Shang Shanjian, everyone says it

192
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,599
Laba Festival travels to the door of Yan Wang

193
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,200
Stay away no matter what

194
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,880
Then why do you say it now

195
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,160
How

196
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,239
You can't have prepared meals for him, can you

197
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:45,919
After Laba is the year

198
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,239
Be careful

199
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,280
I am not afraid of you

200
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,479
Not afraid of you

201
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,479
I am the real dragon emperor

202
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,320
Grandpa Emperor

203
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,200
It's me

204
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,479
Your Majesty, is it better to be a doctor in Xuansheng

205
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,760
No need

206
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,119
I am very healthy

207
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,640
Don't use Xuan Tai Yi

208
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,640
No need

209
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,400
Grandpa Emperor

210
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,119
Today is Laba Festival

211
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,559
Children

212
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,679
You're growing up

213
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,999
This heavy burden will fall on your shoulders in the future

214
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,479
Grandpa Huang can rest assured

215
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,760
And my father is here

216
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
It's nothing like me

217
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,840
Don't let me down

218
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,599
Grandpa Emperor

219
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,479
When have grandchildren ever let you down

220
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,359
Go and do that thing

221
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,799
Don't let anyone know

222
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:07,640
Get it

223
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,679
Yes

224
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:09,160
Go ahead

225
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,039
Sovereign

226
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,359
The prince has something important to report

227
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,599
The news from the royal palace

228
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,479
Plum blossoms can also cook porridge

229
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,239
Plum blossom clears heat and promotes fluid production

230
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,319
It can be used to cook soup and stew porridge

231
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:07,920
Emperor

232
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,479
Pepsi Daji Box

233
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,160
Miss Yao

234
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,640
Your Highness enjoys plum blossoms in Qiongyuan

235
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:40,920
Would you please make a run

236
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,199
Send the food box in person

237
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,199
Yes

238
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,719
Miss Yao is here

239
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,640
Then you wait here for a while

240
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:19,719
I'll inform you

241
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,681
Your Highness

242
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you think my piano sound is refined

243
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:23,801
Your Highness

244
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,320
Your Highness, what are you looking at

245
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,161
Wu Cairen forgives sins

246
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:44,161
Handmaiden made a momentary mistake

247
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,441
It has stained your clothes

248
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,881
Might as well do something

249
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:48,120
I'll just go back and change it

250
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:49,921
You rest

251
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:50,681
I'll be back in a minute

252
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,561
Your Highness, the men from the food bureau are here

253
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,641
Is it

254
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,200
Your Highness, the handmaiden will invite it now

255
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,240
Miss Yao, let's go

256
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,641
Your Highness

257
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:56,080
If you are told to wait, you will wait

258
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:57,681
Can't you talk

259
00:22:58,521 --> 00:22:59,641
Are you going to freeze to death

260
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,120
To make me feel guilty

261
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:02,401
I'm telling you

262
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,161
Even if you freeze to death

263
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:05,801
I won't feel bad either

264
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:19,521
Your Highness

265
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:21,320
The food is getting cold

266
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,281
Handmaiden takes it back and redoes it

267
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,200
Don't be angry

268
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:26,200
It's too cold

269
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:27,281
The food will be cold

270
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,080
Your Highness, calm down

271
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,161
Handmaiden will go back now

272
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:30,881
Yao Ziliao

273
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,041
Without your highness's orders

274
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,441
The handmaiden is really going back

275
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,200
OK, then I'll beg you

276
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,041
See if you can still act like a handmaiden

277
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:41,840
To treat the master

278
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,681
Your Highness

279
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,641
Handmaiden yesterday

280
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Has been officially promoted to the palm meal of the Shang Food Bureau

281
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:59,120
A palm meal of low grade

282
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:00,681
Do you really want it?

283
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:02,801
Wang, the female official of that year

284
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,801
Famous for his moral knowledge

285
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,801
The holy man wants to be recruited as a concubine

286
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,521
Quan Fei even invited her to accompany her

287
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,041
So glorious

288
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,521
She also declined politely

289
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:15,161
Insist on going out of the palace and returning home

290
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,881
Far from forcing her

291
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:19,960
He also gave a lot of money on the day of returning home

292
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,000
Slaves dare not compare themselves to sages

293
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:26,720
But your highness has always followed the example of the Holy One

294
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,561
The Holy One is so broad-minded

295
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,921
Your Highness is also shine on you

296
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,360
How can you force a palace maid

297
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,240
You said the word "Xinyue" yourself

298
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
Have you forgotten all about it

299
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,840
How can I forget

300
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,200
How dare you forget

301
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:49,200
I only wish your heart were like mine

302
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:50,881
I will not live up to my lovesickness

303
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:53,881
But your heart

304
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:55,561
Do you really know my heart

305
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,761
Even though the handmaiden's status is humble,

306
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:02,120
I dare not pay my heart

307
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:14,320
You stop

308
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,921
Chen Wu

309
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:29,921
Send her back in person

310
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:31,200
Yes

311
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:58,921
Go and get twenty sticks

312
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,600
Your Highness, the handmaiden is wronged

313
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,161
It's really snowing so hard

314
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,240
How unjust the handmaiden is

315
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,921
Is the handmaiden to take it out on you

316
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,761
Forty

317
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,480
Forty

318
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,521
Show us quickly

319
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:13,881
I want to see it, too. I want to see it, too

320
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,801
How nice

321
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,561
It's awesome. Yeah

322
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:17,761
So many

323
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:19,840
See what dishes are available

324
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:21,401
Let me see

325
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,080
Purple Azolla

326
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:28,441
It's so cold outside

327
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:30,441
Why are they all freezing through

328
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:31,600
Didn't you bring an umbrella

329
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,801
I said I'd go

330
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,761
You're so weak

331
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:37,960
Why are you still running around

332
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,480
Nothing, nothing

333
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,080
Much better

334
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:45,240
What's the matter

335
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,921
Would you like to see our specialty

336
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:49,960
Just in response to his this

337
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,801
Yes, I'm sure I can beat them

338
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:53,840
What happened to them

339
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:55,801
I heard that at the New Year's Eve banquet every year,

340
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,561
The food bureau and the food supervisor have to compete

341
00:26:58,881 --> 00:26:59,600
Winners

342
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:01,401
You can get the right to enter imperial food next year

343
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,881
But this year's other side's dishes

344
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,921
She actually found out all about it

345
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,480
Strange to say

346
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,240
Shangshanjian is holding back more energy than Shangshanju

347
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,600
How can you expose your food list

348
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,360
Where did she come from

349
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,960
I'll see what's in the back

350
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:35,080
Not that Cao Zhou is in trouble

351
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,281
This peony arriving in Beijing after Mid-Autumn Festival

352
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:39,161
Are they all grown in Henan

353
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:41,281
I told them

354
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:43,080
Don't send peony seeds this year

355
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:44,921
But the flower farmers heard that

356
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,401
The empress in the palace is for disaster relief

357
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:49,120
I even donated my own hairpin jewelry

358
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,720
I personally picked out the best flower seeds and sent them

359
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,881
The palace moved them into a warm cave

360
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,200
It has been raised for quite a while

361
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
How can little help be worthy of gratitude

362
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,401
It makes me feel very sad in my heart

363
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,080
When the mother was there,

364
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:15,441
In winter, I am afraid that heavy snow will crush private houses

365
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,921
In the heat, I was worried that the scorching sun burned the crops

366
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:22,360
I still don't feel at ease when I leave

367
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:25,561
Thinking about the wives and children of the soldiers killed in the counter-insurgency

368
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,720
I told my father to give them awards and pensions

369
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:31,921
This is the true virtue of women

370
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:34,041
Now we are in the harem

371
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:36,161
Can do your part

372
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:39,200
It didn't live up to her kindness

373
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:44,360
Crown Princess

374
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
You emulate Empress Ren Xiao everywhere

375
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:50,161
It's really my duty to take the mother instrument as my duty

376
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,681
Guo Bianfei, please be careful

377
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,401
If such words are spread out,

378
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,681
How do you call the Crown Princess to live by herself

379
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,041
Founding hero family

380
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,360
There is such a nun virtue as you

381
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,080
An unscrupulous woman

382
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:06,441
I am not afraid of losing the reputation of the Guo family

383
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,320
Tang Tang Han Wang Fu

384
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,801
In order to be jealous,

385
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,681
Make no sense of honor or inferiority

386
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,521
How

387
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,080
Do you deserve to talk about women's virtue

388
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,120
Empress Zhuang Fei

389
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
This Qiongyuan is windy

390
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,441
I felt dizzy after enjoying the flowers for a while

391
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,281
Forgive me for being rude

392
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,120
One step ahead

393
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,041
Sister-in-law, don't dispute with her

394
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,360
She is a notoriously asshole

395
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,240
It is important that you take good care of yourself

396
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:49,881
After all, this peony is not a festival

397
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,521
It can't be raised well in the warm pavilion

398
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:56,200
I think the plum blossoms in front are blooming very well

399
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,761
Come on, let's go and have a look

400
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:14,720
Guo Bianfei is too domineering

401
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:16,720
My father has always been humble and benevolent

402
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,401
How can you make her so lawless

403
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,120
Guo Bianfei is his father's favorite princess

404
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,360
They are also our elders

405
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,281
How can the younger generation talk about the gains and losses of the elders

406
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,720
Look at this little story

407
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,120
It's really angry. I'm also angry

408
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,840
Wu Cairen

409
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
This is the holy year

410
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,360
Specially prepared for the Empress

411
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,281
What about the best peony

412
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,281
Miao Xian

413
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,840
Coming, coming

414
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,480
Let's go

415
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:11,000
These fish you sent

416
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,041
Fish scales are dull

417
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:14,960
The scales have fallen off

418
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:16,960
And this shrimp

419
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,360
Shrimp heads and tails have fallen loose

420
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:20,600
Shrimp shell is black

421
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,761
And it feels slippery and sticky

422
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,761
It's not like you said you just died.

423
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:27,960
These ingredients

424
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:29,881
Don't you dare send it to the palace

425
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,801
How exactly did you check it

426
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,881
Serve meals to calm one's anger

427
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,761
Today, Your Majesty gives a banquet to his ministers

428
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,281
Guanglu Temple is busy up and down

429
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:38,561
Maybe it was a momentary negligence

430
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,681
Besides, this fish and shrimp transportation

431
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:41,720
It's a long way

432
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:43,561
Inevitable

433
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:45,161
Food is to be imported

434
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
The taste can be covered with heavy oil and heavy salt

435
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
But are the ingredients fresh

436
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,120
What is the appearance of the product

437
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,720
Can you fool yourself

438
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,441
With this stale ingredient

439
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,120
Not only will it damage the body of diners

440
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:04,521
It will even ruin the conscience of the diner

441
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,561
My heart has rotted

442
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,561
What qualifications do you have to make meals

443
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:11,561
Return all these ingredients to me

444
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,041
Yes

445
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,000
Move quickly. Move quickly

446
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,801
Meng Shang Shi

447
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:36,441
All the ingredients used in the palace are carefully selected

448
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,441
There is such a mistake today

449
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,080
It is nothing more than Guanglu Temple favoring Shangshan Supervisor

450
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,200
Deliberately let us lose

451
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,281
Forget all kinds of difficulties on weekdays

452
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,521
Now I can't even use such despicable means

453
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:52,761
Let's all move up

454
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,600
Your Excellency is wise

455
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:02,840
Have a long plan

456
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,720
These ingredients are all stored in advance by me

457
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:09,921
Check well and don't make any more mistakes

458
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:11,000
Yes

459
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:45,401
Go and bite

460
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:46,761
Bite it

461
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,041
Bite bite

462
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:48,521
Bite

463
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,041
Go on, grab its eyes

464
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:50,761
Bite it

465
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,761
Yes, yes, you throw yourself at it

466
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
You bite it

467
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,561
Bite it. Come on, you go up, go up

468
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,681
Bite it

469
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:58,600
Right

470
00:33:59,041 --> 00:33:59,681
Bite it

471
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:00,281
Come on

472
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:01,000
Bite

473
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:02,521
Bite it

474
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,521
Right, right, right

475
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,441
There it goes

476
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,600
Bite and bite

477
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,881
Bite it

478
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,480
Bite it

479
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,120
Your Highness

480
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,161
Don't you want to see cockfighting

481
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:17,080
Up, up, up

482
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,480
It's all ready

483
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,401
One big one and one small one

484
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Which one do you think can win

485
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,840
A small one

486
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,600
Small

487
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:26,080
Then this time

488
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,881
The handmaiden dared to gamble with your highness

489
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
I think the big one can win

490
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,240
You take your men and get twenty sticks

491
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:37,441
Your Highness

492
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,480
Bite it right to right

493
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,720
Something that doesn't live up to expectations

494
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,641
Just bite

495
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,080
Up, up, up

496
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,120
Come on

497
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,041
Good bite

498
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,281
I lost my money in vain

499
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:47,960
I lost my money in vain

500
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,761
The little one wins

501
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,840
Miss Su

502
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:29,360
Miss Su

503
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:33,641
What can I do for you

504
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Lord Siqing asked me to send a new food list

505
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,800
Meng Shangshi personally checked this food list

506
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,120
Just six more courses

507
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:53,080
I wonder what's wrong with it

508
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:55,800
No

509
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:56,840
We'll get it done

510
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,961
Wang Si's meal

511
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,360
You see

512
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,760
But it can be carved thinner down here

513
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,560
Good

514
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,080
Miss Su

515
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:32,080
Shang Shanjian adjusted the food list

516
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,600
The first one is to explode two pieces

517
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:40,560
Then we still burn sea cucumbers with onions

518
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:43,001
The last line

519
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:46,320
It's all three things of happiness and longevity

520
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,080
Fushou Quan's three things bring together abalone and sea cucumber

521
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,520
Fish lips and other ingredients

522
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,681
Three things about happiness and longevity with authentic taste

523
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,560
Soup alone has to be boiled for ten hours

524
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,921
People are prepared at all

525
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,280
I want to disgrace the food bureau

526
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,560
Be caught off guard

527
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,641
The Food Bureau is disgraced

528
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:03,840
What kind of coke do you have

529
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,881
Serving should also pay attention to the order

530
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:08,560
Once you have eaten all three things of longevity,

531
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,120
The dishes in the back are boring

532
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,600
The last line

533
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,881
It was originally Zi Jin

534
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,560
Don't delay the hour

535
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Let's get started, everybody

536
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,881
Yes

537
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:48,520
Your Excellency

538
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:50,881
Come with me

539
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:51,961
Your Excellency

540
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,921
Ganqing Palace has a good banquet on New Year's Eve tonight

541
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,881
The humble position is responsible for guarding the palace

542
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,441
Dare not go AWOL easily

543
00:39:57,961 --> 00:40:00,441
The security guards of the palace will be handed over to Liu Qian for the time being

544
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,520
You and I have other priorities

545
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,600
Let's go

546
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:18,441
Let Grandpa Huang drink less wine tonight

547
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,120
Emperor

548
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:34,921
Your Highness, Emperor Taisun, advises you to drink less

549
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:22,800
Why don't you eat it

550
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:26,520
Recipe canon meal

551
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,080
Recipe canon meal

552
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,320
That fried sea cucumber with green onion

553
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:33,921
Your Majesty only looked at it

554
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:35,441
I never touched it again

555
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:38,961
I said earlier that this year's sea cucumber looks bad

556
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:39,840
I told you to change black ginseng

557
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,600
You won't listen

558
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:43,040
The taste of inferior ingredients is naturally inferior

559
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:44,721
Where can black ginseng match sea cucumber

560
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,360
Is Meng Shangshi very angry

561
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,241
Explore again

562
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:50,921
Yes

563
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:54,921
Quickly

564
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:55,921
Go ahead and prepare the rest

565
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:56,961
Let's go

566
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,600
The delicious taste of a pot

567
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,241
Can you hold down all three things of happiness and longevity

568
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,481
Steamed sea cucumbers and fish maw are hard to hold

569
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:14,080
A thick soup that has been boiled for more than ten hours

570
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,481
What's more, it's too late now

571
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,600
That

572
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:20,641
What about mutton

573
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,600
Neither this nor that

574
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:25,401
Is that all

575
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:26,881
Lose the game helplessly

576
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,201
Let me think again

577
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:50,681
Zi Jin

578
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,201
What exactly are you looking for

579
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:15,681
It's interesting

580
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,641
Don't underestimate this dish

581
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Just this kung fu of removing bones without hurting flesh and blood

582
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:23,481
Just get it

583
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,040
Grandpa Emperor

584
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,201
This pigeon meat is steamed to death

585
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,800
And the soup is very nourishing

586
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,840
You try

587
00:43:57,641 --> 00:43:59,080
Meng Shangshi accepted it

588
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,840
This clear soup cabbage is not really clear soup

589
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,641
There should be something in it

590
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,201
Duck, chicken and ham

591
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,201
As Your Highness said

592
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:33,600
It is a meal specially cooked by Shangshi Bureau for the Prince

593
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:48,161
There is a folk saying

594
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:50,641
No ham is not beautiful, no chicken is not fresh

595
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,120
No duck, no fragrance, no elbow, no thick

596
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:54,040
That's right

597
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,401
Be an expert
