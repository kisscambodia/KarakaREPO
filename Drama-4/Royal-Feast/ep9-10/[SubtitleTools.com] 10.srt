1
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,801
Your Highness

2
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Do you think my piano sound is refined

3
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:40,921
Your Highness

4
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
Your Highness, what are you looking at

5
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,281
Wu Cairen forgives sins

6
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:01,281
Handmaiden made a momentary mistake

7
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,561
It has stained your clothes

8
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,001
Might as well do something

9
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,240
I'll just go back and change it

10
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:07,041
You rest

11
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:07,801
I'll be back in a minute

12
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,681
Your Highness, the men from the food bureau are here

13
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,761
Is it

14
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,320
Your Highness, the handmaiden will invite it now

15
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,360
Miss Yao, let's go

16
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,761
Your Highness

17
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,200
If you are told to wait, you will wait

18
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:14,801
Can't you talk

19
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,761
Are you going to freeze to death

20
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
To make me feel guilty

21
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,521
I'm telling you

22
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,281
Even if you freeze to death

23
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,921
I won't feel bad either

24
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:36,641
Your Highness

25
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:38,440
The food is getting cold

26
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,401
Handmaiden takes it back and redoes it

27
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,320
Don't be angry

28
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:43,320
It's too cold

29
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:44,401
The food will be cold

30
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
Your Highness, calm down

31
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,281
Handmaiden will go back now

32
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:48,001
Yao Ziliao

33
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,161
Without your highness's orders

34
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,561
The handmaiden is really going back

35
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,320
OK, then I'll beg you

36
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,161
See if you can still act like a handmaiden

37
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:58,960
To treat the master

38
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,801
Your Highness

39
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,761
Handmaiden yesterday

40
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Has been officially promoted to the palm meal of the Shang Food Bureau

41
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,240
A palm meal of low grade

42
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:17,801
Do you really want it?

43
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:19,921
Wang, the female official of that year

44
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,921
Famous for his moral knowledge

45
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,921
The holy man wants to be recruited as a concubine

46
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,641
Quan Fei even invited her to accompany her

47
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,161
So glorious

48
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,641
She also declined politely

49
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,281
Insist on going out of the palace and returning home

50
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,001
Far from forcing her

51
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,080
He also gave a lot of money on the day of returning home

52
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,120
Slaves dare not compare themselves to sages

53
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:43,840
But your highness has always followed the example of the Holy One

54
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,681
The Holy One is so broad-minded

55
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:50,041
Your Highness is also shine on you

56
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,480
How can you force a palace maid

57
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,360
You said the word "Xinyue" yourself

58
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,840
Have you forgotten all about it

59
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,960
How can I forget

60
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,320
How dare you forget

61
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:06,320
I only wish your heart were like mine

62
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,001
I will not live up to my lovesickness

63
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,001
But your heart

64
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,681
Do you really know my heart

65
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,881
Even though the handmaiden's status is humble,

66
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:19,240
I dare not pay my heart

67
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:31,440
You stop

68
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,041
Chen Wu

69
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,041
Send her back in person

70
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:48,320
Yes

71
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,041
Go and get twenty sticks

72
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,720
Your Highness, the handmaiden is wronged

73
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,281
It's really snowing so hard

74
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:22,360
How unjust the handmaiden is

75
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,041
Is the handmaiden to take it out on you

76
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,881
Forty

77
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Forty

78
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,641
Show us quickly

79
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,001
I want to see it, too. I want to see it, too

80
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,921
How nice

81
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,681
It's awesome. Yeah

82
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:34,881
So many

83
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:36,960
See what dishes are available

84
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:38,521
Let me see

85
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,200
Purple Azolla

86
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:45,561
It's so cold outside

87
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:47,561
Why are they all freezing through

88
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:48,720
Didn't you bring an umbrella

89
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,921
I said I'd go

90
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:51,881
You're so weak

91
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,080
Why are you still running around

92
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,600
Nothing, nothing

93
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,200
Much better

94
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:02,360
What's the matter

95
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,041
Would you like to see our specialty

96
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,080
Just in response to his this

97
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,921
Yes, I'm sure I can beat them

98
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:10,960
What happened to them

99
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:12,921
I heard that at the New Year's Eve banquet every year,

100
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,681
The food bureau and the food supervisor have to compete

101
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:16,720
Winners

102
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,521
You can get the right to enter imperial food next year

103
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,001
But this year's other side's dishes

104
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,041
She actually found out all about it

105
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,600
Strange to say

106
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,360
Shangshanjian is holding back more energy than Shangshanju

107
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:32,720
How can you expose your food list

108
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,480
Where did she come from

109
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,080
I'll see what's in the back

110
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:52,200
Not that Cao Zhou is in trouble

111
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,401
This peony arriving in Beijing after Mid-Autumn Festival

112
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,281
Are they all grown in Henan

113
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:58,401
I told them

114
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:00,200
Don't send peony seeds this year

115
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,041
But the flower farmers heard that

116
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,521
The empress in the palace is for disaster relief

117
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,240
I even donated my own hairpin jewelry

118
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,840
I personally picked out the best flower seeds and sent them

119
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,001
The palace moved them into a warm cave

120
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
It has been raised for quite a while

121
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
How can little help be worthy of gratitude

122
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,521
It makes me feel very sad in my heart

123
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,200
When the mother was there,

124
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:32,561
In winter, I am afraid that heavy snow will crush private houses

125
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,041
In the heat, I was worried that the scorching sun burned the crops

126
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,480
I still don't feel at ease when I leave

127
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,681
Thinking about the wives and children of the soldiers killed in the counter-insurgency

128
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,840
I told my father to give them awards and pensions

129
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,041
This is the true virtue of women

130
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,161
Now we are in the harem

131
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:53,281
Can do your part

132
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,320
It didn't live up to her kindness

133
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:01,480
Crown Princess

134
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
You emulate Empress Ren Xiao everywhere

135
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:07,281
It's really my duty to take the mother instrument as my duty

136
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:09,801
Guo Bianfei, please be careful

137
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,521
If such words are spread out,

138
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,801
How do you call the Crown Princess to live by herself

139
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,161
Founding hero family

140
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,480
There is such a nun virtue as you

141
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
An unscrupulous woman

142
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:23,561
I am not afraid of losing the reputation of the Guo family

143
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,440
Tang Tang Han Wang Fu

144
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,921
In order to be jealous,

145
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,801
Make no sense of honor or inferiority

146
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,641
How

147
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,200
Do you deserve to talk about women's virtue

148
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,240
Empress Zhuang Fei

149
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
This Qiongyuan is windy

150
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:42,561
I felt dizzy after enjoying the flowers for a while

151
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,401
Forgive me for being rude

152
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,240
One step ahead

153
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,161
Sister-in-law, don't dispute with her

154
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,480
She is a notoriously asshole

155
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:01,360
It is important that you take good care of yourself

156
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:07,001
After all, this peony is not a festival

157
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,641
It can't be raised well in the warm pavilion

158
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:13,320
I think the plum blossoms in front are blooming very well

159
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,881
Come on, let's go and have a look

160
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:31,840
Guo Bianfei is too domineering

161
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,840
My father has always been humble and benevolent

162
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,521
How can you make her so lawless

163
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,240
Guo Bianfei is his father's favorite princess

164
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:39,480
They are also our elders

165
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,401
How can the younger generation talk about the gains and losses of the elders

166
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:48,840
Look at this little story

167
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,240
It's really angry. I'm also angry

168
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,960
Wu Cairen

169
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
This is the holy year

170
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,480
Specially prepared for the Empress

171
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,401
What about the best peony

172
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,401
Miao Xian

173
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,960
Coming, coming

174
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,600
Let's go

175
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:28,120
These fish you sent

176
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:30,161
Fish scales are dull

177
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,080
The scales have fallen off

178
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:34,080
And this shrimp

179
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,480
Shrimp heads and tails have fallen loose

180
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,720
Shrimp shell is black

181
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,881
And it feels slippery and sticky

182
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,881
It's not like you said you just died.

183
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:45,080
These ingredients

184
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,001
Don't you dare send it to the palace

185
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,921
How exactly did you check it

186
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,001
Serve meals to calm one's anger

187
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,881
Today, Your Majesty gives a banquet to his ministers

188
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,401
Guanglu Temple is busy up and down

189
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,681
Maybe it was a momentary negligence

190
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,801
Besides, this fish and shrimp transportation

191
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:58,840
It's a long way

192
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:00,681
Inevitable

193
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,281
Food is to be imported

194
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,320
The taste can be covered with heavy oil and heavy salt

195
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
But are the ingredients fresh

196
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,240
What is the appearance of the product

197
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
Can you fool yourself

198
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,561
With this stale ingredient

199
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,240
Not only will it damage the body of diners

200
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:21,641
It will even ruin the conscience of the diner

201
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,681
My heart has rotted

202
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,681
What qualifications do you have to make meals

203
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:28,681
Return all these ingredients to me

204
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,161
Yes

205
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,120
Move quickly. Move quickly

206
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,921
Meng Shang Shi

207
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:53,561
All the ingredients used in the palace are carefully selected

208
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:55,561
There is such a mistake today

209
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,200
It is nothing more than Guanglu Temple favoring Shangshan Supervisor

210
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
Deliberately let us lose

211
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,401
Forget all kinds of difficulties on weekdays

212
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,641
Now I can't even use such despicable means

213
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:09,881
Let's all move up

214
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,720
Your Excellency is wise

215
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:19,960
Have a long plan

216
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,840
These ingredients are all stored in advance by me

217
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:27,041
Check well and don't make any more mistakes

218
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:28,120
Yes

219
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,521
Go and bite

220
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:03,881
Bite it

221
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:05,161
Bite bite

222
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:05,641
Bite

223
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,161
Go on, grab its eyes

224
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:07,881
Bite it

225
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:08,881
Yes, yes, you throw yourself at it

226
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
You bite it

227
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,681
Bite it. Come on, you go up, go up

228
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,801
Bite it

229
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:15,720
Right

230
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:16,801
Bite it

231
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:17,401
Come on

232
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:18,120
Bite

233
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:19,641
Bite it

234
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,641
Right, right, right

235
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:21,561
There it goes

236
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,720
Bite and bite

237
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,001
Bite it

238
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,600
Bite it

239
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,240
Your Highness

240
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,281
Don't you want to see cockfighting

241
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:34,200
Up, up, up

242
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,600
It's all ready

243
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,521
One big one and one small one

244
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Which one do you think can win

245
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,960
A small one

246
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,720
Small

247
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,200
Then this time

248
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:46,001
The handmaiden dared to gamble with your highness

249
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
I think the big one can win

250
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,360
You take your men and get twenty sticks

251
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:54,561
Your Highness

252
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,600
Bite it right to right

253
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:57,840
Something that doesn't live up to expectations

254
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,761
Just bite

255
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,200
Up, up, up

256
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,240
Come on

257
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,161
Good bite

258
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,401
I lost my money in vain

259
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,080
I lost my money in vain

260
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,881
The little one wins

261
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,960
Miss Su

262
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:46,480
Miss Su

263
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:50,761
What can I do for you

264
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,680
Lord Siqing asked me to send a new food list

265
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,920
Meng Shangshi personally checked this food list

266
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,240
Just six more courses

267
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,200
I wonder what's wrong with it

268
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:12,920
No

269
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:13,960
We'll get it done

270
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,081
Wang Si's meal

271
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,480
You see

272
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,880
But it can be carved thinner down here

273
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,680
Good

274
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,200
Miss Su

275
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,200
Shang Shanjian adjusted the food list

276
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,720
The first one is to explode two pieces

277
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:57,680
Then we still burn sea cucumbers with onions

278
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,121
The last line

279
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,440
It's all three things of happiness and longevity

280
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,200
Fushou Quan's three things bring together abalone and sea cucumber

281
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,640
Fish lips and other ingredients

282
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,801
Three things about happiness and longevity with authentic taste

283
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,680
Soup alone has to be boiled for ten hours

284
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:14,041
People are prepared at all

285
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,400
I want to disgrace the food bureau

286
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
Be caught off guard

287
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,761
The Food Bureau is disgraced

288
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:20,960
What kind of coke do you have

289
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,001
Serving should also pay attention to the order

290
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,680
Once you have eaten all three things of longevity,

291
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,240
The dishes in the back are boring

292
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,720
The last line

293
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,001
It was originally Zi Jin

294
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,680
Don't delay the hour

295
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Let's get started, everybody

296
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,001
Yes

297
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:05,640
Your Excellency

298
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,001
Come with me

299
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:09,081
Your Excellency

300
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,041
Ganqing Palace has a good banquet on New Year's Eve tonight

301
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,001
The humble position is responsible for guarding the palace

302
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,561
Dare not go AWOL easily

303
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:17,561
The security guards of the palace will be handed over to Liu Qian for the time being

304
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,640
You and I have other priorities

305
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,720
Let's go

306
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:35,561
Let Grandpa Huang drink less wine tonight

307
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,240
Emperor

308
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:52,041
Your Highness, Emperor Taisun, advises you to drink less

309
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:39,920
Why don't you eat it

310
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:43,640
Recipe canon meal

311
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,200
Recipe canon meal

312
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:49,440
That fried sea cucumber with green onion

313
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:51,041
Your Majesty only looked at it

314
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:52,561
I never touched it again

315
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:56,081
I said earlier that this year's sea cucumber looks bad

316
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:56,960
I told you to change black ginseng

317
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,720
You won't listen

318
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,160
The taste of inferior ingredients is naturally inferior

319
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,841
Where can black ginseng match sea cucumber

320
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
Is Meng Shangshi very angry

321
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,361
Explore again

322
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,041
Yes

323
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:12,041
Quickly

324
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,041
Go ahead and prepare the rest

325
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,081
Let's go

326
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:20,720
The delicious taste of a pot

327
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,361
Can you hold down all three things of happiness and longevity

328
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,601
Steamed sea cucumbers and fish maw are hard to hold

329
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,200
A thick soup that has been boiled for more than ten hours

330
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,601
What's more, it's too late now

331
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,720
That

332
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:37,761
What about mutton

333
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,720
Neither this nor that

334
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,521
Is that all

335
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:44,001
Lose the game helplessly

336
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,321
Let me think again

337
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:07,801
Zi Jin

338
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:09,321
What exactly are you looking for

339
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,801
It's interesting

340
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,761
Don't underestimate this dish

341
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Just this kung fu of removing bones without hurting flesh and blood

342
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:40,601
Just get it

343
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,160
Grandpa Emperor

344
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:50,321
This pigeon meat is steamed to death

345
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,920
And the soup is very nourishing

346
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,960
You try

347
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,200
Meng Shangshi accepted it

348
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,960
This clear soup cabbage is not really clear soup

349
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,761
There should be something in it

350
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:43,321
Duck, chicken and ham

351
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,321
As Your Highness said

352
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:50,720
It is a meal specially cooked by Shangshi Bureau for the Prince

353
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:05,281
There is a folk saying

354
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,761
No ham is not beautiful, no chicken is not fresh

355
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,240
No duck, no fragrance, no elbow, no thick

356
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,160
That's right

357
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,521
Be an expert
