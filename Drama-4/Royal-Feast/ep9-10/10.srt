241
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,801
Your Highness

242
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,120
Do you think my piano sound is refined

243
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:45,921
Your Highness

244
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,440
Your Highness, what are you looking at

245
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,281
Wu Cairen forgives sins

246
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:06,281
Handmaiden made a momentary mistake

247
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,561
It has stained your clothes

248
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,001
Might as well do something

249
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,240
I'll just go back and change it

250
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,041
You rest

251
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,801
I'll be back in a minute

252
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,681
Your Highness, the men from the food bureau are here

253
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,761
Is it

254
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,320
Your Highness, the handmaiden will invite it now

255
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,360
Miss Yao, let's go

256
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,761
Your Highness

257
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,200
If you are told to wait, you will wait

258
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:19,801
Can't you talk

259
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:21,761
Are you going to freeze to death

260
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,240
To make me feel guilty

261
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:24,521
I'm telling you

262
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,281
Even if you freeze to death

263
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:27,921
I won't feel bad either

264
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:41,641
Your Highness

265
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:43,440
The food is getting cold

266
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,401
Handmaiden takes it back and redoes it

267
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,320
Don't be angry

268
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:48,320
It's too cold

269
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:49,401
The food will be cold

270
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,200
Your Highness, calm down

271
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,281
Handmaiden will go back now

272
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,001
Yao Ziliao

273
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,161
Without your highness's orders

274
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,561
The handmaiden is really going back

275
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
OK, then I'll beg you

276
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,161
See if you can still act like a handmaiden

277
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:03,960
To treat the master

278
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,801
Your Highness

279
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,761
Handmaiden yesterday

280
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Has been officially promoted to the palm meal of the Shang Food Bureau

281
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:21,240
A palm meal of low grade

282
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:22,801
Do you really want it?

283
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:24,921
Wang, the female official of that year

284
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,921
Famous for his moral knowledge

285
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,921
The holy man wants to be recruited as a concubine

286
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,641
Quan Fei even invited her to accompany her

287
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,161
So glorious

288
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,641
She also declined politely

289
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,281
Insist on going out of the palace and returning home

290
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,001
Far from forcing her

291
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,080
He also gave a lot of money on the day of returning home

292
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,120
Slaves dare not compare themselves to sages

293
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,840
But your highness has always followed the example of the Holy One

294
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,681
The Holy One is so broad-minded

295
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,041
Your Highness is also shine on you

296
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,480
How can you force a palace maid

297
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,360
You said the word "Xinyue" yourself

298
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,840
Have you forgotten all about it

299
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,960
How can I forget

300
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,320
How dare you forget

301
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:11,320
I only wish your heart were like mine

302
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:13,001
I will not live up to my lovesickness

303
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,001
But your heart

304
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,681
Do you really know my heart

305
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,881
Even though the handmaiden's status is humble,

306
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:24,240
I dare not pay my heart

307
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:36,440
You stop

308
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,041
Chen Wu

309
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,041
Send her back in person

310
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:53,320
Yes

311
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:21,041
Go and get twenty sticks

312
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,720
Your Highness, the handmaiden is wronged

313
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,281
It's really snowing so hard

314
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,360
How unjust the handmaiden is

315
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,041
Is the handmaiden to take it out on you

316
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,881
Forty

317
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,600
Forty

318
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,641
Show us quickly

319
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,001
I want to see it, too. I want to see it, too

320
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:36,921
How nice

321
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,681
It's awesome. Yeah

322
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:39,881
So many

323
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:41,960
See what dishes are available

324
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:43,521
Let me see

325
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,200
Purple Azolla

326
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:50,561
It's so cold outside

327
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:52,561
Why are they all freezing through

328
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:53,720
Didn't you bring an umbrella

329
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:55,921
I said I'd go

330
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,881
You're so weak

331
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,080
Why are you still running around

332
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,600
Nothing, nothing

333
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,200
Much better

334
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:07,360
What's the matter

335
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,041
Would you like to see our specialty

336
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,080
Just in response to his this

337
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,921
Yes, I'm sure I can beat them

338
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:15,960
What happened to them

339
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:17,921
I heard that at the New Year's Eve banquet every year,

340
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:20,681
The food bureau and the food supervisor have to compete

341
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:21,720
Winners

342
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,521
You can get the right to enter imperial food next year

343
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,001
But this year's other side's dishes

344
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,041
She actually found out all about it

345
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,600
Strange to say

346
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:36,360
Shangshanjian is holding back more energy than Shangshanju

347
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:37,720
How can you expose your food list

348
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
Where did she come from

349
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,080
I'll see what's in the back

350
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,200
Not that Cao Zhou is in trouble

351
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,401
This peony arriving in Beijing after Mid-Autumn Festival

352
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,281
Are they all grown in Henan

353
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:03,401
I told them

354
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:05,200
Don't send peony seeds this year

355
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,041
But the flower farmers heard that

356
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,521
The empress in the palace is for disaster relief

357
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,240
I even donated my own hairpin jewelry

358
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,840
I personally picked out the best flower seeds and sent them

359
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,001
The palace moved them into a warm cave

360
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,320
It has been raised for quite a while

361
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,120
How can little help be worthy of gratitude

362
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,521
It makes me feel very sad in my heart

363
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,200
When the mother was there,

364
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:37,561
In winter, I am afraid that heavy snow will crush private houses

365
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,041
In the heat, I was worried that the scorching sun burned the crops

366
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,480
I still don't feel at ease when I leave

367
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:47,681
Thinking about the wives and children of the soldiers killed in the counter-insurgency

368
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:50,840
I told my father to give them awards and pensions

369
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:54,041
This is the true virtue of women

370
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:56,161
Now we are in the harem

371
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,281
Can do your part

372
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,320
It didn't live up to her kindness

373
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:06,480
Crown Princess

374
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,840
You emulate Empress Ren Xiao everywhere

375
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:12,281
It's really my duty to take the mother instrument as my duty

376
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:14,801
Guo Bianfei, please be careful

377
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,521
If such words are spread out,

378
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,801
How do you call the Crown Princess to live by herself

379
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,161
Founding hero family

380
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,480
There is such a nun virtue as you

381
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,200
An unscrupulous woman

382
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,561
I am not afraid of losing the reputation of the Guo family

383
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,440
Tang Tang Han Wang Fu

384
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,921
In order to be jealous,

385
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,801
Make no sense of honor or inferiority

386
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,641
How

387
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,200
Do you deserve to talk about women's virtue

388
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,240
Empress Zhuang Fei

389
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
This Qiongyuan is windy

390
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,561
I felt dizzy after enjoying the flowers for a while

391
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,401
Forgive me for being rude

392
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,240
One step ahead

393
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,161
Sister-in-law, don't dispute with her

394
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
She is a notoriously asshole

395
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,360
It is important that you take good care of yourself

396
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:12,001
After all, this peony is not a festival

397
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,641
It can't be raised well in the warm pavilion

398
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:18,320
I think the plum blossoms in front are blooming very well

399
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:20,881
Come on, let's go and have a look

400
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,840
Guo Bianfei is too domineering

401
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:38,840
My father has always been humble and benevolent

402
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,521
How can you make her so lawless

403
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,240
Guo Bianfei is his father's favorite princess

404
00:29:43,521 --> 00:29:44,480
They are also our elders

405
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,401
How can the younger generation talk about the gains and losses of the elders

406
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:53,840
Look at this little story

407
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,240
It's really angry. I'm also angry

408
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,960
Wu Cairen

409
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
This is the holy year

410
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,480
Specially prepared for the Empress

411
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,401
What about the best peony

412
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,401
Miao Xian

413
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,960
Coming, coming

414
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,600
Let's go

415
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,120
These fish you sent

416
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:35,161
Fish scales are dull

417
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:37,080
The scales have fallen off

418
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:39,080
And this shrimp

419
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:41,480
Shrimp heads and tails have fallen loose

420
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:42,720
Shrimp shell is black

421
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,881
And it feels slippery and sticky

422
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:48,881
It's not like you said you just died.

423
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,080
These ingredients

424
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:52,001
Don't you dare send it to the palace

425
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,921
How exactly did you check it

426
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,001
Serve meals to calm one's anger

427
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,881
Today, Your Majesty gives a banquet to his ministers

428
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,401
Guanglu Temple is busy up and down

429
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,681
Maybe it was a momentary negligence

430
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:02,801
Besides, this fish and shrimp transportation

431
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:03,840
It's a long way

432
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:05,681
Inevitable

433
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,281
Food is to be imported

434
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,320
The taste can be covered with heavy oil and heavy salt

435
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,720
But are the ingredients fresh

436
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,240
What is the appearance of the product

437
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,840
Can you fool yourself

438
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,561
With this stale ingredient

439
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,240
Not only will it damage the body of diners

440
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:26,641
It will even ruin the conscience of the diner

441
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,681
My heart has rotted

442
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,681
What qualifications do you have to make meals

443
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,681
Return all these ingredients to me

444
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:35,161
Yes

445
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
Move quickly. Move quickly

446
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,921
Meng Shang Shi

447
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,561
All the ingredients used in the palace are carefully selected

448
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:00,561
There is such a mistake today

449
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,200
It is nothing more than Guanglu Temple favoring Shangshan Supervisor

450
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,320
Deliberately let us lose

451
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:08,401
Forget all kinds of difficulties on weekdays

452
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,641
Now I can't even use such despicable means

453
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:14,881
Let's all move up

454
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,720
Your Excellency is wise

455
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:24,960
Have a long plan

456
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,840
These ingredients are all stored in advance by me

457
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:32,041
Check well and don't make any more mistakes

458
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:33,120
Yes

459
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:07,521
Go and bite

460
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:08,881
Bite it

461
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,161
Bite bite

462
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:10,641
Bite

463
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,161
Go on, grab its eyes

464
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:12,881
Bite it

465
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:13,881
Yes, yes, you throw yourself at it

466
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
You bite it

467
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,681
Bite it. Come on, you go up, go up

468
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,801
Bite it

469
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:20,720
Right

470
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:21,801
Bite it

471
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:22,401
Come on

472
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:23,120
Bite

473
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:24,641
Bite it

474
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,641
Right, right, right

475
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:26,561
There it goes

476
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,720
Bite and bite

477
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,001
Bite it

478
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,600
Bite it

479
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,240
Your Highness

480
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,281
Don't you want to see cockfighting

481
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:39,200
Up, up, up

482
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,600
It's all ready

483
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,521
One big one and one small one

484
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
Which one do you think can win

485
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,960
A small one

486
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,720
Small

487
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,200
Then this time

488
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:51,001
The handmaiden dared to gamble with your highness

489
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
I think the big one can win

490
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,360
You take your men and get twenty sticks

491
00:33:59,041 --> 00:33:59,561
Your Highness

492
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,600
Bite it right to right

493
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:02,840
Something that doesn't live up to expectations

494
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,761
Just bite

495
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:04,200
Up, up, up

496
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,240
Come on

497
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,161
Good bite

498
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,401
I lost my money in vain

499
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:10,080
I lost my money in vain

500
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,881
The little one wins

501
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:47,960
Miss Su

502
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:51,480
Miss Su

503
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:55,761
What can I do for you

504
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,680
Lord Siqing asked me to send a new food list

505
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,920
Meng Shangshi personally checked this food list

506
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,240
Just six more courses

507
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:15,200
I wonder what's wrong with it

508
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:17,920
No

509
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:18,960
We'll get it done

510
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,081
Wang Si's meal

511
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,480
You see

512
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,880
But it can be carved thinner down here

513
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,680
Good

514
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,200
Miss Su

515
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,200
Shang Shanjian adjusted the food list

516
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,720
The first one is to explode two pieces

517
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,680
Then we still burn sea cucumbers with onions

518
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,121
The last line

519
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,440
It's all three things of happiness and longevity

520
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
Fushou Quan's three things bring together abalone and sea cucumber

521
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,640
Fish lips and other ingredients

522
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,801
Three things about happiness and longevity with authentic taste

523
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,680
Soup alone has to be boiled for ten hours

524
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:19,041
People are prepared at all

525
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,400
I want to disgrace the food bureau

526
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,680
Be caught off guard

527
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,761
The Food Bureau is disgraced

528
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:25,960
What kind of coke do you have

529
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,001
Serving should also pay attention to the order

530
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:30,680
Once you have eaten all three things of longevity,

531
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,240
The dishes in the back are boring

532
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,720
The last line

533
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,001
It was originally Zi Jin

534
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
Don't delay the hour

535
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Let's get started, everybody

536
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,001
Yes

537
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:10,640
Your Excellency

538
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:13,001
Come with me

539
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,081
Your Excellency

540
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,041
Ganqing Palace has a good banquet on New Year's Eve tonight

541
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,001
The humble position is responsible for guarding the palace

542
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,561
Dare not go AWOL easily

543
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:22,561
The security guards of the palace will be handed over to Liu Qian for the time being

544
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,640
You and I have other priorities

545
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,720
Let's go

546
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:40,561
Let Grandpa Huang drink less wine tonight

547
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,240
Emperor

548
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,041
Your Highness, Emperor Taisun, advises you to drink less

549
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:44,920
Why don't you eat it

550
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:48,640
Recipe canon meal

551
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,200
Recipe canon meal

552
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:54,440
That fried sea cucumber with green onion

553
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,041
Your Majesty only looked at it

554
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:57,561
I never touched it again

555
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:01,081
I said earlier that this year's sea cucumber looks bad

556
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:01,960
I told you to change black ginseng

557
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,720
You won't listen

558
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:05,160
The taste of inferior ingredients is naturally inferior

559
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:06,841
Where can black ginseng match sea cucumber

560
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,480
Is Meng Shangshi very angry

561
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:12,361
Explore again

562
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:13,041
Yes

563
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:17,041
Quickly

564
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,041
Go ahead and prepare the rest

565
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,081
Let's go

566
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:25,720
The delicious taste of a pot

567
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,361
Can you hold down all three things of happiness and longevity

568
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,601
Steamed sea cucumbers and fish maw are hard to hold

569
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,200
A thick soup that has been boiled for more than ten hours

570
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,601
What's more, it's too late now

571
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,720
That

572
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,761
What about mutton

573
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,720
Neither this nor that

574
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:47,521
Is that all

575
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:49,001
Lose the game helplessly

576
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,321
Let me think again

577
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:12,801
Zi Jin

578
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:14,321
What exactly are you looking for

579
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:37,801
It's interesting

580
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,761
Don't underestimate this dish

581
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Just this kung fu of removing bones without hurting flesh and blood

582
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:45,601
Just get it

583
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,160
Grandpa Emperor

584
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,321
This pigeon meat is steamed to death

585
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,920
And the soup is very nourishing

586
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,960
You try

587
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:21,200
Meng Shangshi accepted it

588
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,960
This clear soup cabbage is not really clear soup

589
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,761
There should be something in it

590
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,321
Duck, chicken and ham

591
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:52,321
As Your Highness said

592
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:55,720
It is a meal specially cooked by Shangshi Bureau for the Prince

593
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:10,281
There is a folk saying

594
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:12,761
No ham is not beautiful, no chicken is not fresh

595
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,240
No duck, no fragrance, no elbow, no thick

596
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:16,160
That's right

597
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,521
Be an expert
