Diners have different moods

00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,800
The taste will be different

4
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,480
I think it's the cook who doesn't pay attention

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360

00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,839
It is inevitable that there will be negligence

Your Highness

Hanwang can't afford to kneel in Ganqing Palace

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,000
The prince can't persuade

Can you persuade it back if you persuade it

Grandpa Huang will be in tears when he sees it

How hot is the medicine of Lingji Palace

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,039
It is easy to stagnate phlegm and reverse qi

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,320
I really can't take it anymore

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,359
Today he persuaded His Majesty to use less Fu medicine

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
As a result, Your Majesty was furious with thunder

62
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,200
The staff of two attendants who followed the persuasion did not say

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,760
But also drove out Lord Yuan

64
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,839
Your Majesty has had many nightmares recently

65
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,600
The dragon body is not as good as before

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,519

Lord You

Do you feel dirty

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,959
My Lord misunderstood

Handmaiden has read this volume

94
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,720
It's all in mind. Don't look at it again

95
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:19,880
I don't believe it

It's also my birthday

Where are my longevity noodles

112
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,160
Today, Your Majesty gives Laba noodles to his ministers

By convention

114
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,640
It was prepared by Guanglu Temple

115
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,839
I don't want Laba noodles

116
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,040
It's my longevity noodles

117
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,799
Is it delicious

You take a bite, too

121
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,239
Niang doesn't eat

122
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,040
You eat quickly

123
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,159
Looks like the craftsmanship is not very good

00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,039

I haven't done anything bad lately

129
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,799
What he did was all slander

130
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,960
Misunderstood

131
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,760
Today is the birthday of Lord You

132
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,080
He only ordered a bowl of longevity noodles

133
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,599
This is Shangshi Bureau

134
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Not Guanglu Temple

135
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,119
Nor is it a food supervisor

136
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
No meals for the guards on duty

137
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,400
Keep your voice down

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,119
The King of Hell came to knock at the door

139
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,479
Why don't you hurry and hide far away

140
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,559
You don't think your life is long

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,280
Stop it

142
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
If you send it away, it will be over

143
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,760
You also lay an egg

144
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
You're afraid he can't rely on you

145
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,239
When I was a child, when I celebrated my birthday,

146
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,080
That's how my mother made it for me

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,679
After that, if I have a birthday,

148
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,440
You have to do the same for me

149
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll lay two eggs for you then

150
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,919
How is it

151
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,400
Almost

152
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,559
Everybody hurry up

153
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,479
Is this wintersweet for setting dishes

154
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,679
The words of returning adults

155
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,919
It is used to cook plum blossom porridge

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Plum blossoms can also cook porridge

157
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,400
Plum blossom clears heat and promotes fluid production

158
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,599
It can be used to cook soup and stew porridge

159
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,119
What else do you want, Lord You

160
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,559
How come everyone in the food bureau is still

161
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,640
Are so afraid of me

162
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,719
I told you about last time

163
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,119
It's just a misunderstanding

164
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,320
I have come to apologize with all my heart

165
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,679
Lord You

166
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,440
You stepped on my plum branch

167
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,799
Come

168
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,640
Come here

169
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,239
To

170
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,239
Get me one

171
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,960
Be careful to burn

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,919
Be careful to burn it

173
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:07,719
Delicious

174
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,159
Haven't Yuehua come back yet

175
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,760
Moon flower

176
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,400
That's right

177
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,719
None of you

178
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,280
Prepare longevity noodles for adults you

179
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,520
No, no, no, no

180
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,000
No

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,479
I was busy preparing Laba porridge yesterday

182
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,760
I forgot to tell you

183
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,960
If Lord You comes today,

184
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,400
Do try to avoid him

185
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,320
Why

186
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,599
Since he took office,

187
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,919
Laba Festival will come here on this day

188
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,679
Who can cook for him

189
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,000
Either dead or injured within three months

190
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Be very evil

191
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,119
Shang Shanjian, everyone says it

192
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,719
Laba Festival travels to the door of Yan Wang

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,320
Stay away no matter what

194
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,000
Then why do you say it now

195
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,280
How

196
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,359
You can't have prepared meals for him, can you

197
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,039
After Laba is the year

198
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,359
Be careful

199
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,400
I am not afraid of you

200
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,599
Not afraid of you

201
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,599
I am the real dragon emperor

202
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,440
Grandpa Emperor

203
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,320
It's me

204
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,599
Your Majesty, is it better to be a doctor in Xuansheng

205
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,880
No need
Free at kisskh.me

206
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,239
I am very healthy

207
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,760
Don't use Xuan Tai Yi

208
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,760
No need

209
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,520
Grandpa Emperor

210
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,239
Today is Laba Festival

211
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,679
Children

212
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,799
You're growing up

213
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,119
This heavy burden will fall on your shoulders in the future

214
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,599
Grandpa Huang can rest assured

215
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,880
And my father is here

216
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
It's nothing like me

217
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,960
Don't let me down

218
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,719
Grandpa Emperor

219
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,599
When have grandchildren ever let you down

220
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,479
Go and do that thing

221
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,919
Don't let anyone know

222
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:29,760
Get it

223
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,799
Yes

224
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,280
Go ahead

225
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,159
Sovereign

226
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,479
The prince has something important to report

227
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,719
The news from the royal palace

228
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,599
Plum blossoms can also cook porridge

229
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,359
Plum blossom clears heat and promotes fluid production

230
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,439
It can be used to cook soup and stew porridge

231
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,040
Emperor

232
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,599
Pepsi Daji Box

233
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,280
Miss Yao

234
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
Your Highness enjoys plum blossoms in Qiongyuan

235
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,040
Would you please make a run

236
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,319
Send the food box in person

237
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,319
Yes

238
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,839
Miss Yao is here

239
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,760
Then you wait here for a while

240
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:41,839
I'll inform you

241
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,801
Your Highness

242
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Do you think my piano sound is refined

243
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:40,921
Your Highness

244
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
Your Highness, what are you looking at

245
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,281
Wu Cairen forgives sins

246
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:01,281
Handmaiden made a momentary mistake

247
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,561
It has stained your clothes

248
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,001
Might as well do something

249
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,240
I'll just go back and change it

250
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:07,041
You rest

251
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:07,801
I'll be back in a minute

252
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,681
Your Highness, the men from the food bureau are here

253
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,761
Is it

254
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,320
Your Highness, the handmaiden will invite it now

255
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,360
Miss Yao, let's go

256
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,761
Your Highness

257
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,200
If you are told to wait, you will wait

258
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:14,801
Can't you talk

259
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,761
Are you going to freeze to death

260
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
To make me feel guilty

261
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,521
I'm telling you

262
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,281
Even if you freeze to death

263
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,921
I won't feel bad either

264
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:36,641
Your Highness

265
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:38,440
The food is getting cold

266
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,401
Handmaiden takes it back and redoes it

267
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,320
Don't be angry

268
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:43,320
It's too cold

269
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:44,401
The food will be cold

270
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
Your Highness, calm down

271
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,281
Handmaiden will go back now

272
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:48,001
Yao Ziliao

273
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,161
Without your highness's orders

274
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,561
The handmaiden is really going back

275
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,320
OK, then I'll beg you

276
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,161
See if you can still act like a handmaiden

277
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:58,960
To treat the master

278
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,801
Your Highness

279
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,761
Handmaiden yesterday

280
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Has been officially promoted to the palm meal of the Shang Food Bureau

281
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,240
A palm meal of low grade

282
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:17,801
Do you really want it?

283
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:19,921
Wang, the female official of that year

284
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,921
Famous for his moral knowledge

285
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,921
The holy man wants to be recruited as a concubine

286
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,641
Quan Fei even invited her to accompany her

287
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,161
So glorious

288
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,641
She also declined politely

289
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,281
Insist on going out of the palace and returning home

290
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,001
Far from forcing her

291
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,080
He also gave a lot of money on the day of returning home

292
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,120
Slaves dare not compare themselves to sages

293
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:43,840
But your highness has always followed the example of the Holy One

294
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,681
The Holy One is so broad-minded

295
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:50,041
Your Highness is also shine on you

296
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,480
How can you force a palace maid

297
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,360
You said the word "Xinyue" yourself

298
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,840
Have you forgotten all about it

299
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,960
How can I forget

300
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,320
How dare you forget

301
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:06,320
I only wish your heart were like mine

302
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,001
I will not live up to my lovesickness

303
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,001
But your heart

304
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,681
Do you really know my heart

305
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,881
Even though the handmaiden's status is humble,

306
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:19,240
I dare not pay my heart

307
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:31,440
You stop

308
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,041
Chen Wu

309
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,041
Send her back in person

310
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:48,320
Yes

311
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,041
Go and get twenty sticks

312
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,720
Your Highness, the handmaiden is wronged

313
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,281
It's really snowing so hard

314
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:22,360
How unjust the handmaiden is

315
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,041
Is the handmaiden to take it out on you

316
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,881
Forty

317
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Forty

318
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,641
Show us quickly

319
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,001
I want to see it, too. I want to see it, too

320
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,921
How nice

321
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,681
It's awesome. Yeah

322
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:34,881
So many

323
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:36,960
See what dishes are available

324
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:38,521
Let me see
Free at kisskh.me

325
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,200
Purple Azolla

326
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:45,561
It's so cold outside

327
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:47,561
Why are they all freezing through

328
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:48,720
Didn't you bring an umbrella

329
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,921
I said I'd go

330
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:51,881
You're so weak

331
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,080
Why are you still running around

332
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,600
Nothing, nothing

333
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,200
Much better

334
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:02,360
What's the matter

335
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,041
Would you like to see our specialty

336
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,080
Just in response to his this

337
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,921
Yes, I'm sure I can beat them

338
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:10,960
What happened to them

339
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:12,921
I heard that at the New Year's Eve banquet every year,

340
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,681
The food bureau and the food supervisor have to compete

341
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:16,720
Winners

342
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,521
You can get the right to enter imperial food next year

343
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,001
But this year's other side's dishes

344
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,041
She actually found out all about it

345
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,600
Strange to say

346
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,360
Shangshanjian is holding back more energy than Shangshanju

347
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:32,720
How can you expose your food list

348
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,480
Where did she come from

349
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,080
I'll see what's in the back

350
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:52,200
Not that Cao Zhou is in trouble

351
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,401
This peony arriving in Beijing after Mid-Autumn Festival

352
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,281
Are they all grown in Henan

353
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:58,401
I told them

354
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:00,200
Don't send peony seeds this year

355
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,041
But the flower farmers heard that

356
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,521
The empress in the palace is for disaster relief

357
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,240
I even donated my own hairpin jewelry

358
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,840
I personally picked out the best flower seeds and sent them

359
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,001
The palace moved them into a warm cave

360
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
It has been raised for quite a while

361
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
How can little help be worthy of gratitude

362
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,521
It makes me feel very sad in my heart

363
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,200
When the mother was there,

364
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:32,561
In winter, I am afraid that heavy snow will crush private houses

365
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,041
In the heat, I was worried that the scorching sun burned the crops

366
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,480
I still don't feel at ease when I leave

367
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,681
Thinking about the wives and children of the soldiers killed in the counter-insurgency

368
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,840
I told my father to give them awards and pensions

369
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,041
This is the true virtue of women

370
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,161
Now we are in the harem

371
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:53,281
Can do your part

372
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,320
It didn't live up to her kindness

373
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:01,480
Crown Princess

374
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
You emulate Empress Ren Xiao everywhere

375
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:07,281
It's really my duty to take the mother instrument as my duty

376
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:09,801
Guo Bianfei, please be careful

377
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,521
If such words are spread out,

378
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,801
How do you call the Crown Princess to live by herself

379
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,161
Founding hero family

380
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,480
There is such a nun virtue as you

381
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
An unscrupulous woman

382
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:23,561
I am not afraid of losing the reputation of the Guo family

383
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,440
Tang Tang Han Wang Fu

384
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,921
In order to be jealous,

385
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,801
Make no sense of honor or inferiority

386
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,641
How

387
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,200
Do you deserve to talk about women's virtue

388
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,240
Empress Zhuang Fei

389
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
This Qiongyuan is windy

390
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:42,561
I felt dizzy after enjoying the flowers for a while

391
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,401
Forgive me for being rude

392
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,240
One step ahead

393
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,161
Sister-in-law, don't dispute with her

394
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,480
She is a notoriously asshole

395
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:01,360
It is important that you take good care of yourself

396
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:07,001
After all, this peony is not a festival

397
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,641
It can't be raised well in the warm pavilion

398
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:13,320
I think the plum blossoms in front are blooming very well

399
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,881
Come on, let's go and have a look

400
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:31,840
Guo Bianfei is too domineering

401
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,840
My father has always been humble and benevolent

402
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,521
How can you make her so lawless

403
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,240
Guo Bianfei is his father's favorite princess

404
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:39,480
They are also our elders

405
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,401
How can the younger generation talk about the gains and losses of the elders

406
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:48,840
Look at this little story

407
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,240
It's really angry. I'm also angry

408
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,960
Wu Cairen

409
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
This is the holy year

410
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,480
Specially prepared for the Empress

411
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,401
What about the best peony

412
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,401
Miao Xian

413
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,960
Coming, coming

414
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,600
Let's go

415
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:28,120
These fish you sent

416
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:30,161
Fish scales are dull

417
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,080
The scales have fallen off

418
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:34,080
And this shrimp

419
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,480
Shrimp heads and tails have fallen loose

420
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,720
Shrimp shell is black

421
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,881
And it feels slippery and sticky

422
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,881
It's not like you said you just died.

423
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:45,080
These ingredients

424
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,001
Don't you dare send it to the palace

425
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,921
How exactly did you check it

426
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,001
Serve meals to calm one's anger

427
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,881
Today, Your Majesty gives a banquet to his ministers

428
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,401
Guanglu Temple is busy up and down

429
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,681
Maybe it was a momentary negligence

430
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,801
Besides, this fish and shrimp transportation

431
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:58,840
It's a long way

432
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:00,681
Inevitable

433
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,281
Food is to be imported
Free at kisskh.me

434
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,320
The taste can be covered with heavy oil and heavy salt

435
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
But are the ingredients fresh

436
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,240
What is the appearance of the product

437
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
Can you fool yourself

438
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,561
With this stale ingredient

439
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,240
Not only will it damage the body of diners

440
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:21,641
It will even ruin the conscience of the diner

441
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,681
My heart has rotted

442
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,681
What qualifications do you have to make meals

443
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:28,681
Return all these ingredients to me

444
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,161
Yes

445
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,120
Move quickly. Move quickly

446
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,921
Meng Shang Shi

447
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:53,561
All the ingredients used in the palace are carefully selected

448
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:55,561
There is such a mistake today

449
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,200
It is nothing more than Guanglu Temple favoring Shangshan Supervisor

450
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
Deliberately let us lose

451
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,401
Forget all kinds of difficulties on weekdays

452
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,641
Now I can't even use such despicable means

453
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:09,881
Let's all move up

454
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,720
Your Excellency is wise

455
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:19,960
Have a long plan

456
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,840
These ingredients are all stored in advance by me

457
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:27,041
Check well and don't make any more mistakes

458
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:28,120
Yes

459
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,521
Go and bite

460
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:03,881
Bite it

461
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:05,161
Bite bite

462
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:05,641
Bite

463
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,161
Go on, grab its eyes

464
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:07,881
Bite it

465
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:08,881
Yes, yes, you throw yourself at it

466
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
You bite it

467
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,681
Bite it. Come on, you go up, go up

468
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,801
Bite it

469
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:15,720
Right

470
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:16,801
Bite it

471
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:17,401
Come on

472
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:18,120
Bite

473
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:19,641
Bite it

474
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,641
Right, right, right

475
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:21,561
There it goes

476
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,720
Bite and bite

477
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,001
Bite it

478
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,600
Bite it

479
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,240
Your Highness

480
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,281
Don't you want to see cockfighting

481
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:34,200
Up, up, up

482
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,600
It's all ready

483
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,521
One big one and one small one

484
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Which one do you think can win

485
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,960
A small one

486
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,720
Small

487
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,200
Then this time

488
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:46,001
The handmaiden dared to gamble with your highness

489
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
I think the big one can win

490
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,360
You take your men and get twenty sticks

491
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:54,561
Your Highness

492
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,600
Bite it right to right

493
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:57,840
Something that doesn't live up to expectations

494
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,761
Just bite

495
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,200
Up, up, up

496
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,240
Come on

497
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,161
Good bite

498
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,401
I lost my money in vain

499
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,080
I lost my money in vain

500
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,881
The little one wins

501
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,960
Miss Su

502
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:46,480
Miss Su

503
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:50,761
What can I do for you

504
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,680
Lord Siqing asked me to send a new food list

505
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,920
Meng Shangshi personally checked this food list

506
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,240
Just six more courses

507
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,200
I wonder what's wrong with it

508
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:12,920
No

509
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:13,960
We'll get it done

510
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,081
Wang Si's meal

511
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,480
You see

512
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,880
But it can be carved thinner down here

513
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,680
Good

514
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,200
Miss Su

515
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,200
Shang Shanjian adjusted the food list

516
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,720
The first one is to explode two pieces

517
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:57,680
Then we still burn sea cucumbers with onions

518
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,121
The last line

519
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,440
It's all three things of happiness and longevity

520
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,200
Fushou Quan's three things bring together abalone and sea cucumber

521
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,640
Fish lips and other ingredients

522
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,801
Three things about happiness and longevity with authentic taste

523
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,680
Soup alone has to be boiled for ten hours

524
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:14,041
People are prepared at all

525
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,400
I want to disgrace the food bureau

526
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
Be caught off guard

527
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,761
The Food Bureau is disgraced

528
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:20,960
What kind of coke do you have

529
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,001
Serving should also pay attention to the order

530
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,680
Once you have eaten all three things of longevity,

531
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,240
The dishes in the back are boring

532
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,720
The last line

533
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,001
It was originally Zi Jin

534
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,680
Don't delay the hour

535
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Let's get started, everybody

536
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,001
Yes

537
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:05,640
Your Excellency

538
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,001
Come with me

539
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:09,081
Your Excellency

540
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,041
Ganqing Palace has a good banquet on New Year's Eve tonight

541
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,001
The humble position is responsible for guarding the palace

542
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,561
Dare not go AWOL easily

543
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:17,561
The security guards of the palace will be handed over to Liu Qian for the time being

544
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,640
You and I have other priorities

545
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,720
Let's go

546
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:35,561
Let Grandpa Huang drink less wine tonight

547
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,240
Emperor

548
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:52,041
Your Highness, Emperor Taisun, advises you to drink less

549
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:39,920
Why don't you eat it

550
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:43,640
Recipe canon meal

551
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,200
Recipe canon meal

552
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:49,440
That fried sea cucumber with green onion

553
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:51,041
Your Majesty only looked at it

554
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:52,561
I never touched it again

555
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:56,081
I said earlier that this year's sea cucumber looks bad

556
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:56,960
I told you to change black ginseng

557
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,720
You won't listen

558
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,160
The taste of inferior ingredients is naturally inferior

559
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,841
Where can black ginseng match sea cucumber

560
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
Is Meng Shangshi very angry

561
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,361
Explore again

562
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,041
Yes

563
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:12,041
Quickly

564
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,041
Go ahead and prepare the rest

565
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,081
Let's go

566
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:20,720
The delicious taste of a pot

567
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,361
Can you hold down all three things of happiness and longevity

568
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,601
Steamed sea cucumbers and fish maw are hard to hold

569
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,200
A thick soup that has been boiled for more than ten hours

570
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,601
What's more, it's too late now

571
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,720
That

572
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:37,761
What about mutton

573
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,720
Neither this nor that

574
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,521
Is that all

575
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:44,001
Lose the game helplessly

576
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,321
Let me think again

577
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:07,801
Zi Jin

578
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:09,321
What exactly are you looking for

579
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,801
It's interesting

580
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,761
Don't underestimate this dish

581
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Just this kung fu of removing bones without hurting flesh and blood

582
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:40,601
Just get it

583
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,160
Grandpa Emperor

584
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:50,321
This pigeon meat is steamed to death

585
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,920
And the soup is very nourishing

586
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,960
You try

587
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,200
Meng Shangshi accepted it

588
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,960
This clear soup cabbage is not really clear soup

589
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,761
There should be something in it

590
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:43,321
Duck, chicken and ham

591
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,321
As Your Highness said
Free at kisskh.me

592
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:50,720
It is a meal specially cooked by Shangshi Bureau for the Prince

593
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:05,281
There is a folk saying

594
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,761
No ham is not beautiful, no chicken is not fresh

595
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,240
No duck, no fragrance, no elbow, no thick

596
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,160
That's right

597
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,521
Be an expert
