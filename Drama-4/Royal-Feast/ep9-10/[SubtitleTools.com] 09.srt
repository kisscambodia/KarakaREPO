1
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,200
Why don't you use Tibetan fragrant pigs or mullet roe

2
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,281
No, no, no

3
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:35,360
Some people have used it

4
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,641
What else can I use

5
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:39,761
I have my own way

6
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,360
Really

7
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,360
You go

8
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:44,161
You go busy

9
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:45,681
Come on, come on, come on

10
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,720
Go ahead

11
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,001
You see

12
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:18,360
Why is she cutting cucumbers

13
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,001
This is not giving up

14
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:34,360
Are you here yet

15
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,761
Coming, coming

16
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:55,521
Taisun, please sit down

17
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:58,120
Father

18
00:21:58,641 --> 00:21:59,480
I heard that you are ill

19
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:00,761
Can you please have a doctor too much

20
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,041
What disease is it

21
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:09,161
Headache

22
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,681
No

23
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,840
It's here

24
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,801
A gouge out of the heart

25
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,041
The whole bifurcation

26
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,120
Just

27
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:23,801
It all hurts

28
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,600
Since my father is ill,

29
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,080
You should rest assured of illness

30
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,521
Have any errands

31
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:37,921
Even if you tell your son

32
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,761
Seriously

33
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,440
Seriously

34
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,681
Good

35
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:58,561
Lord You

36
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,641
Don't be so serious

37
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,401
I'm not here to find fault today

38
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:05,960
Lord Liu entered the palace to meet him

39
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,120
I came to see the meal list prepared for the mission

40
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm just leading the way

41
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,600
Meng Shang Shi

42
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:14,120
Last year, the meal list of Guanglu Temple was not suitable for taste

43
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,080
Almost caused trouble

44
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,801
This year, the prince gave orders

45
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:17,720
To personally supervise

46
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,320
You can't be sloppy at all

47
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:23,320
Lord You has dealt with those people a lot

48
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,960
That's why he was asked to take a closer look

49
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:28,281
Your Excellencies

50
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,480
Please come with me

51
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,120
Delicious meat

52
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,440
But it's not greasy

53
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,161
It's completely different from the usual pork

54
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
Tibetan fragrant pigs sent by Wusi Zangdusi

55
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,840
What adults say is right

56
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,720
This kind of pig grows in mountains and forests

57
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:02,200
Drinking natural mountain springs

58
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,240
Eating wild people participate in pine mushrooms

59
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,521
So the meat is delicate and mellow

60
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:07,360
Fresh and tender

61
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,041
Handmaiden wants to

62
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,561
Most guests come from the sea

63
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,161
I have never tasted the delicious food in Tibet

64
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,720
This is how to cook soup with the spine of Tibetan fragrant pigs

65
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,161
The front legs are made of lion heads

66
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:17,600
This kind of pork

67
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:19,480
No matter how it is cooked,

68
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:21,240
Are not disappointing

69
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:23,281
Well said

70
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,120
I am the only one in the world

71
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,120
Where can I find this ginseng pig again

72
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,360
It's so delicious

73
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,240
Good

74
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,801
With ginger pepper

75
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,281
Unripe fragrant floating nose

76
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Puffer fish is poisonous

77
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,120
River perch is ashamed and tasteless

78
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
Swordfish is indeed the first in Jiangxian

79
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,281
But now the spring season has not arrived

80
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,881
I used dried fish to send it away

81
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,720
I also used gold foil

82
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,360
This is the commonplace color

83
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,281
Wrapped in silk and silk

84
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:03,281
Is a peerless beauty

85
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Self-deception

86
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,161
Step down

87
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,120
Step down

88
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,041
Why add pepper to it

89
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,641
In my hometown

90
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,801
Pepper all the way from Sumatra

91
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:46,840
Shipped from Guri

92
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,001
Price is more precious than gold

93
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,401
Your Excellency

94
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,681
This is a tribute girl who has just arrived

95
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,360
Pepper is piled up in the library in China

96
00:25:58,561 --> 00:25:59,681
But you judge people by their own merits

97
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,001
Offer such cheap things as treasures

98
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:03,240
Wouldn't it be disrespectful

99
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,641
Handmaiden has shallow knowledge

100
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:05,801
Please forgive me

101
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,240
What is the faux pas

102
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,401
The arrival of His Highness unknown

103
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:20,480
Please forgive me for the loss of welcome

104
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:22,360
It's a small matter to entertain guests

105
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,281
It's a big thing to lose the national system

106
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:26,360
I heard everything you said just now

107
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,681
All over the world

108
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:28,440
Murphy Wang Tu

109
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,401
Lead the shore of soil

110
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:30,080
Murphy Wang Chen

111
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:33,080
China began in Qin and Han Dynasties

112
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,960
He kept coming and going with the Gentiles

113
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,960
As for me, it is even more so

114
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,120
Grandpa Huang's thousands of orders

115
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,120
Where does the caravan go

116
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,281
Whether by sea or land

117
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,200
You can't bully the widow, you can't bully the weak

118
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,320
Some places don't know the weather

119
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:49,681
He gave the calendar

120
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,960
Church farming

121
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:53,720
In some places banana leaves are used as food utensils

122
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,801
People can only eat cold food

123
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:58,001
It is necessary to open a ceramic mutual market

124
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,161
Give acupuncture herbs

125
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,960
In some places, etiquette and customs are impassable

126
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:03,881
Fighting constantly

127
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,681
We will quell the war

128
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,521
Our fleet brought it

129
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:09,761
It's not just gorgeous silk and porcelain

130
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:12,281
But also Chinese herbal medicines

131
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:13,720
Acupuncture weaving

132
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:15,881
Architectural navigation

133
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:17,840
And a large number of Chinese classics

134
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:19,801
They all stay in overseas countries

135
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Why are we doing this

136
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Just because of the scourge of widowhood

137
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,200
Then there was chaos

138
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,600
Only the world is peaceful

139
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,681
Then the people in the world can enjoy happiness

140
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,240
So

141
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,881
She doesn't understand. You have to tell her

142
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,561
And treat them equally

143
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
Your Highness, please forgive me

144
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,840
These children are confined to the deep palace and have limited horizons

145
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,840
Your Highness's lesson is better than my ten years' work

146
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,200
Remember today's words

147
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:48,080
A person should have a broad mind and vision

148
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,561
It will be good for you all your life

149
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,921
Yes

150
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,761
Step down

151
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,080
A kind of red shrimp is mentioned in the collections of Materia Medica in Tang Dynasty

152
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:05,080
Shenglinhai Huiji

153
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:06,561
The big one is a foot long

154
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:07,521
Must can be a hairpin

155
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,881
Just in line with Taiping County Records

156
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,401
Colorful giant shrimp with abnormal burly

157
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:13,320
Exactly the same

158
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,360
Therefore, it is also called God Shrimp in Quanzhou Prefecture

159
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,720
Today, the traditional practice of local fishermen is specially adopted

160
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,360
Cook splendid shrimp rice

161
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:22,921
Please ask noble people to taste it

162
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,401
Where is the meal

163
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:27,440
Your Highness doesn't know

164
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,080
Rice in fishermen's mouth

165
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,801
Often refers to fish and shrimp

166
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Shrimp meat dipped in sauce has unique flavor

167
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,720
It makes people feel like they are back in the bow

168
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,761
The moment when the sea breeze blows

169
00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:59,080
Unspeakably relaxed and happy

170
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:03,240
Fresh and chewy

171
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:04,881
It's the smell of the sea

172
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:08,120
What do you say, Your Highness

173
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:23,720
Powder, waxy, sweet and endless aftertaste

174
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,041
Needless to say, betel nut and taro

175
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,120
Taro again

176
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,320
Crispy and sweet

177
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,041
Far better than steamed taro

178
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:20,681
Do two things with one impression

179
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Ordinary ingredients

180
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,921
Make an unusual taste

181
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,840
This is the craft

182
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,801
No matter how delicious it is

183
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,761
It's just some cut cucumbers

184
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,041
Fennel broad bean

185
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,281
Add a taro

186
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:36,720
Not even a shredded pork

187
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,200
Why is it so stingy

188
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,200
Are you going to win by quantity

189
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,521
Grandpa Huang asked his father to do errands

190
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,720
It happened that my father fell ill

191
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,200
But the emperor's life is the emperor's life

192
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,041
He is ill

193
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,161
Only I can come

194
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,720
Your Highness

195
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:31,440
Do you still need to ask the prince for instructions when you look at the meal list

196
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,281
Call the cook

197
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:52,360
Why use ordinary food

198
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:53,801
Back to your highness's words

199
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,881
Ancient cloud

200
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,480
It's a pleasure to have friends from afar

201
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,041
Entertain guests

202
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,200
It really should make them feel at home

203
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,440
But the people of our country are the most precious people

204
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,440
All the products of this land

205
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
It is a gift from God to the industrious people

206
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,081
They are the ones who should taste it most

207
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:15,521
And

208
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,680
When Zhang Qian sent to the Western Regions,

209
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,960
Brought back the ingredients you used today

210
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,561
Precious seeds

211
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,281
Take root and sprout in the land of China

212
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:26,121
After being cultivated from generation to generation,

213
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,720
In order to change the ever-changing delicious food

214
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:30,801
Throw me a wooden peach

215
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:31,640
Reward it with Qiong Yao

216
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:34,561
Prepare a meal list for the mission

217
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:37,361
In addition to delicacies

218
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:38,880
Add these too

219
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,880
The rice I just ate

220
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:53,880
It's very soft and delicious

221
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:56,521
Jingshan Bridge Rice

222
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:58,960
Huguang suffered a natural disaster last year

223
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,200
If this kind of rice is supplied to the diplomatic corps,

224
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,200
So the wealthy businessmen in Beijing

225
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,680
Will compete for it

226
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:06,041
In this way

227
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,240
The life of the people will be much better

228
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,880
It's just a little chef

229
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,920
How to have so many thoughts

230
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:20,640
It's just a coincidence

231
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:24,041
How come he's back

232
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:25,841
Your Excellency

233
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,880
Please

234
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:28,081
Please

235
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,121
All the way

236
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,920
The opal brought back from Hurumus

237
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:39,081
See if you like it or not

238
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,960
Thank you for your reward

239
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:44,960
Handmaiden is ashamed and afraid to accept it

240
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:50,640
Line line line

241
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:53,321
Miss Yao

242
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,480
Haven't you been looking for it before

243
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,001
Is this log book

244
00:35:57,561 --> 00:35:58,400
I sent it to you

245
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:00,081
I can't use it

246
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,801
Bring it all over

247
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:02,521
Keep it

248
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,281
Thank you for your handmaiden, Emperor Taisun, for your reward

249
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:11,801
Good

250
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,920
You tell her

251
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,240
One day

252
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:18,841
Our fleet brought it back

253
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,640
It won't be just jewelry and spices

254
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,240
There will be more products that benefit the Chinese people

255
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,160
It's over

256
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,720
I forgot the most important sentence

257
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,041
Walk, walk, walk

258
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,561
Reward

259
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:41,880
That's what she said

260
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,361
How dare that handmaiden reply indiscriminately

261
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,440
That's what Miss Yao said

262
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,440
Hurry up, hurry up

263
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,321
Come on, come on, come on

264
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,041
Quickly

265
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,801
Hurry up, hurry up

266
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:17,640
Father-in-law Yuan

267
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,041
Thank you very much

268
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,121
Go in by yourself

269
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:24,480
Go on

270
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,281
Open

271
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:03,480
Yes

272
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:16,920
What did you do today

273
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,361
Back to your highness's words

274
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:19,761
In accordance with established practice

275
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,640
Meal list from Guanglu Temple

276
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,121
The food bureau cooks according to the order

277
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:25,041
Yao Ziliao

278
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:31,121
Handmaiden is guilty, please punish your highness

279
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:32,761
What are your sins

280
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:35,281
Please show your highness that handmaiden is stupid

281
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,761
Get out of here

282
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,361
Handmaiden retires

283
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:47,761
You go and persuade her to come back

284
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,561
Don't come back if you can't persuade you to come back

285
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,081
Your Highness

286
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,521
How can this be called persuasion

287
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,281
I don't like her strange appearance

288
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:57,440
Your Highness

289
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,081
Miss Yao has no yin and yang

290
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,160
This is how handmaidens serve their masters

291
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,960
One question and one answer

292
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,841
Be careful

293
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,081
Without the slightest trespass

294
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:05,680
What's wrong with it

295
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:07,281
What's wrong with it

296
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:09,361
I never treated her like a handmaiden

297
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,001
Go quickly

298
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,521
Go on

299
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:19,920
Your Highness

300
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:22,200
You see

301
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,480
Is the month

302
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,561
Your Highness takes tonic

303
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,880
You can't bait hot things

304
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,680
Eat early

305
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,041
Duck Soup with Coix Seed and Lotus Seeds

306
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,601
Change hibiscus meat and silver carp tofu

307
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,640
Apricot goose mixed with broom

308
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,880
Cut the roe

309
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Go and get her back

310
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:24,200
This time

311
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,841
Go for me

312
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:27,761
Yes

313
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,121
Pinellia ternata

314
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,001
Three spoonfuls

315
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,001
Gold tooth powder

316
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,880
Zi Jin

317
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Look at my craft

318
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,081
Is it good-looking

319
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,400
This is too expensive

320
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:33,640
The pattern is too dense

321
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:35,761
But it's still much better

322
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,601
Make persistent efforts

323
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,121
Meng Shang Shi

324
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,240
Mr. Chan

325
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,521
Meng Shang's food is polite

326
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,640
Mr. Yisheng

327
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,400
Shame and dare not

328
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,321
I vaguely remember when Han Ying entered the palace for training

329
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,001
You have served as a teacher

330
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,521
It's worthwhile to call you sir

331
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,880
I wonder if you are visiting today

332
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,960
But what do you want from the emperor and grandson

333
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:18,480
Today, Lord Yang entered the palace

334
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,281
Taste Miss Yao's Suzhou Pastry

335
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,281
Quite elegant

336
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:23,361
I want to ask your kitchen to copy it

337
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:24,960
I came here specially to ask for a prescription to go back

338
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,561
This is a trivial matter

339
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:29,561
I asked Zi Jin to write it and send it to me

340
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,400
Why do you come to the door in person

341
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,160
Then thank Meng Shang for eating

342
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,121
I'll send someone to pick it up later

343
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:41,400
Good

344
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,200
Mr. Chen walks slowly and doesn't send it

345
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,841
Please forgive me, Lord Shang Shi

346
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:59,041
I am also afraid of missing my son's good future

347
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:00,521
Serve people with color

348
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:01,640
When what a good future

349
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:06,880
It's good to be young and ignorant

350
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,801
Avoid a lot of sorrow

351
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,081
There are palace rules in the palace

352
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,601
Female officials have more dignity of female officials

353
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:14,680
I'm still in the food bureau for a day

354
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,041
He was sheltered by me for one day

355
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,640
There is no reason to take it away by force

356
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,281
Do such a senseless thing next time

357
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,480
I won't be lenient

358
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:23,121
Yes

359
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:39,680
It tastes wrong

360
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,001
Your Highness

361
00:43:43,561 --> 00:43:44,521
Today's dish

362
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,001
It's exactly the same as yesterday

363
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:47,121
What's wrong

364
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:48,761
Try it yourself

365
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
How dare a handmaiden

366
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,321
Can't taste it

367
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,081
Your Highness, please make it clear

368
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
It's not that the dishes are wrong

369
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:13,920
It is your highness who is in a bad mood

370
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,920
Your Highness

371
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,321
The same food

372
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,920
Diners have different moods

373
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,121
The taste will be different

374
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,801
I think it's the cook who doesn't pay attention
