305
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
Why don't you use Tibetan fragrant pigs or mullet roe

306
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,281
No, no, no

307
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,360
Some people have used it

308
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,641
What else can I use

309
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:44,761
I have my own way

310
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,360
Really

311
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,360
You go

312
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:49,161
You go busy

313
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:50,681
Come on, come on, come on

314
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,720
Go ahead

315
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,001
You see

316
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,360
Why is she cutting cucumbers

317
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,001
This is not giving up

318
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:39,360
Are you here yet

319
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,761
Coming, coming

320
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:00,521
Taisun, please sit down

321
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:03,120
Father

322
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:04,480
I heard that you are ill

323
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:05,761
Can you please have a doctor too much

324
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,041
What disease is it

325
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:14,161
Headache

326
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,681
No

327
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:19,840
It's here

328
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:22,801
A gouge out of the heart

329
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,041
The whole bifurcation

330
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:27,120
Just

331
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:28,801
It all hurts

332
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:37,600
Since my father is ill,

333
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,080
You should rest assured of illness

334
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,521
Have any errands

335
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:42,921
Even if you tell your son

336
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,761
Seriously

337
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,440
Seriously

338
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,681
Good

339
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:03,561
Lord You

340
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:07,641
Don't be so serious

341
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,401
I'm not here to find fault today

342
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:10,960
Lord Liu entered the palace to meet him

343
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,120
I came to see the meal list prepared for the mission

344
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm just leading the way

345
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,600
Meng Shang Shi

346
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:19,120
Last year, the meal list of Guanglu Temple was not suitable for taste

347
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,080
Almost caused trouble

348
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,801
This year, the prince gave orders

349
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,720
To personally supervise

350
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,320
You can't be sloppy at all

351
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:28,320
Lord You has dealt with those people a lot

352
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,960
That's why he was asked to take a closer look

353
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:33,281
Your Excellencies

354
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,480
Please come with me

355
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,120
Delicious meat

356
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,440
But it's not greasy

357
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,161
It's completely different from the usual pork

358
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,960
Tibetan fragrant pigs sent by Wusi Zangdusi

359
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:03,840
What adults say is right

360
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,720
This kind of pig grows in mountains and forests

361
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:07,200
Drinking natural mountain springs

362
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,240
Eating wild people participate in pine mushrooms

363
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,521
So the meat is delicate and mellow

364
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:12,360
Fresh and tender

365
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,041
Handmaiden wants to

366
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,561
Most guests come from the sea

367
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,161
I have never tasted the delicious food in Tibet

368
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:19,720
This is how to cook soup with the spine of Tibetan fragrant pigs

369
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,161
The front legs are made of lion heads

370
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:22,600
This kind of pork

371
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,480
No matter how it is cooked,

372
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,240
Are not disappointing

373
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,281
Well said

374
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,120
I am the only one in the world

375
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,120
Where can I find this ginseng pig again

376
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,360
It's so delicious

377
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:36,240
Good

378
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,801
With ginger pepper

379
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,281
Unripe fragrant floating nose

380
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Puffer fish is poisonous

381
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,120
River perch is ashamed and tasteless

382
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,440
Swordfish is indeed the first in Jiangxian

383
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,281
But now the spring season has not arrived

384
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,881
I used dried fish to send it away

385
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,720
I also used gold foil

386
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,360
This is the commonplace color

387
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,281
Wrapped in silk and silk

388
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,281
Is a peerless beauty

389
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Self-deception

390
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,161
Step down

391
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,120
Step down

392
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,041
Why add pepper to it

393
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,641
In my hometown

394
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,801
Pepper all the way from Sumatra

395
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:51,840
Shipped from Guri

396
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,001
Price is more precious than gold

397
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:58,401
Your Excellency

398
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,681
This is a tribute girl who has just arrived

399
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,360
Pepper is piled up in the library in China

400
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,681
But you judge people by their own merits

401
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,001
Offer such cheap things as treasures

402
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,240
Wouldn't it be disrespectful

403
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:09,641
Handmaiden has shallow knowledge

404
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:10,801
Please forgive me

405
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,240
What is the faux pas

406
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,401
The arrival of His Highness unknown

407
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:25,480
Please forgive me for the loss of welcome

408
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:27,360
It's a small matter to entertain guests

409
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,281
It's a big thing to lose the national system

410
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,360
I heard everything you said just now

411
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,681
All over the world

412
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:33,440
Murphy Wang Tu

413
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,401
Lead the shore of soil

414
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:35,080
Murphy Wang Chen

415
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,080
China began in Qin and Han Dynasties

416
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,960
He kept coming and going with the Gentiles

417
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:42,960
As for me, it is even more so

418
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
Grandpa Huang's thousands of orders

419
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,120
Where does the caravan go

420
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,281
Whether by sea or land

421
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
You can't bully the widow, you can't bully the weak

422
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,320
Some places don't know the weather

423
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:54,681
He gave the calendar

424
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,960
Church farming

425
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,720
In some places banana leaves are used as food utensils

426
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,801
People can only eat cold food

427
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,001
It is necessary to open a ceramic mutual market

428
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,161
Give acupuncture herbs

429
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:06,960
In some places, etiquette and customs are impassable

430
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:08,881
Fighting constantly

431
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,681
We will quell the war

432
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,521
Our fleet brought it

433
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,761
It's not just gorgeous silk and porcelain

434
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,281
But also Chinese herbal medicines

435
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,720
Acupuncture weaving

436
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:20,881
Architectural navigation

437
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:22,840
And a large number of Chinese classics

438
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:24,801
They all stay in overseas countries

439
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,440
Why are we doing this

440
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Just because of the scourge of widowhood

441
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,200
Then there was chaos

442
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,600
Only the world is peaceful

443
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,681
Then the people in the world can enjoy happiness

444
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,240
So

445
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:35,881
She doesn't understand. You have to tell her

446
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,561
And treat them equally

447
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,600
Your Highness, please forgive me

448
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:44,840
These children are confined to the deep palace and have limited horizons

449
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,840
Your Highness's lesson is better than my ten years' work

450
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,200
Remember today's words

451
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:53,080
A person should have a broad mind and vision

452
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,561
It will be good for you all your life

453
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,921
Yes

454
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,761
Step down

455
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,080
A kind of red shrimp is mentioned in the collections of Materia Medica in Tang Dynasty

456
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:10,080
Shenglinhai Huiji

457
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:11,561
The big one is a foot long

458
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:12,521
Must can be a hairpin

459
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,881
Just in line with Taiping County Records

460
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,401
Colorful giant shrimp with abnormal burly

461
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:18,320
Exactly the same

462
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,360
Therefore, it is also called God Shrimp in Quanzhou Prefecture

463
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,720
Today, the traditional practice of local fishermen is specially adopted

464
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,360
Cook splendid shrimp rice

465
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:27,921
Please ask noble people to taste it

466
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,401
Where is the meal

467
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,440
Your Highness doesn't know

468
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,080
Rice in fishermen's mouth

469
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,801
Often refers to fish and shrimp

470
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Shrimp meat dipped in sauce has unique flavor

471
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,720
It makes people feel like they are back in the bow

472
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,761
The moment when the sea breeze blows

473
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,080
Unspeakably relaxed and happy

474
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:08,240
Fresh and chewy

475
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:09,881
It's the smell of the sea

476
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:13,120
What do you say, Your Highness

477
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,720
Powder, waxy, sweet and endless aftertaste

478
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,041
Needless to say, betel nut and taro

479
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,120
Taro again

480
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,320
Crispy and sweet

481
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:24,041
Far better than steamed taro

482
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:25,681
Do two things with one impression

483
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Ordinary ingredients

484
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,921
Make an unusual taste

485
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:30,840
This is the craft

486
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:35,801
No matter how delicious it is

487
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,761
It's just some cut cucumbers

488
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,041
Fennel broad bean

489
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,281
Add a taro

490
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:41,720
Not even a shredded pork

491
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,200
Why is it so stingy

492
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,200
Are you going to win by quantity

493
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,521
Grandpa Huang asked his father to do errands

494
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:27,720
It happened that my father fell ill

495
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,200
But the emperor's life is the emperor's life

496
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,041
He is ill

497
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:31,161
Only I can come

498
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,720
Your Highness

499
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:36,440
Do you still need to ask the prince for instructions when you look at the meal list

500
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,281
Call the cook

501
00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:57,360
Why use ordinary food

502
00:33:57,921 --> 00:33:58,801
Back to your highness's words

503
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,881
Ancient cloud

504
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,480
It's a pleasure to have friends from afar

505
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,041
Entertain guests

506
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,200
It really should make them feel at home

507
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,440
But the people of our country are the most precious people

508
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,440
All the products of this land

509
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
It is a gift from God to the industrious people

510
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,081
They are the ones who should taste it most

511
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:20,521
And

512
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:22,680
When Zhang Qian sent to the Western Regions,

513
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,960
Brought back the ingredients you used today

514
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,561
Precious seeds

515
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,281
Take root and sprout in the land of China

516
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:31,121
After being cultivated from generation to generation,

517
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,720
In order to change the ever-changing delicious food

518
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:35,801
Throw me a wooden peach

519
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:36,640
Reward it with Qiong Yao

520
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:39,561
Prepare a meal list for the mission

521
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,361
In addition to delicacies

522
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:43,880
Add these too

523
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,880
The rice I just ate

524
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:58,880
It's very soft and delicious

525
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:01,521
Jingshan Bridge Rice

526
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:03,960
Huguang suffered a natural disaster last year

527
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:06,200
If this kind of rice is supplied to the diplomatic corps,

528
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:08,200
So the wealthy businessmen in Beijing

529
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,680
Will compete for it

530
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,041
In this way

531
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,240
The life of the people will be much better

532
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:21,880
It's just a little chef

533
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,920
How to have so many thoughts

534
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:25,640
It's just a coincidence

535
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,041
How come he's back

536
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:30,841
Your Excellency

537
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Please

538
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:33,081
Please

539
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,121
All the way

540
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:42,920
The opal brought back from Hurumus

541
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:44,081
See if you like it or not

542
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,960
Thank you for your reward

543
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:49,960
Handmaiden is ashamed and afraid to accept it

544
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:55,640
Line line line

545
00:35:57,761 --> 00:35:58,321
Miss Yao

546
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:00,480
Haven't you been looking for it before

547
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,001
Is this log book

548
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:03,400
I sent it to you

549
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:05,081
I can't use it

550
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,801
Bring it all over

551
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:07,521
Keep it

552
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:14,281
Thank you for your handmaiden, Emperor Taisun, for your reward

553
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:16,801
Good

554
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,920
You tell her

555
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,240
One day

556
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:23,841
Our fleet brought it back

557
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,640
It won't be just jewelry and spices

558
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,240
There will be more products that benefit the Chinese people

559
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,160
It's over

560
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,720
I forgot the most important sentence

561
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,041
Walk, walk, walk

562
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,561
Reward

563
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:46,880
That's what she said

564
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:49,361
How dare that handmaiden reply indiscriminately

565
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
That's what Miss Yao said

566
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,440
Hurry up, hurry up

567
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,321
Come on, come on, come on

568
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,041
Quickly

569
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,801
Hurry up, hurry up

570
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:22,640
Father-in-law Yuan

571
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,041
Thank you very much

572
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:27,121
Go in by yourself

573
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:29,480
Go on

574
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,281
Open

575
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:08,480
Yes

576
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:21,920
What did you do today

577
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,361
Back to your highness's words

578
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,761
In accordance with established practice

579
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:26,640
Meal list from Guanglu Temple

580
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,121
The food bureau cooks according to the order

581
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:30,041
Yao Ziliao

582
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:36,121
Handmaiden is guilty, please punish your highness

583
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:37,761
What are your sins

584
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:40,281
Please show your highness that handmaiden is stupid

585
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,761
Get out of here

586
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,361
Handmaiden retires

587
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:52,761
You go and persuade her to come back

588
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,561
Don't come back if you can't persuade you to come back

589
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,081
Your Highness

590
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,521
How can this be called persuasion

591
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,281
I don't like her strange appearance

592
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:02,440
Your Highness

593
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,081
Miss Yao has no yin and yang

594
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,160
This is how handmaidens serve their masters

595
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,960
One question and one answer

596
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,841
Be careful

597
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:09,081
Without the slightest trespass

598
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,680
What's wrong with it

599
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,281
What's wrong with it

600
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:14,361
I never treated her like a handmaiden

601
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,001
Go quickly

602
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,521
Go on

603
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:24,920
Your Highness

604
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:27,200
You see

605
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,480
Is the month

606
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,561
Your Highness takes tonic

607
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:39,880
You can't bait hot things

608
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,680
Eat early

609
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,041
Duck Soup with Coix Seed and Lotus Seeds

610
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,601
Change hibiscus meat and silver carp tofu

611
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,640
Apricot goose mixed with broom

612
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,880
Cut the roe

613
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Go and get her back

614
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:29,200
This time

615
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,841
Go for me

616
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:32,761
Yes

617
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,121
Pinellia ternata

618
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,001
Three spoonfuls

619
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:08,001
Gold tooth powder

620
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,880
Zi Jin

621
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Look at my craft

622
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,081
Is it good-looking

623
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,400
This is too expensive

624
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:38,640
The pattern is too dense

625
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:40,761
But it's still much better

626
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,601
Make persistent efforts

627
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,121
Meng Shang Shi

628
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,240
Mr. Chan

629
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,521
Meng Shang's food is polite

630
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,640
Mr. Yisheng

631
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,400
Shame and dare not

632
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,321
I vaguely remember when Han Ying entered the palace for training

633
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:16,001
You have served as a teacher

634
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:18,521
It's worthwhile to call you sir

635
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:19,880
I wonder if you are visiting today

636
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,960
But what do you want from the emperor and grandson

637
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:23,480
Today, Lord Yang entered the palace

638
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,281
Taste Miss Yao's Suzhou Pastry

639
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,281
Quite elegant

640
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:28,361
I want to ask your kitchen to copy it

641
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:29,960
I came here specially to ask for a prescription to go back

642
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,561
This is a trivial matter

643
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,561
I asked Zi Jin to write it and send it to me

644
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
Why do you come to the door in person

645
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,160
Then thank Meng Shang for eating

646
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:45,121
I'll send someone to pick it up later

647
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:46,400
Good

648
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,200
Mr. Chen walks slowly and doesn't send it

649
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,841
Please forgive me, Lord Shang Shi

650
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:04,041
I am also afraid of missing my son's good future

651
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:05,521
Serve people with color

652
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:06,640
When what a good future

653
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:11,880
It's good to be young and ignorant

654
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,801
Avoid a lot of sorrow

655
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,081
There are palace rules in the palace

656
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,601
Female officials have more dignity of female officials

657
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:19,680
I'm still in the food bureau for a day

658
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,041
He was sheltered by me for one day

659
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,640
There is no reason to take it away by force

660
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,281
Do such a senseless thing next time

661
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,480
I won't be lenient

662
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:28,121
Yes

663
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:44,680
It tastes wrong

664
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,001
Your Highness

665
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:49,521
Today's dish

666
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,001
It's exactly the same as yesterday

667
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:52,121
What's wrong

668
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:53,761
Try it yourself

669
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
How dare a handmaiden

670
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,321
Can't taste it

671
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,081
Your Highness, please make it clear

672
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
It's not that the dishes are wrong

673
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:18,920
It is your highness who is in a bad mood

674
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:20,920
Your Highness

675
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:22,321
The same food

676
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,920
Diners have different moods

677
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,121
The taste will be different

678
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,801
I think it's the cook who doesn't pay attention
