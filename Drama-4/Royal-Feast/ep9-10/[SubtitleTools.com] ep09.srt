1
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,119
Come and help me sort out my books

2
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Your Highness

3
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,399
Take stock of the grain in the world's military and civilian yamen

4
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,520
Check the number of annual cashiers

5
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,360
It's really tedious

6
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,479
Our department is already understaffed

7
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Sudden imperial edict

8
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,880
Isn't it a soup crab

9
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,440
Where are your hands and feet in disorder

10
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,279
Of course

11
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,440
Your Highness's orders

12
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,080
I must do it

13
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,919
It's just that the year is approaching

14
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,759
I also ask your highness to give you time

15
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,199
Rong Chen went back to draw up the articles of association

16
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,199
Come and report to your highness again

17
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,440
Your Highness

18
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,440
In fact, this government granary stores grain

19
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,279
There are reports everywhere

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,039
Just press the report for statistics

21
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,039
If you really want to send personnel to the field for verification,

22
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,440
On the selection of this personnel alone,

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,039
You need to think it over and over again

24
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,880
Scrutinize and scrutinize again

25
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,080
You must be cautious

26
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,440
According to my minister's opinion

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
Why don't you put it aside for a while

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Take a long-term view

29
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,679
Lord Song has a point

30
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,039
It's a pity that I met your majesty yesterday

31
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,000
He said eight months is too long

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
Only half a year was allowed

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,399
Then

34
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,039
Lord Song

35
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,520
Have a good time

36
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:53,919
Your Excellency

37
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,360
Please

38
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,119
I retire

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,839
What are you laughing at

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Are the books in order

41
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,079
Your Highness

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,239
Your Highness

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Handmaiden has doubts in his heart

44
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,679
Dare to ask

45
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,679
Your Highness, what is this painting

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,799
This is the fruit of tribute from Sumatra

47
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,119
It's called gambling

48
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,239
Grandpa Huang doesn't like its fragrance

49
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,720
But I tasted it once

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,640
It tastes very sweet

51
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,119
Dare to ask your highness

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,239
Where are the overseas countries

53
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,239
What kind of local conditions and customs are there

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,079
This is the homework of the Food Bureau

55
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,679
Make meal lists for overseas messengers

56
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,000
Listen to what you say

57
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,839
Seems eager to find a boat

58
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,959
Escape from overseas

59
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,279
There is no shortage of strange people in all dynasties

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,239
Enthusiastic about seeking immortals overseas

61
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,359
Fairy is not found

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,079
But there are a few logbooks

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,959
If you're interested

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,119
Self-seeking

65
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,359
Maybe on the travel notes side

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,399
Your Highness

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
Tai Sun Fei has been invited again

68
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:55,920
Your Highness

69
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,239
Take it

70
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,559
Your Highness will not come again tonight

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,959
Yes

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,920
Father-in-law Yuan

73
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,359
Tai Sun Fei

74
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,519
Your Highness is afraid that you will be empty

75
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,679
The extraordinary handmaiden came to report it

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
So

77
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,079
He's not coming again

78
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,119
The emperor recently detained his master to talk about government affairs

79
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,040
So your highness, he is too busy

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
When your highness is idle,

81
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,160
Be the first to think of you

82
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,399
You go

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,839
Tai Sun Fei

84
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,799
Brocade book

85
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,279
It's all my fault

86
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,839
I broke his heart

87
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
Walk with me for a while

88
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,640
If there is a person who disappoints you very much

89
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,040
She wants to repent now

90
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Will you forgive her

91
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,760
Why not answer

92
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Your Highness

93
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,320
Who has no fault

94
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,200
You can change it after passing it

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,279
Great goodness

96
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,519
You are a really strange person

97
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
You've done so much

98
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,760
See me but don't say anything

99
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
You know I'm talking about her

100
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,559
And let me see her

101
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,079
I'll let you go

102
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
Because you want to go

103
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,839
Your Highness is puzzled

104
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,320
Can't be released for a long time

105
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,760
How can this be fun

106
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,640
It's better to be open and ask for a peace of mind

107
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,200
Isn't it

108
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,519
In the Royal Family

109
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,359
Don't ask for a love that depends on life and death

110
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,200
But ask for a respectful wife

111
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,200
But I sat with her

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,919
Everyone feels uncomfortable

113
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,719
You said that in this world

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,960
Is there such a strange couple

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,359
Your heart is so sincere

116
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,400
Who in the world won't cherish it

117
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,039
As long as your highness treats each other sincerely

118
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,400
There will be a day when the clouds will be seen

119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,840
I went to see her

120
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,400
Are you really happy

121
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,200
Look at your worries

122
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,440
Think one's own worries

123
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,400
Your Highness shows his face

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
We are delighted

125
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,799
Your Highness is puzzled

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
Can't be released for a long time

127
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,960
How can this be fun

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,760
It's better to be open and ask for a peace of mind

129
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,239
Let's go to Hongqing Palace

130
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,320
Yes

131
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,119
Citizen's daughter greets His Royal Highness, Emperor Taisun

132
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,200
Your Highness

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,359
Taisunfei greets the Crown Princess

134
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,479
Will be back soon

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,719
Would your highness please sit down for a moment

136
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,479
This is Miss Hu Fuqi

137
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,119
Go to the palace to visit Tai Sun Fei

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,719
Your Highness is back

139
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier

140
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,880
You are talking to the Crown Princess

141
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,119
How dare a handmaiden disturb

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,599
Seven sisters

143
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Why are you here

144
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,640
Shan Yuan greets Tai Sun Fei

145
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,159
No one reported it before

146
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,119
What's going on

147
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,799
Why not answer

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,280
Previously, the crown princess gave her mother

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,599
The grace of visiting the palace

150
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,799
Now Tai Sun Fei is ill

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,119
Mother often misses

152
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,039
But the legs and feet are not flexible

153
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,239
He sent seven younger sisters into the palace to visit the sick

154
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
I am ill

155
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,599
What's wrong with me

156
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
Tai Sun Fei and Huang Tai Sun have been married for a long time

157
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,320
But there are no children for a long time

158
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,039
Not only do the crown princess miss it

159
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,799
Parents also often worry

160
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,200
Elder sister

161
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,919
I always think of my family

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
No matter how much I blame you and hate you

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,159
I also regard you as the only support in the palace

164
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,479
You're the only one I can trust

165
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,799
But only because I have no children

166
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,280
Can't win more honor for the Hu family

167
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,919
You guys

168
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,599
One by one, you

169
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,679
Why do you treat me so cruelly

170
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,200
Why

171
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,679
Say something

172
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,080
Third sister

173
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,880
No wonder your highness just came over

174
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,919
He left without looking back

175
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,679
He thought I was a wife

176
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,799
Unexpectedly for one's own selfish desires

177
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
Dedicate your sister to your husband

178
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,919
So as to flatter your mother's family

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,679
Sure

180
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,320
Since you all don't care about face

181
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,039
Then I will fulfill you

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,880
Bearer

183
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,799
Drag this bitch down

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
The staff is responsible for thirty

185
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,039
Expulsion from the palace

186
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Tai Sun Fei

187
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,799
This

188
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,919
Master

189
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,799
Tai Sun Fei

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
Please spare the handmaiden

191
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,200
Master

192
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:41,760
Master

193
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,159
Miss Big Save the Handmaiden

194
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,239
Handmaiden also listens to your orders

195
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,280
Handmaiden is obedient to orders

196
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,400
Master Jin Shu has followed you since childhood

197
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,559
But your closest handmaid

198
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,799
Such a person is for the Hu family

199
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,039
You can betray the maid who deceives your master at any time

200
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,919
I will never keep her

201
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,599
You take her out of the palace at once

202
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,840
From today

203
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
Without my orders

204
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,760
No one in the Hu family is allowed to enter the palace again

205
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,599
You listen up

206
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,400
From today

207
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,479
I want to live according to my own wishes

208
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Whether it's you

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,159
Or a father

210
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,039
If you disobey me again,

211
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't blame me for being ruthless

212
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
Elder sister

213
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,280
Third sister

214
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,080
How come the third sister is like a different person

215
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,599
It's good to change

216
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
If she's still the one she used to be

217
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,159
A muddled look

218
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,640
You can't live in this palace

219
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,119
This is the case now

220
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,440
It's like a great grandson

221
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,239
Let's go

222
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,280
I'll walk you out of the palace

223
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,239
Your Highness

224
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,559
Your Highness

225
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,840
Your Highness

226
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
Tai Sun Fei is still waiting outside

227
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,880
There is no need to report her news in the future

228
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,400
Yes, I know

229
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,479
Wait a minute

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,719
The handmaiden will invite Tai Sun Fei now

231
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,559
Your Highness

232
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,320
I'll I'll go

233
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,559
Tell her

234
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,919
The books are messed up

235
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,479
Tell her to come and rearrange it

236
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,000
Your Highness

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,880
I see

238
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,880
You go and tell me again

239
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,119
I have something urgent to see your highness

240
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,159
Tai Sun Fei

241
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,440
You know your highness's temper

242
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,960
The more you clamor to see him

243
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,239
The more unhappy he is

244
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,320
How about this

245
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,400
You go back first

246
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,520
When your highness is in good spirits,

247
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
You come and make amends yourself

248
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,400
This thing will be over

249
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,440
Master

250
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,479
It's windy here

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,159
Let's go back

252
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,719
I can't find any of the books I'm looking for

253
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,799
How did you organize it

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm asking you what I'm talking about

255
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,200
Your Highness

256
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,760
Asking me

257
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,640
Or are you asking a handmaiden

258
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,719
What's the difference

259
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,559
Your Highness is right

260
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,799
I am a handmaiden

261
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,640
What are you talking about

262
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,440
I persuaded the temple to go down to see Tai Sun Fei

263
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,359
His Highness vented his grievances on me

264
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,239
I think your highness should be aware

265
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,159
What I've done for you

266
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,599
Not a handmaiden will do it for his master

267
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,520
You

268
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,919
I am delighted with you

269
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
What I've done for you

270
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,840
It was done by a woman for a man she admired

271
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,960
To please your highness

272
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,319
I can endure loss

273
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,599
Even heartache

274
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,359
Persuade you to go to see Tai Sun Fei

275
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,800
But you

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
But I put the books I sorted out

277
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,079
Just give up like this

278
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,439
Your Highness didn't lose a book

279
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,680
It's my heart

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,439
You

281
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,959
How dare you speak to me like that

282
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,319
Your Highness

283
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:29,239
You treat me the way your master treats your handmaiden

284
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Then from now on

285
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,839
I can use it, too

286
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,239
The way handmaiden treats his master treats you

287
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,920
It's not my job to tidy up the study

288
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,719
Your Highness should be dissatisfied

289
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,920
But punishment is

290
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,439
If your highness has no other orders,

291
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,520
The handmaiden retired

292
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,719
What did she just say

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,319
She

294
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,640
She said she liked you

295
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,520
She said she would use the handmaiden way

296
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,880
To treat her master

297
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
Tell her to roll back

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,280
Go on

299
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,880
Rolling rolling

300
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,599
Rolling rolling

301
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,959
Your Highness told you to get back

302
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,760
Tell you to roll back

303
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,599
You're screwed. You're screwed

304
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,400
Your Highness
