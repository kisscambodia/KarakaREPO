1
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,239
Come and help me sort out my books

2
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,640
Your Highness

3
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,519
Take stock of the grain in the world's military and civilian yamen

4
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Check the number of annual cashiers

5
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,480
It's really tedious

6
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,599
Our department is already understaffed

7
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
Sudden imperial edict

8
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,000
Isn't it a soup crab

9
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,560
Where are your hands and feet in disorder

10
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,399
Of course

11
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
Your Highness's orders

12
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,200
I must do it

13
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,039
It's just that the year is approaching

14
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,879
I also ask your highness to give you time

15
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
Rong Chen went back to draw up the articles of association

16
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,319
Come and report to your highness again

17
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Your Highness

18
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,560
In fact, this government granary stores grain

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,399
There are reports everywhere

20
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
Just press the report for statistics

21
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:01,159
If you really want to send personnel to the field for verification,

22
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,560
On the selection of this personnel alone,

23
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,159
You need to think it over and over again

24
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,000
Scrutinize and scrutinize again

25
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,200
You must be cautious

26
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,560
According to my minister's opinion

27
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,440
Why don't you put it aside for a while

28
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,120
Take a long-term view

29
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,799
Lord Song has a point

30
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,159
It's a pity that I met your majesty yesterday

31
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,120
He said eight months is too long

32
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,440
Only half a year was allowed

33
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,519
Then

34
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,159
Lord Song

35
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:29,640
Have a good time

36
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,039
Your Excellency

37
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:33,480
Please

38
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,239
I retire

39
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,959
What are you laughing at

40
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
Are the books in order

41
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,199
Your Highness

42
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,359
Your Highness

43
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,280
Handmaiden has doubts in his heart

44
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,799
Dare to ask

45
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,799
Your Highness, what is this painting

46
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,919
This is the fruit of tribute from Sumatra

47
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,239
It's called gambling

48
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,359
Grandpa Huang doesn't like its fragrance

49
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,840
But I tasted it once

50
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,760
It tastes very sweet

51
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,239
Dare to ask your highness

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,359
Where are the overseas countries

53
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,359
What kind of local conditions and customs are there

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,199
This is the homework of the Food Bureau

55
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,799
Make meal lists for overseas messengers

56
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,120
Listen to what you say

57
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,959
Seems eager to find a boat

58
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,079
Escape from overseas

59
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,399
There is no shortage of strange people in all dynasties

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,359
Enthusiastic about seeking immortals overseas

61
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,479
Fairy is not found

62
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,199
But there are a few logbooks

63
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,079
If you're interested

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,239
Self-seeking

65
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,479
Maybe on the travel notes side

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,519
Your Highness

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,880
Tai Sun Fei has been invited again

68
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,040
Your Highness

69
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,359
Take it

70
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,679
Your Highness will not come again tonight

71
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,079
Yes

72
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,040
Father-in-law Yuan

73
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,479
Tai Sun Fei

74
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,639
Your Highness is afraid that you will be empty

75
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,799
The extraordinary handmaiden came to report it

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,560
So

77
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,199
He's not coming again

78
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,239
The emperor recently detained his master to talk about government affairs

79
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,160
So your highness, he is too busy

80
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,880
When your highness is idle,

81
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,280
Be the first to think of you

82
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,519
You go

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,959
Tai Sun Fei

84
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:32,919
Brocade book

85
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,399
It's all my fault

86
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,959
I broke his heart

87
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
Walk with me for a while

88
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,760
If there is a person who disappoints you very much

89
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,160
She wants to repent now

90
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,880
Will you forgive her

91
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,880
Why not answer

92
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,320
Your Highness

93
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,440
Who has no fault

94
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,320
You can change it after passing it

95
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,399
Great goodness

96
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,639
You are a really strange person

97
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
You've done so much

98
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,880
See me but don't say anything

99
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,280
You know I'm talking about her

100
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,679
And let me see her

101
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,199
I'll let you go

102
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,720
Because you want to go

103
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,959
Your Highness is puzzled

104
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,440
Can't be released for a long time

105
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,880
How can this be fun

106
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,760
It's better to be open and ask for a peace of mind

107
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,320
Isn't it

108
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,639
In the Royal Family

109
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,479
Don't ask for a love that depends on life and death

110
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,320
But ask for a respectful wife

111
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,320
But I sat with her

112
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,039
Everyone feels uncomfortable

113
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,839
You said that in this world

114
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,080
Is there such a strange couple

115
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,479
Your heart is so sincere

116
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,520
Who in the world won't cherish it

117
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,159
As long as your highness treats each other sincerely

118
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,520
There will be a day when the clouds will be seen

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,960
I went to see her

120
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,520
Are you really happy

121
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,320
Look at your worries

122
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,560
Think one's own worries

123
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,520
Your Highness shows his face

124
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
We are delighted

125
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,919
Your Highness is puzzled

126
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,000
Can't be released for a long time

127
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
How can this be fun

128
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,880
It's better to be open and ask for a peace of mind

129
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,359
Let's go to Hongqing Palace

130
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,440
Yes

131
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,239
Citizen's daughter greets His Royal Highness, Emperor Taisun

132
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,320
Your Highness

133
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,479
Taisunfei greets the Crown Princess

134
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,599
Will be back soon

135
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,839
Would your highness please sit down for a moment

136
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,599
This is Miss Hu Fuqi

137
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,239
Go to the palace to visit Tai Sun Fei

138
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,839
Your Highness is back

139
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,960
Why didn't you tell me earlier

140
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,000
You are talking to the Crown Princess

141
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,239
How dare a handmaiden disturb

142
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,719
Seven sisters

143
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,520
Why are you here

144
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,760
Shan Yuan greets Tai Sun Fei

145
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,279
No one reported it before

146
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,239
What's going on

147
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,919
Why not answer

148
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,400
Previously, the crown princess gave her mother

149
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,719
The grace of visiting the palace

150
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,919
Now Tai Sun Fei is ill

151
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,239
Mother often misses

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,159
But the legs and feet are not flexible

153
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,359
He sent seven younger sisters into the palace to visit the sick

154
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
I am ill

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,719
What's wrong with me

156
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,520
Tai Sun Fei and Huang Tai Sun have been married for a long time

157
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,440
But there are no children for a long time

158
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,159
Not only do the crown princess miss it

159
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,919
Parents also often worry

160
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,320
Elder sister

161
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,039
I always think of my family

162
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,760
No matter how much I blame you and hate you

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,279
I also regard you as the only support in the palace

164
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,599
You're the only one I can trust

165
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,919
But only because I have no children

166
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,400
Can't win more honor for the Hu family

167
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,039
You guys

168
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,719
One by one, you

169
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,799
Why do you treat me so cruelly

170
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,320
Why

171
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,799
Say something

172
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,200
Third sister

173
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,000
No wonder your highness just came over

174
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,039
He left without looking back

175
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,799
He thought I was a wife

176
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,919
Unexpectedly for one's own selfish desires

177
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,760
Dedicate your sister to your husband

178
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,039
So as to flatter your mother's family

179
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,799
Sure

180
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,440
Since you all don't care about face

181
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,159
Then I will fulfill you

182
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,000
Bearer

183
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:08,919
Drag this bitch down

184
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,520
The staff is responsible for thirty

185
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,159
Expulsion from the palace

186
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,440
Tai Sun Fei

187
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,919
This

188
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,039
Master

189
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:15,919
Tai Sun Fei

190
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
Please spare the handmaiden

191
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,320
Master

192
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:18,880
Master

193
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,279
Miss Big Save the Handmaiden

194
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,359
Handmaiden also listens to your orders

195
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,400
Handmaiden is obedient to orders

196
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,520
Master Jin Shu has followed you since childhood

197
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,679
But your closest handmaid

198
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,919
Such a person is for the Hu family

199
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,159
You can betray the maid who deceives your master at any time

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,039
I will never keep her

201
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,719
You take her out of the palace at once

202
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,960
From today

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,960
Without my orders

204
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,880
No one in the Hu family is allowed to enter the palace again

205
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,719
You listen up

206
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,520
From today

207
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,599
I want to live according to my own wishes

208
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Whether it's you

209
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,279
Or a father

210
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,159
If you disobey me again,

211
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,120
Don't blame me for being ruthless

212
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Elder sister

213
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,400
Third sister

214
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,200
How come the third sister is like a different person

215
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,719
It's good to change

216
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,080
If she's still the one she used to be

217
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,279
A muddled look

218
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,760
You can't live in this palace

219
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,239
This is the case now

220
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,560
It's like a great grandson

221
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,359
Let's go

222
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,400
I'll walk you out of the palace

223
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,359
Your Highness

224
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,679
Your Highness

225
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:55,960
Your Highness

226
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,080
Tai Sun Fei is still waiting outside

227
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,000
There is no need to report her news in the future

228
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,520
Yes, I know

229
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,599
Wait a minute

230
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,839
The handmaiden will invite Tai Sun Fei now

231
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,679
Your Highness

232
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,440
I'll I'll go

233
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:16,679
Tell her

234
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,039
The books are messed up

235
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,599
Tell her to come and rearrange it

236
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,120
Your Highness

237
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,000
I see

238
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,000
You go and tell me again

239
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,239
I have something urgent to see your highness

240
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,279
Tai Sun Fei

241
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,560
You know your highness's temper

242
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,080
The more you clamor to see him

243
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,359
The more unhappy he is

244
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,440
How about this

245
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,520
You go back first

246
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,640
When your highness is in good spirits,

247
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
You come and make amends yourself

248
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,520
This thing will be over

249
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,560
Master

250
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,599
It's windy here

251
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,279
Let's go back

252
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,839
I can't find any of the books I'm looking for

253
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,919
How did you organize it

254
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm asking you what I'm talking about

255
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,320
Your Highness

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
Asking me

257
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,760
Or are you asking a handmaiden

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,839
What's the difference

259
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,679
Your Highness is right

260
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,919
I am a handmaiden

261
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,760
What are you talking about

262
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,560
I persuaded the temple to go down to see Tai Sun Fei

263
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,479
His Highness vented his grievances on me

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,359
I think your highness should be aware

265
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,279
What I've done for you

266
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,719
Not a handmaiden will do it for his master

267
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:17,640
You

268
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,039
I am delighted with you

269
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
What I've done for you

270
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,960
It was done by a woman for a man she admired

271
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,080
To please your highness

272
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,439
I can endure loss

273
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,719
Even heartache

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,479
Persuade you to go to see Tai Sun Fei

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,920
But you

276
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,559
But I put the books I sorted out

277
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,199
Just give up like this

278
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,559
Your Highness didn't lose a book

279
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
It's my heart

280
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,559
You

281
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,079
How dare you speak to me like that

282
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,439
Your Highness

283
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,359
You treat me the way your master treats your handmaiden

284
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Then from now on

285
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,959
I can use it, too

286
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,359
The way handmaiden treats his master treats you

287
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,040
It's not my job to tidy up the study

288
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,839
Your Highness should be dissatisfied

289
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,040
But punishment is

290
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,559
If your highness has no other orders,

291
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,640
The handmaiden retired

292
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,839
What did she just say

293
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,439
She

294
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,760
She said she liked you

295
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,640
She said she would use the handmaiden way

296
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,000
To treat her master

297
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,920
Tell her to roll back

298
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,400
Go on

299
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Rolling rolling

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,719
Rolling rolling

301
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,079
Your Highness told you to get back

302
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Tell you to roll back

303
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,719
You're screwed. You're screwed

304
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,520
Your Highness

305
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,320
Why don't you use Tibetan fragrant pigs or mullet roe

306
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,401
No, no, no

307
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,480
Some people have used it

308
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,761
What else can I use

309
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:21,881
I have my own way

310
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,480
Really

311
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,480
You go

312
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:26,281
You go busy

313
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:27,801
Come on, come on, come on

314
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,840
Go ahead

315
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,121
You see

316
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:00,480
Why is she cutting cucumbers

317
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,121
This is not giving up

318
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,480
Are you here yet

319
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,881
Coming, coming

320
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:37,641
Taisun, please sit down

321
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:40,240
Father

322
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:41,600
I heard that you are ill

323
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:42,881
Can you please have a doctor too much

324
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,161
What disease is it

325
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,281
Headache

326
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,801
No

327
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:56,960
It's here

328
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:59,921
A gouge out of the heart

329
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,161
The whole bifurcation

330
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:04,240
Just

331
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:05,921
It all hurts

332
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:14,720
Since my father is ill,

333
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
You should rest assured of illness

334
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,641
Have any errands

335
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,041
Even if you tell your son

336
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,881
Seriously

337
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,560
Seriously

338
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,801
Good

339
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:40,681
Lord You

340
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:44,761
Don't be so serious

341
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,521
I'm not here to find fault today

342
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,080
Lord Liu entered the palace to meet him

343
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,240
I came to see the meal list prepared for the mission

344
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:51,600
I'm just leading the way

345
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,720
Meng Shang Shi

346
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:56,240
Last year, the meal list of Guanglu Temple was not suitable for taste

347
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,200
Almost caused trouble

348
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,921
This year, the prince gave orders

349
00:23:58,921 --> 00:23:59,840
To personally supervise

350
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,440
You can't be sloppy at all

351
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,440
Lord You has dealt with those people a lot

352
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,080
That's why he was asked to take a closer look

353
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,401
Your Excellencies

354
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,600
Please come with me

355
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,240
Delicious meat

356
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,560
But it's not greasy

357
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:36,281
It's completely different from the usual pork

358
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,080
Tibetan fragrant pigs sent by Wusi Zangdusi

359
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:40,960
What adults say is right

360
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:42,840
This kind of pig grows in mountains and forests

361
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,320
Drinking natural mountain springs

362
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:46,360
Eating wild people participate in pine mushrooms

363
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,641
So the meat is delicate and mellow

364
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,480
Fresh and tender

365
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,161
Handmaiden wants to

366
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,681
Most guests come from the sea

367
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,281
I have never tasted the delicious food in Tibet

368
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,840
This is how to cook soup with the spine of Tibetan fragrant pigs

369
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,281
The front legs are made of lion heads

370
00:24:59,001 --> 00:24:59,720
This kind of pork

371
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:01,600
No matter how it is cooked,

372
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:03,360
Are not disappointing

373
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,401
Well said

374
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
I am the only one in the world

375
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,240
Where can I find this ginseng pig again

376
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,480
It's so delicious

377
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,360
Good

378
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,921
With ginger pepper

379
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:24,401
Unripe fragrant floating nose

380
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Puffer fish is poisonous

381
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:28,240
River perch is ashamed and tasteless

382
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,560
Swordfish is indeed the first in Jiangxian

383
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,401
But now the spring season has not arrived

384
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,001
I used dried fish to send it away

385
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,840
I also used gold foil

386
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
This is the commonplace color

387
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,401
Wrapped in silk and silk

388
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,401
Is a peerless beauty

389
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Self-deception

390
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,281
Step down

391
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,240
Step down

392
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:23,161
Why add pepper to it

393
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,761
In my hometown

394
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,921
Pepper all the way from Sumatra

395
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:28,960
Shipped from Guri

396
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,121
Price is more precious than gold

397
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:35,521
Your Excellency

398
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,801
This is a tribute girl who has just arrived

399
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,480
Pepper is piled up in the library in China

400
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:41,801
But you judge people by their own merits

401
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,121
Offer such cheap things as treasures

402
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,360
Wouldn't it be disrespectful

403
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:46,761
Handmaiden has shallow knowledge

404
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:47,921
Please forgive me

405
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,360
What is the faux pas

406
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:00,521
The arrival of His Highness unknown

407
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:02,600
Please forgive me for the loss of welcome

408
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,480
It's a small matter to entertain guests

409
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,401
It's a big thing to lose the national system

410
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,480
I heard everything you said just now

411
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,801
All over the world

412
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:10,560
Murphy Wang Tu

413
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,521
Lead the shore of soil

414
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:12,200
Murphy Wang Chen

415
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,200
China began in Qin and Han Dynasties

416
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:18,080
He kept coming and going with the Gentiles

417
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:20,080
As for me, it is even more so

418
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Grandpa Huang's thousands of orders

419
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,240
Where does the caravan go

420
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,401
Whether by sea or land

421
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
You can't bully the widow, you can't bully the weak

422
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,440
Some places don't know the weather

423
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:31,801
He gave the calendar

424
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,080
Church farming

425
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,840
In some places banana leaves are used as food utensils

426
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,921
People can only eat cold food

427
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:40,121
It is necessary to open a ceramic mutual market

428
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,281
Give acupuncture herbs

429
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,080
In some places, etiquette and customs are impassable

430
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,001
Fighting constantly

431
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,801
We will quell the war

432
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,641
Our fleet brought it

433
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:51,881
It's not just gorgeous silk and porcelain

434
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,401
But also Chinese herbal medicines

435
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:55,840
Acupuncture weaving

436
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:58,001
Architectural navigation

437
00:27:58,641 --> 00:27:59,960
And a large number of Chinese classics

438
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:01,921
They all stay in overseas countries

439
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,560
Why are we doing this

440
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Just because of the scourge of widowhood

441
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,320
Then there was chaos

442
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:07,720
Only the world is peaceful

443
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:09,801
Then the people in the world can enjoy happiness

444
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,360
So

445
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:13,001
She doesn't understand. You have to tell her

446
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,681
And treat them equally

447
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,720
Your Highness, please forgive me

448
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:21,960
These children are confined to the deep palace and have limited horizons

449
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,960
Your Highness's lesson is better than my ten years' work

450
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,320
Remember today's words

451
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:30,200
A person should have a broad mind and vision

452
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,681
It will be good for you all your life

453
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,041
Yes

454
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,881
Step down

455
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,200
A kind of red shrimp is mentioned in the collections of Materia Medica in Tang Dynasty

456
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,200
Shenglinhai Huiji

457
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:48,681
The big one is a foot long

458
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:49,641
Must can be a hairpin

459
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,001
Just in line with Taiping County Records

460
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:54,521
Colorful giant shrimp with abnormal burly

461
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:55,440
Exactly the same

462
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
Therefore, it is also called God Shrimp in Quanzhou Prefecture

463
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,840
Today, the traditional practice of local fishermen is specially adopted

464
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,480
Cook splendid shrimp rice

465
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,041
Please ask noble people to taste it

466
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,521
Where is the meal

467
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,560
Your Highness doesn't know

468
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,200
Rice in fishermen's mouth

469
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,921
Often refers to fish and shrimp

470
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Shrimp meat dipped in sauce has unique flavor

471
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,840
It makes people feel like they are back in the bow

472
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,881
The moment when the sea breeze blows

473
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:41,200
Unspeakably relaxed and happy

474
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:45,360
Fresh and chewy

475
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,001
It's the smell of the sea

476
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:50,240
What do you say, Your Highness

477
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,840
Powder, waxy, sweet and endless aftertaste

478
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,161
Needless to say, betel nut and taro

479
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,240
Taro again

480
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,440
Crispy and sweet

481
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,161
Far better than steamed taro

482
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:02,801
Do two things with one impression

483
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Ordinary ingredients

484
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:06,041
Make an unusual taste

485
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:07,960
This is the craft

486
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:12,921
No matter how delicious it is

487
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,881
It's just some cut cucumbers

488
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,161
Fennel broad bean

489
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,401
Add a taro

490
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:18,840
Not even a shredded pork

491
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,320
Why is it so stingy

492
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,320
Are you going to win by quantity

493
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,641
Grandpa Huang asked his father to do errands

494
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,840
It happened that my father fell ill

495
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,320
But the emperor's life is the emperor's life

496
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,161
He is ill

497
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:08,281
Only I can come

498
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,840
Your Highness

499
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:13,560
Do you still need to ask the prince for instructions when you look at the meal list

500
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,401
Call the cook

501
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,480
Why use ordinary food

502
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:35,921
Back to your highness's words

503
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,001
Ancient cloud

504
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,600
It's a pleasure to have friends from afar

505
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,161
Entertain guests

506
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,320
It really should make them feel at home

507
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,560
But the people of our country are the most precious people

508
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,560
All the products of this land

509
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
It is a gift from God to the industrious people

510
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,201
They are the ones who should taste it most

511
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:57,641
And

512
00:34:57,641 --> 00:34:59,800
When Zhang Qian sent to the Western Regions,

513
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:02,080
Brought back the ingredients you used today

514
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,681
Precious seeds

515
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,401
Take root and sprout in the land of China

516
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,241
After being cultivated from generation to generation,

517
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,840
In order to change the ever-changing delicious food

518
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:12,921
Throw me a wooden peach

519
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:13,760
Reward it with Qiong Yao

520
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:16,681
Prepare a meal list for the mission

521
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:19,481
In addition to delicacies

522
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:21,000
Add these too

523
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,000
The rice I just ate

524
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:36,000
It's very soft and delicious

525
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:38,641
Jingshan Bridge Rice

526
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:41,080
Huguang suffered a natural disaster last year

527
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:43,320
If this kind of rice is supplied to the diplomatic corps,

528
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:45,320
So the wealthy businessmen in Beijing

529
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,800
Will compete for it

530
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:48,161
In this way

531
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,360
The life of the people will be much better

532
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:59,000
It's just a little chef

533
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:01,040
How to have so many thoughts

534
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,760
It's just a coincidence

535
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:06,161
How come he's back

536
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:07,961
Your Excellency

537
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,000
Please

538
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,201
Please

539
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,241
All the way

540
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,040
The opal brought back from Hurumus

541
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:21,201
See if you like it or not

542
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,080
Thank you for your reward

543
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,080
Handmaiden is ashamed and afraid to accept it

544
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:32,760
Line line line

545
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:35,441
Miss Yao

546
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,600
Haven't you been looking for it before

547
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,121
Is this log book

548
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:40,520
I sent it to you

549
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:42,201
I can't use it

550
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,921
Bring it all over

551
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:44,641
Keep it

552
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,401
Thank you for your handmaiden, Emperor Taisun, for your reward

553
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:53,921
Good

554
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,040
You tell her

555
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,360
One day

556
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:00,961
Our fleet brought it back

557
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,760
It won't be just jewelry and spices

558
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,360
There will be more products that benefit the Chinese people

559
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,280
It's over

560
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,840
I forgot the most important sentence

561
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,161
Walk, walk, walk

562
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,681
Reward

563
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:24,000
That's what she said

564
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:26,481
How dare that handmaiden reply indiscriminately

565
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,560
That's what Miss Yao said

566
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,560
Hurry up, hurry up

567
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,441
Come on, come on, come on

568
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,161
Quickly

569
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,921
Hurry up, hurry up

570
00:37:59,121 --> 00:37:59,760
Father-in-law Yuan

571
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,161
Thank you very much

572
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,241
Go in by yourself

573
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:06,600
Go on

574
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,401
Open

575
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:45,600
Yes

576
00:38:58,241 --> 00:38:59,040
What did you do today

577
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,481
Back to your highness's words

578
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:01,881
In accordance with established practice

579
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:03,760
Meal list from Guanglu Temple

580
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,241
The food bureau cooks according to the order

581
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,161
Yao Ziliao

582
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:13,241
Handmaiden is guilty, please punish your highness

583
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:14,881
What are your sins

584
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:17,401
Please show your highness that handmaiden is stupid

585
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,881
Get out of here

586
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,481
Handmaiden retires

587
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:29,881
You go and persuade her to come back

588
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,681
Don't come back if you can't persuade you to come back

589
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,201
Your Highness

590
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,641
How can this be called persuasion

591
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,401
I don't like her strange appearance

592
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:39,560
Your Highness

593
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,201
Miss Yao has no yin and yang

594
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,280
This is how handmaidens serve their masters

595
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,080
One question and one answer

596
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,961
Be careful

597
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:46,201
Without the slightest trespass

598
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,800
What's wrong with it

599
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,401
What's wrong with it

600
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,481
I never treated her like a handmaiden

601
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,121
Go quickly

602
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,641
Go on

603
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:02,040
Your Highness

604
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:04,320
You see

605
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,600
Is the month

606
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,681
Your Highness takes tonic

607
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:17,000
You can't bait hot things

608
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,800
Eat early

609
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:21,161
Duck Soup with Coix Seed and Lotus Seeds

610
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,721
Change hibiscus meat and silver carp tofu

611
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,760
Apricot goose mixed with broom

612
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,000
Cut the roe

613
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Go and get her back

614
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:06,320
This time

615
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,961
Go for me

616
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:09,881
Yes

617
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,241
Pinellia ternata

618
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,121
Three spoonfuls

619
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,121
Gold tooth powder

620
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,000
Zi Jin

621
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
Look at my craft

622
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,201
Is it good-looking

623
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,520
This is too expensive

624
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:15,760
The pattern is too dense

625
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:17,881
But it's still much better

626
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,721
Make persistent efforts

627
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,241
Meng Shang Shi

628
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,360
Mr. Chan

629
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,641
Meng Shang's food is polite

630
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,760
Mr. Yisheng

631
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,520
Shame and dare not

632
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,441
I vaguely remember when Han Ying entered the palace for training

633
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:53,121
You have served as a teacher

634
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:55,641
It's worthwhile to call you sir

635
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:57,000
I wonder if you are visiting today

636
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,080
But what do you want from the emperor and grandson

637
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:00,600
Today, Lord Yang entered the palace

638
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,401
Taste Miss Yao's Suzhou Pastry

639
00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:03,401
Quite elegant

640
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,481
I want to ask your kitchen to copy it

641
00:43:05,681 --> 00:43:07,080
I came here specially to ask for a prescription to go back

642
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,681
This is a trivial matter

643
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,681
I asked Zi Jin to write it and send it to me

644
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,520
Why do you come to the door in person

645
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,280
Then thank Meng Shang for eating

646
00:43:21,121 --> 00:43:22,241
I'll send someone to pick it up later

647
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:23,520
Good

648
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,320
Mr. Chen walks slowly and doesn't send it

649
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,961
Please forgive me, Lord Shang Shi

650
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:41,161
I am also afraid of missing my son's good future

651
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:42,641
Serve people with color

652
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:43,760
When what a good future

653
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:49,000
It's good to be young and ignorant

654
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,921
Avoid a lot of sorrow

655
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,201
There are palace rules in the palace

656
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,721
Female officials have more dignity of female officials

657
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:56,800
I'm still in the food bureau for a day

658
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,161
He was sheltered by me for one day

659
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,760
There is no reason to take it away by force

660
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,401
Do such a senseless thing next time

661
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,600
I won't be lenient

662
00:44:04,681 --> 00:44:05,241
Yes

663
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:21,800
It tastes wrong

664
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,121
Your Highness

665
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:26,641
Today's dish

666
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,121
It's exactly the same as yesterday

667
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:29,241
What's wrong

668
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:30,881
Try it yourself

669
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
How dare a handmaiden

670
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,441
Can't taste it

671
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,201
Your Highness, please make it clear

672
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
It's not that the dishes are wrong

673
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:56,040
It is your highness who is in a bad mood

674
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,040
Your Highness

675
00:44:58,481 --> 00:44:59,441
The same food

676
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,040
Diners have different moods

677
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,241
The taste will be different

678
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,921
I think it's the cook who doesn't pay attention
