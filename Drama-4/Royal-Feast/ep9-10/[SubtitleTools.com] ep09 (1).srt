1
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,119
Come and help me sort out my books

2
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Your Highness

3
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,399
Take stock of the grain in the world's military and civilian yamen

4
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,520
Check the number of annual cashiers

5
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,360
It's really tedious

6
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,479
Our department is already understaffed

7
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Sudden imperial edict

8
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,880
Isn't it a soup crab

9
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,440
Where are your hands and feet in disorder

10
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,279
Of course

11
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,440
Your Highness's orders

12
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,080
I must do it

13
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,919
It's just that the year is approaching

14
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,759
I also ask your highness to give you time

15
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,199
Rong Chen went back to draw up the articles of association

16
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,199
Come and report to your highness again

17
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,440
Your Highness

18
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,440
In fact, this government granary stores grain

19
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,279
There are reports everywhere

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,039
Just press the report for statistics

21
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,039
If you really want to send personnel to the field for verification,

22
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,440
On the selection of this personnel alone,

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,039
You need to think it over and over again

24
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,880
Scrutinize and scrutinize again

25
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,080
You must be cautious

26
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,440
According to my minister's opinion

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
Why don't you put it aside for a while

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Take a long-term view

29
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,679
Lord Song has a point

30
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,039
It's a pity that I met your majesty yesterday

31
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,000
He said eight months is too long

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
Only half a year was allowed

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,399
Then

34
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,039
Lord Song

35
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,520
Have a good time

36
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:53,919
Your Excellency

37
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,360
Please

38
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,119
I retire

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,839
What are you laughing at

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Are the books in order

41
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,079
Your Highness

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,239
Your Highness

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Handmaiden has doubts in his heart

44
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,679
Dare to ask

45
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,679
Your Highness, what is this painting

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,799
This is the fruit of tribute from Sumatra

47
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,119
It's called gambling

48
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,239
Grandpa Huang doesn't like its fragrance

49
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,720
But I tasted it once

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,640
It tastes very sweet

51
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,119
Dare to ask your highness

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,239
Where are the overseas countries

53
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,239
What kind of local conditions and customs are there

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,079
This is the homework of the Food Bureau

55
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,679
Make meal lists for overseas messengers

56
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,000
Listen to what you say

57
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,839
Seems eager to find a boat

58
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,959
Escape from overseas

59
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,279
There is no shortage of strange people in all dynasties

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,239
Enthusiastic about seeking immortals overseas

61
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,359
Fairy is not found

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,079
But there are a few logbooks

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,959
If you're interested

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,119
Self-seeking

65
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,359
Maybe on the travel notes side

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,399
Your Highness

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
Tai Sun Fei has been invited again

68
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:55,920
Your Highness

69
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,239
Take it

70
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,559
Your Highness will not come again tonight

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,959
Yes

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,920
Father-in-law Yuan

73
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,359
Tai Sun Fei

74
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,519
Your Highness is afraid that you will be empty

75
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,679
The extraordinary handmaiden came to report it

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
So

77
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,079
He's not coming again

78
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,119
The emperor recently detained his master to talk about government affairs

79
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,040
So your highness, he is too busy

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
When your highness is idle,

81
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,160
Be the first to think of you

82
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,399
You go

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,839
Tai Sun Fei

84
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,799
Brocade book

85
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,279
It's all my fault

86
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,839
I broke his heart

87
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
Walk with me for a while

88
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,640
If there is a person who disappoints you very much

89
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,040
She wants to repent now

90
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Will you forgive her

91
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,760
Why not answer

92
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Your Highness

93
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,320
Who has no fault

94
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,200
You can change it after passing it

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,279
Great goodness

96
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,519
You are a really strange person

97
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
You've done so much

98
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,760
See me but don't say anything

99
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
You know I'm talking about her

100
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,559
And let me see her

101
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,079
I'll let you go

102
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
Because you want to go

103
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,839
Your Highness is puzzled

104
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,320
Can't be released for a long time

105
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,760
How can this be fun

106
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,640
It's better to be open and ask for a peace of mind

107
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,200
Isn't it

108
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,519
In the Royal Family

109
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,359
Don't ask for a love that depends on life and death

110
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,200
But ask for a respectful wife

111
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,200
But I sat with her

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,919
Everyone feels uncomfortable

113
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,719
You said that in this world

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,960
Is there such a strange couple

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,359
Your heart is so sincere

116
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,400
Who in the world won't cherish it

117
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,039
As long as your highness treats each other sincerely

118
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,400
There will be a day when the clouds will be seen

119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,840
I went to see her

120
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,400
Are you really happy

121
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,200
Look at your worries

122
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,440
Think one's own worries

123
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,400
Your Highness shows his face

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
We are delighted

125
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,799
Your Highness is puzzled

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
Can't be released for a long time

127
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,960
How can this be fun

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,760
It's better to be open and ask for a peace of mind

129
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,239
Let's go to Hongqing Palace

130
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,320
Yes

131
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,119
Citizen's daughter greets His Royal Highness, Emperor Taisun

132
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,200
Your Highness

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,359
Taisunfei greets the Crown Princess

134
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,479
Will be back soon

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,719
Would your highness please sit down for a moment

136
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,479
This is Miss Hu Fuqi

137
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,119
Go to the palace to visit Tai Sun Fei

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,719
Your Highness is back

139
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier

140
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,880
You are talking to the Crown Princess

141
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,119
How dare a handmaiden disturb

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,599
Seven sisters

143
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Why are you here

144
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,640
Shan Yuan greets Tai Sun Fei

145
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,159
No one reported it before

146
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,119
What's going on

147
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,799
Why not answer

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,280
Previously, the crown princess gave her mother

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,599
The grace of visiting the palace

150
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,799
Now Tai Sun Fei is ill

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,119
Mother often misses

152
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,039
But the legs and feet are not flexible

153
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,239
He sent seven younger sisters into the palace to visit the sick

154
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
I am ill

155
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,599
What's wrong with me

156
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
Tai Sun Fei and Huang Tai Sun have been married for a long time

157
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,320
But there are no children for a long time

158
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,039
Not only do the crown princess miss it

159
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,799
Parents also often worry

160
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,200
Elder sister

161
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,919
I always think of my family

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
No matter how much I blame you and hate you

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,159
I also regard you as the only support in the palace

164
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,479
You're the only one I can trust

165
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,799
But only because I have no children

166
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,280
Can't win more honor for the Hu family

167
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,919
You guys

168
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,599
One by one, you

169
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,679
Why do you treat me so cruelly

170
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,200
Why

171
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,679
Say something

172
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,080
Third sister

173
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,880
No wonder your highness just came over

174
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,919
He left without looking back

175
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,679
He thought I was a wife

176
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,799
Unexpectedly for one's own selfish desires

177
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
Dedicate your sister to your husband

178
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,919
So as to flatter your mother's family

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,679
Sure

180
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,320
Since you all don't care about face

181
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,039
Then I will fulfill you

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,880
Bearer

183
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,799
Drag this bitch down

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
The staff is responsible for thirty

185
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,039
Expulsion from the palace

186
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Tai Sun Fei

187
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,799
This

188
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,919
Master

189
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,799
Tai Sun Fei

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
Please spare the handmaiden

191
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,200
Master

192
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:41,760
Master

193
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,159
Miss Big Save the Handmaiden

194
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,239
Handmaiden also listens to your orders

195
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,280
Handmaiden is obedient to orders

196
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,400
Master Jin Shu has followed you since childhood

197
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,559
But your closest handmaid

198
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,799
Such a person is for the Hu family

199
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,039
You can betray the maid who deceives your master at any time

200
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,919
I will never keep her

201
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,599
You take her out of the palace at once

202
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,840
From today

203
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
Without my orders

204
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,760
No one in the Hu family is allowed to enter the palace again

205
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,599
You listen up

206
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,400
From today

207
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,479
I want to live according to my own wishes

208
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Whether it's you

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,159
Or a father

210
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,039
If you disobey me again,

211
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't blame me for being ruthless

212
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
Elder sister

213
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,280
Third sister

214
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,080
How come the third sister is like a different person

215
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,599
It's good to change

216
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
If she's still the one she used to be

217
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,159
A muddled look

218
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,640
You can't live in this palace

219
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,119
This is the case now

220
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,440
It's like a great grandson

221
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,239
Let's go

222
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,280
I'll walk you out of the palace

223
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,239
Your Highness

224
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,559
Your Highness

225
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,840
Your Highness

226
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
Tai Sun Fei is still waiting outside

227
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,880
There is no need to report her news in the future

228
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,400
Yes, I know

229
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,479
Wait a minute

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,719
The handmaiden will invite Tai Sun Fei now

231
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,559
Your Highness

232
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,320
I'll I'll go

233
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,559
Tell her

234
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,919
The books are messed up

235
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,479
Tell her to come and rearrange it

236
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,000
Your Highness

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,880
I see

238
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,880
You go and tell me again

239
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,119
I have something urgent to see your highness

240
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,159
Tai Sun Fei

241
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,440
You know your highness's temper

242
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,960
The more you clamor to see him

243
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,239
The more unhappy he is

244
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,320
How about this

245
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,400
You go back first

246
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,520
When your highness is in good spirits,

247
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
You come and make amends yourself

248
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,400
This thing will be over

249
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,440
Master

250
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,479
It's windy here

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,159
Let's go back

252
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,719
I can't find any of the books I'm looking for

253
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,799
How did you organize it

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm asking you what I'm talking about

255
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,200
Your Highness

256
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,760
Asking me

257
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,640
Or are you asking a handmaiden

258
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,719
What's the difference

259
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,559
Your Highness is right

260
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,799
I am a handmaiden

261
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,640
What are you talking about

262
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,440
I persuaded the temple to go down to see Tai Sun Fei

263
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,359
His Highness vented his grievances on me

264
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,239
I think your highness should be aware

265
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,159
What I've done for you

266
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,599
Not a handmaiden will do it for his master

267
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,520
You

268
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,919
I am delighted with you

269
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
What I've done for you

270
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,840
It was done by a woman for a man she admired

271
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,960
To please your highness

272
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,319
I can endure loss

273
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,599
Even heartache

274
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,359
Persuade you to go to see Tai Sun Fei

275
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,800
But you

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
But I put the books I sorted out

277
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,079
Just give up like this

278
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,439
Your Highness didn't lose a book

279
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,680
It's my heart

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,439
You

281
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,959
How dare you speak to me like that

282
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,319
Your Highness

283
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:29,239
You treat me the way your master treats your handmaiden

284
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Then from now on

285
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,839
I can use it, too

286
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,239
The way handmaiden treats his master treats you

287
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,920
It's not my job to tidy up the study

288
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,719
Your Highness should be dissatisfied

289
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,920
But punishment is

290
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,439
If your highness has no other orders,

291
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,520
The handmaiden retired

292
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,719
What did she just say

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,319
She

294
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,640
She said she liked you

295
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,520
She said she would use the handmaiden way

296
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,880
To treat her master

297
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
Tell her to roll back

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,280
Go on

299
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,880
Rolling rolling

300
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,599
Rolling rolling

301
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,959
Your Highness told you to get back

302
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,760
Tell you to roll back

303
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,599
You're screwed. You're screwed

304
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,400
Your Highness

305
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,200
Why don't you use Tibetan fragrant pigs or mullet roe

306
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,281
No, no, no

307
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:35,360
Some people have used it

308
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,641
What else can I use

309
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:39,761
I have my own way

310
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,360
Really

311
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,360
You go

312
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:44,161
You go busy

313
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:45,681
Come on, come on, come on

314
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,720
Go ahead

315
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,001
You see

316
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:18,360
Why is she cutting cucumbers

317
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,001
This is not giving up

318
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:34,360
Are you here yet

319
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,761
Coming, coming

320
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:55,521
Taisun, please sit down

321
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:58,120
Father

322
00:21:58,641 --> 00:21:59,480
I heard that you are ill

323
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:00,761
Can you please have a doctor too much

324
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,041
What disease is it

325
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:09,161
Headache

326
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,681
No

327
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,840
It's here

328
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,801
A gouge out of the heart

329
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,041
The whole bifurcation

330
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,120
Just

331
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:23,801
It all hurts

332
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,600
Since my father is ill,

333
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,080
You should rest assured of illness

334
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,521
Have any errands

335
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:37,921
Even if you tell your son

336
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,761
Seriously

337
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,440
Seriously

338
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,681
Good

339
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:58,561
Lord You

340
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,641
Don't be so serious

341
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,401
I'm not here to find fault today

342
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:05,960
Lord Liu entered the palace to meet him

343
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,120
I came to see the meal list prepared for the mission

344
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm just leading the way

345
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,600
Meng Shang Shi

346
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:14,120
Last year, the meal list of Guanglu Temple was not suitable for taste

347
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,080
Almost caused trouble

348
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,801
This year, the prince gave orders

349
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:17,720
To personally supervise

350
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,320
You can't be sloppy at all

351
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:23,320
Lord You has dealt with those people a lot

352
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,960
That's why he was asked to take a closer look

353
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:28,281
Your Excellencies

354
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,480
Please come with me

355
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,120
Delicious meat

356
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,440
But it's not greasy

357
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,161
It's completely different from the usual pork

358
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
Tibetan fragrant pigs sent by Wusi Zangdusi

359
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,840
What adults say is right

360
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,720
This kind of pig grows in mountains and forests

361
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:02,200
Drinking natural mountain springs

362
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,240
Eating wild people participate in pine mushrooms

363
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,521
So the meat is delicate and mellow

364
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:07,360
Fresh and tender

365
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,041
Handmaiden wants to

366
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,561
Most guests come from the sea

367
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,161
I have never tasted the delicious food in Tibet

368
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,720
This is how to cook soup with the spine of Tibetan fragrant pigs

369
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,161
The front legs are made of lion heads

370
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:17,600
This kind of pork

371
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:19,480
No matter how it is cooked,

372
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:21,240
Are not disappointing

373
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:23,281
Well said

374
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,120
I am the only one in the world

375
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,120
Where can I find this ginseng pig again

376
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,360
It's so delicious

377
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,240
Good

378
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,801
With ginger pepper

379
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,281
Unripe fragrant floating nose

380
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Puffer fish is poisonous

381
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,120
River perch is ashamed and tasteless

382
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
Swordfish is indeed the first in Jiangxian

383
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,281
But now the spring season has not arrived

384
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,881
I used dried fish to send it away

385
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,720
I also used gold foil

386
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,360
This is the commonplace color

387
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,281
Wrapped in silk and silk

388
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:03,281
Is a peerless beauty

389
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Self-deception

390
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,161
Step down

391
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,120
Step down

392
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,041
Why add pepper to it

393
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,641
In my hometown

394
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,801
Pepper all the way from Sumatra

395
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:46,840
Shipped from Guri

396
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,001
Price is more precious than gold

397
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,401
Your Excellency

398
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,681
This is a tribute girl who has just arrived

399
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,360
Pepper is piled up in the library in China

400
00:25:58,561 --> 00:25:59,681
But you judge people by their own merits

401
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,001
Offer such cheap things as treasures

402
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:03,240
Wouldn't it be disrespectful

403
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,641
Handmaiden has shallow knowledge

404
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:05,801
Please forgive me

405
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,240
What is the faux pas

406
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,401
The arrival of His Highness unknown

407
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:20,480
Please forgive me for the loss of welcome

408
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:22,360
It's a small matter to entertain guests

409
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,281
It's a big thing to lose the national system

410
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:26,360
I heard everything you said just now

411
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,681
All over the world

412
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:28,440
Murphy Wang Tu

413
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,401
Lead the shore of soil

414
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:30,080
Murphy Wang Chen

415
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:33,080
China began in Qin and Han Dynasties

416
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,960
He kept coming and going with the Gentiles

417
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,960
As for me, it is even more so

418
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,120
Grandpa Huang's thousands of orders

419
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,120
Where does the caravan go

420
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,281
Whether by sea or land

421
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,200
You can't bully the widow, you can't bully the weak

422
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,320
Some places don't know the weather

423
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:49,681
He gave the calendar

424
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,960
Church farming

425
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:53,720
In some places banana leaves are used as food utensils

426
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,801
People can only eat cold food

427
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:58,001
It is necessary to open a ceramic mutual market

428
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,161
Give acupuncture herbs

429
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,960
In some places, etiquette and customs are impassable

430
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:03,881
Fighting constantly

431
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,681
We will quell the war

432
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,521
Our fleet brought it

433
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:09,761
It's not just gorgeous silk and porcelain

434
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:12,281
But also Chinese herbal medicines

435
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:13,720
Acupuncture weaving

436
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:15,881
Architectural navigation

437
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:17,840
And a large number of Chinese classics

438
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:19,801
They all stay in overseas countries

439
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Why are we doing this

440
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Just because of the scourge of widowhood

441
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,200
Then there was chaos

442
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,600
Only the world is peaceful

443
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,681
Then the people in the world can enjoy happiness

444
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,240
So

445
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,881
She doesn't understand. You have to tell her

446
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,561
And treat them equally

447
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
Your Highness, please forgive me

448
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,840
These children are confined to the deep palace and have limited horizons

449
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,840
Your Highness's lesson is better than my ten years' work

450
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,200
Remember today's words

451
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:48,080
A person should have a broad mind and vision

452
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,561
It will be good for you all your life

453
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,921
Yes

454
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,761
Step down

455
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,080
A kind of red shrimp is mentioned in the collections of Materia Medica in Tang Dynasty

456
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:05,080
Shenglinhai Huiji

457
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:06,561
The big one is a foot long

458
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:07,521
Must can be a hairpin

459
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,881
Just in line with Taiping County Records

460
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,401
Colorful giant shrimp with abnormal burly

461
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:13,320
Exactly the same

462
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,360
Therefore, it is also called God Shrimp in Quanzhou Prefecture

463
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,720
Today, the traditional practice of local fishermen is specially adopted

464
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,360
Cook splendid shrimp rice

465
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:22,921
Please ask noble people to taste it

466
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,401
Where is the meal

467
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:27,440
Your Highness doesn't know

468
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,080
Rice in fishermen's mouth

469
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,801
Often refers to fish and shrimp

470
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Shrimp meat dipped in sauce has unique flavor

471
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,720
It makes people feel like they are back in the bow

472
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,761
The moment when the sea breeze blows

473
00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:59,080
Unspeakably relaxed and happy

474
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:03,240
Fresh and chewy

475
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:04,881
It's the smell of the sea

476
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:08,120
What do you say, Your Highness

477
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:23,720
Powder, waxy, sweet and endless aftertaste

478
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,041
Needless to say, betel nut and taro

479
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,120
Taro again

480
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,320
Crispy and sweet

481
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,041
Far better than steamed taro

482
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:20,681
Do two things with one impression

483
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Ordinary ingredients

484
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,921
Make an unusual taste

485
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,840
This is the craft

486
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,801
No matter how delicious it is

487
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,761
It's just some cut cucumbers

488
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,041
Fennel broad bean

489
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,281
Add a taro

490
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:36,720
Not even a shredded pork

491
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,200
Why is it so stingy

492
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,200
Are you going to win by quantity

493
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,521
Grandpa Huang asked his father to do errands

494
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,720
It happened that my father fell ill

495
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,200
But the emperor's life is the emperor's life

496
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,041
He is ill

497
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,161
Only I can come

498
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,720
Your Highness

499
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:31,440
Do you still need to ask the prince for instructions when you look at the meal list

500
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,281
Call the cook

501
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:52,360
Why use ordinary food

502
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:53,801
Back to your highness's words

503
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,881
Ancient cloud

504
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,480
It's a pleasure to have friends from afar

505
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,041
Entertain guests

506
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,200
It really should make them feel at home

507
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,440
But the people of our country are the most precious people

508
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,440
All the products of this land

509
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
It is a gift from God to the industrious people

510
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,081
They are the ones who should taste it most

511
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:15,521
And

512
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,680
When Zhang Qian sent to the Western Regions,

513
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,960
Brought back the ingredients you used today

514
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,561
Precious seeds

515
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,281
Take root and sprout in the land of China

516
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:26,121
After being cultivated from generation to generation,

517
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,720
In order to change the ever-changing delicious food

518
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:30,801
Throw me a wooden peach

519
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:31,640
Reward it with Qiong Yao

520
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:34,561
Prepare a meal list for the mission

521
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:37,361
In addition to delicacies

522
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:38,880
Add these too

523
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,880
The rice I just ate

524
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:53,880
It's very soft and delicious

525
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:56,521
Jingshan Bridge Rice

526
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:58,960
Huguang suffered a natural disaster last year

527
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,200
If this kind of rice is supplied to the diplomatic corps,

528
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,200
So the wealthy businessmen in Beijing

529
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,680
Will compete for it

530
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:06,041
In this way

531
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,240
The life of the people will be much better

532
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,880
It's just a little chef

533
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,920
How to have so many thoughts

534
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:20,640
It's just a coincidence

535
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:24,041
How come he's back

536
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:25,841
Your Excellency

537
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,880
Please

538
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:28,081
Please

539
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,121
All the way

540
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,920
The opal brought back from Hurumus

541
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:39,081
See if you like it or not

542
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,960
Thank you for your reward

543
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:44,960
Handmaiden is ashamed and afraid to accept it

544
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:50,640
Line line line

545
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:53,321
Miss Yao

546
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,480
Haven't you been looking for it before

547
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,001
Is this log book

548
00:35:57,561 --> 00:35:58,400
I sent it to you

549
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:00,081
I can't use it

550
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,801
Bring it all over

551
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:02,521
Keep it

552
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,281
Thank you for your handmaiden, Emperor Taisun, for your reward

553
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:11,801
Good

554
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,920
You tell her

555
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,240
One day

556
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:18,841
Our fleet brought it back

557
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,640
It won't be just jewelry and spices

558
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,240
There will be more products that benefit the Chinese people

559
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,160
It's over

560
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,720
I forgot the most important sentence

561
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,041
Walk, walk, walk

562
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,561
Reward

563
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:41,880
That's what she said

564
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,361
How dare that handmaiden reply indiscriminately

565
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,440
That's what Miss Yao said

566
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,440
Hurry up, hurry up

567
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,321
Come on, come on, come on

568
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,041
Quickly

569
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,801
Hurry up, hurry up

570
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:17,640
Father-in-law Yuan

571
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,041
Thank you very much

572
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,121
Go in by yourself

573
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:24,480
Go on

574
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,281
Open

575
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:03,480
Yes

576
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:16,920
What did you do today

577
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,361
Back to your highness's words

578
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:19,761
In accordance with established practice

579
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,640
Meal list from Guanglu Temple

580
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,121
The food bureau cooks according to the order

581
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:25,041
Yao Ziliao

582
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:31,121
Handmaiden is guilty, please punish your highness

583
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:32,761
What are your sins

584
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:35,281
Please show your highness that handmaiden is stupid

585
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,761
Get out of here

586
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,361
Handmaiden retires

587
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:47,761
You go and persuade her to come back

588
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,561
Don't come back if you can't persuade you to come back

589
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,081
Your Highness

590
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,521
How can this be called persuasion

591
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,281
I don't like her strange appearance

592
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:57,440
Your Highness

593
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,081
Miss Yao has no yin and yang

594
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,160
This is how handmaidens serve their masters

595
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,960
One question and one answer

596
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,841
Be careful

597
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,081
Without the slightest trespass

598
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:05,680
What's wrong with it

599
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:07,281
What's wrong with it

600
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:09,361
I never treated her like a handmaiden

601
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,001
Go quickly

602
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,521
Go on

603
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:19,920
Your Highness

604
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:22,200
You see

605
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,480
Is the month

606
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,561
Your Highness takes tonic

607
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,880
You can't bait hot things

608
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,680
Eat early

609
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,041
Duck Soup with Coix Seed and Lotus Seeds

610
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,601
Change hibiscus meat and silver carp tofu

611
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,640
Apricot goose mixed with broom

612
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,880
Cut the roe

613
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Go and get her back

614
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:24,200
This time

615
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,841
Go for me

616
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:27,761
Yes

617
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,121
Pinellia ternata

618
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,001
Three spoonfuls

619
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,001
Gold tooth powder

620
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,880
Zi Jin

621
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Look at my craft

622
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,081
Is it good-looking

623
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,400
This is too expensive

624
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:33,640
The pattern is too dense

625
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:35,761
But it's still much better

626
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,601
Make persistent efforts

627
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,121
Meng Shang Shi

628
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,240
Mr. Chan

629
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,521
Meng Shang's food is polite

630
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,640
Mr. Yisheng

631
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,400
Shame and dare not

632
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,321
I vaguely remember when Han Ying entered the palace for training

633
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,001
You have served as a teacher

634
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,521
It's worthwhile to call you sir

635
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,880
I wonder if you are visiting today

636
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,960
But what do you want from the emperor and grandson

637
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:18,480
Today, Lord Yang entered the palace

638
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,281
Taste Miss Yao's Suzhou Pastry

639
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,281
Quite elegant

640
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:23,361
I want to ask your kitchen to copy it

641
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:24,960
I came here specially to ask for a prescription to go back

642
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,561
This is a trivial matter

643
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:29,561
I asked Zi Jin to write it and send it to me

644
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,400
Why do you come to the door in person

645
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,160
Then thank Meng Shang for eating

646
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,121
I'll send someone to pick it up later

647
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:41,400
Good

648
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,200
Mr. Chen walks slowly and doesn't send it

649
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,841
Please forgive me, Lord Shang Shi

650
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:59,041
I am also afraid of missing my son's good future

651
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:00,521
Serve people with color

652
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:01,640
When what a good future

653
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:06,880
It's good to be young and ignorant

654
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,801
Avoid a lot of sorrow

655
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,081
There are palace rules in the palace

656
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,601
Female officials have more dignity of female officials

657
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:14,680
I'm still in the food bureau for a day

658
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,041
He was sheltered by me for one day

659
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,640
There is no reason to take it away by force

660
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,281
Do such a senseless thing next time

661
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,480
I won't be lenient

662
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:23,121
Yes

663
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:39,680
It tastes wrong

664
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,001
Your Highness

665
00:43:43,561 --> 00:43:44,521
Today's dish

666
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,001
It's exactly the same as yesterday

667
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:47,121
What's wrong

668
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:48,761
Try it yourself

669
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
How dare a handmaiden

670
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,321
Can't taste it

671
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,081
Your Highness, please make it clear

672
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
It's not that the dishes are wrong

673
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:13,920
It is your highness who is in a bad mood

674
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,920
Your Highness

675
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,321
The same food

676
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,920
Diners have different moods

677
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,121
The taste will be different

678
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,801
I think it's the cook who doesn't pay attention
