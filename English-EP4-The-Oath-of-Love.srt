00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,120
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence!

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,625
I was looking for you.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Dr. Gu, I think you're a very good

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,160
and responsible doctor.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,395
I don't know

23
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,475
what happened to me before,

24
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,825
but I took leave of my sense,

25
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,425
and I said something strange

26
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:49,650
and stupid to you.

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,800
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,975
I won't say that again.

29
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,100
Our Dr. Gu is a…

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,550
It's dangerous to walk
like this in the hospital.

31
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,850
Please walk properly.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,839
Okay.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,525
Our Dr. Gu cares so much

34
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:02,500
about our patients' family.

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,480
Dr. Gu.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,850
I know you must have a reason

37
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,550
why you can't do the surgery,

38
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,675
but do tell.

39
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:09,425
If you tell me,
we can solve it together.

40
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:10,800
- If you don't, how are we…?
- Hey, Du.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,559
- Dr. Gu, anything I can do for you?
- Oh, right.

42
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,925
Bed 25 needs to have
the medication changed.

43
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,279
Bed 45 needs to have
the drainage tube removed.

44
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,119
Bed 46 needs to be discharged.

45
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,000
Have you done them all?

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,900
Of course, Dr. Gu.

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,300
You've already told me

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,960
when you're on your ward rounds.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,700
You told me to take care of them soon.

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,880
I've already done it

51
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,679
and submitted all the records
to the nurse station.

52
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,750
I know

53
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,199
I told you this morning.

54
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,650
I'm just reminding you

55
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,210
so you don't make any mistakes.

56
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,399
And,

57
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,700
have you written the index of the paper

58
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,559
I asked you to write?

59
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,880
Not only is there
a problem with the index,

60
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,839
but there are also
many omissions in your literature.

61
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,950
I've rewritten it all.

62
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:41,759
What's wrong with you today?
You didn't sleep well?

63
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,600
Last night in the office,

64
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,975
you guided me to correct my paper.

65
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,425
Very well.

66
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,625
Did you eat?

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,475
What did you eat?

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,275
Wei, don't scare me.

69
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,850
Did I do something wrong?

70
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,199
Just tell me.

71
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,800
What are you talking about?

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,450
I'm just caring about

73
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,689
your daily life.

74
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,039
Thank you for your care, Dr. Gu.

75
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm assisting Dr. Chen's surgery.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,125
I need to get ready for it.

77
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,300
I really need to go.

78
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,199
Sure, go.

79
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:16,775
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

80
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh, right, Xiaowei…

81
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,125
Dr. Du is not available,

82
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,671
but I am, Dr. Gu.

83
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Lin Zhixiao.

84
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,399
Your father doesn't need you
to take care of him today?

85
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,800
- Do you have a lot of time?
- Yes.

86
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,375
Don't waste time on me.

87
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,250
Dr. Gu.

88
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,750
Mr. Lin is in very good condition.

89
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,470
I have plenty of time.

90
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,450
- You have nothing to do, right?
- Yes.

91
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,520
I'm suddenly hungry.

92
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Get me something to eat.

93
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,350
The whole wheat bread
I bought this morning.

94
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,430
Please enjoy it, Dr. Gu.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,950
I'm thirsty and I don't want to eat.

96
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,225
Taken care of that, too.

97
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,679
The cup has been sanitized

98
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,100
and has wolfberries in it.

99
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,250
I made it myself.

100
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,975
I'm not thirsty now either.

101
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,350
Where do you want to go?

102
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,350
I'm coming with you, Dr. Gu.

103
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,199
Dr. Gu.

104
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,450
Wait for me.

105
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,075
Where are you going?

106
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,675
Coming inside?

107
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,279
No, no.

108
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,675
Suit yourself, Dr. Gu.

109
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,479
I'll wait for you at the door, Dr. Gu.

110
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,600
No rush. Take your time.

111
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:31,440
Hello, Director.

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,250
Mm.

113
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,975
Please, please.

114
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,425
Director.

115
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:03,799
Gu.

116
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,175
This is a hospital.

117
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,600
Watch your actions.

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
The girl outside,

119
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,650
don't tell me she's your ex.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,575
I see you're avoiding her.

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,500
Director,

122
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:17,550
she's just a patient's family.

123
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,625
I can't operate on her father

124
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,040
and she keeps asking questions,

125
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,359
so I'm avoiding her now.

126
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,440
A patient's family?

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,950
You don't have to be so afraid of her.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,550
I'm not afraid of her, I…

129
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,839
In our hospital,

130
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,640
there are other surgeons

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,359
besides you.

132
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,320
You are not obliged

133
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,000
to operate on a specific patient.

134
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:36,825
Besides,

135
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,480
when you were busy,

136
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,950
you turned down many patients.

137
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,250
What?

138
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Why is it so hard for you this time?

139
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,200
Are you

140
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,425
afraid to operate on that patient,

141
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,720
or do you want to operate

142
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,000
and are afraid you won't do it well?

143
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,625
Think about it.

144
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,450
Dr. Gu.

145
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,160
Dr. Gu.

146
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,775
I know you're still in there.

147
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,559
It's okay. I'm not rushing you.

148
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,650
Take your time.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,650
I just want to tell you,

150
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,040
we still

151
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,350
have to see each other later,

152
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,750
so, see you.

153
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,354
Be good, Qiuqiu.

154
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:48,200
It's okay, Qiuqiu.

155
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,160
I don't want Dr. Yan.

156
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,279
I want Dr. Gu!

157
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,279
I want Dr. Gu!

158
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,025
Dr. Gu is the best!

159
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,816
Dr. Yan is also very good.

160
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes, Qiuqiu.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
Dr. Yan is very good.

162
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,300
- Be good, OK?
- No!

163
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,799
If it's not Dr. Gu,
I won't do the surgery.

164
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,119
- It's okay. It's okay.
- You bad boy!

165
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,239
- Mrs. Mrs.
- Mrs.

166
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,640
Don't be angry.

167
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,559
It's okay. It's okay.

168
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,475
Come on, Qiuqiu, Ultraman.

169
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:09,700
Be like him.

170
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,239
Qiuqiu.

171
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,320
Don't cry. Don't cry.

172
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,079
- Be good, Qiuqiu.
- Here, Ultraman.

173
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,125
OK? Take it.

174
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,125
No, I don't want it!

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,700
Hello?

176
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:19,239
Don't cry.

177
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,675
Hello, Dr. Yan, it's me.

178
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,375
I have

179
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,450
a favor to ask you.

180
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,025
Can I go to the Operating Room

181
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,550
for Qiuqiu's surgery this afternoon?

182
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,700
I know it's…

183
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,950
I know it's very complicated,

184
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,650
so I'm calling you

185
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,050
to ask you a favor.

186
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:50,325
(In-patient)

187
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,625
Is Dr. Gu here?

188
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't worry, Qiuqiu.

189
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,200
Dr. Yan can do your surgery well.

190
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,119
I'll stay with you

191
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,225
until the surgery is over, okay?

192
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:18,400
This book has 899 pages.

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,475
I have to memorize them all.

194
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,850
It's too hard for me.

195
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,325
Gu Wei.

196
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,725
You are just in time.

197
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,719
Help me.

198
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,750
There's so much
to memorize in this book.

199
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,550
Can you help me highlight it?

200
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:32,050
What do you think?

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,175
Do you think patients will get sick
according to the highlights?

202
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,900
Patients put their lives in your hands

203
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,400
because they trust you.

204
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,200
We doctors

205
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,825
can't take any chances.

206
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,275
We must be prepared for anything.

207
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,375
Memorize them all.

208
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,039
I'll check you next Monday.

209
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,800
Okay.

210
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,900
If there is any uncertainty,

211
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,350
we can never

212
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,050
jeopardize the patient's life.

213
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,650
Dr. Gu.

214
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,150
Here you are.

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,475
I have something to tell you.

216
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,850
Take a seat.

217
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,475
Thank you.

218
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,075
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

219
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,275
Dr. Gu.

220
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,125
Sorry, I…

221
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,250
I broke it. I am so sorry.

222
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,825
This is a birthday present for Qiuqiu.

223
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,725
Let me.

224
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,200
Let me fix it for you.

225
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,600
Hold on.

226
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,320
What's broken is broken.

227
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,400
It can't be repaired.

228
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,159
No way.

229
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,679
I can fix it.

230
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,275
Hold on.

231
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,575
Look, well bandaged.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,725
Here you are.

233
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,950
Because of my teacher.

234
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,791
I couldn't save him.

235
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,700
So now

236
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,941
my shaking hands

237
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,600
are caused by my mental disorder.

238
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,725
So

239
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,700
I shouldn't have surgery on anyone

240
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,150
in this situation.

241
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,125
Understand?

242
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,479
So it's not that

243
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,775
you didn't like my gift.

244
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,425
Shall I get it back for you?

245
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,700
That anti-hair loss product

246
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,050
works really well.

247
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,125
I mean it.

248
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:46,575
(Bar Party Group)

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,050
Find her for me.

250
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,900
Thank you.

251
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,950
(Bar Party Group)
Find her for me.

252
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,950
(Bar Party Group)
Thank you.

253
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:02,275
(Bar Party Group)

254
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:17,800
(Bar Party Group)
Here she is.

255
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,325
One more Depth Charge.

256
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,150
Easy.

257
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,200
I will pay.

258
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,450
It's so boring to drink alone.

259
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,675
Let me join you.

260
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,225
How did you know I was here?

261
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,725
This may be God's arrangement.

262
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,675
Whatever she ordered, double it.

263
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,250
Do you really want to drink with me?

264
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,679
Yes.

265
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,175
Do you dare?

266
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,725
So exciting.

267
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:20,700
I like it.

268
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,100
So it's not that

269
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,025
you didn't like my gift.

270
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,359
Shall I get it back for you?

271
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,880
That anti-hair loss product
works really well.

272
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,960
I didn't lie to you.

273
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,725
My hairline has grown out

274
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:37,556
since I used this.

275
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,520
I got it.

276
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,775
What's wrong?

277
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,300
Mr. Lin, let me ask you.

278
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,975
If a person confides his sadness

279
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:55,280
to you,

280
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,479
should you comfort him

281
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,250
right away?

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,679
What?

283
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,125
Go to sleep. It's late.

284
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,740
Okay.

285
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,039
Where is she?

286
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,275
She's gone.

287
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,150
Sir, please settle the bill.

288
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:17,775
(Fool)

289
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:23,100
You are such a good drinker.

290
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:40,291
(Fool)

291
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,675
I will take you down sooner or later.

292
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:12,775
Wine can really boost courage.

293
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:23,839
- Hello, Mr. Lin.
- Hello, Mr. Lin.

294
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:24,950
Hello.

295
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,500
Feel free.

296
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,450
We're not in the office now.

297
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,425
You can hold your hands.

298
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,725
It's okay.

299
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,920
It's so kind of you

300
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,280
to visit him in person.

301
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,599
It's what we should do.

302
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,880
We heard that Mr. Lin is ill.

303
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,925
So we came to visit him.

304
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:44,165
That's it, Ms. Li.

305
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,599
It's Zhixiao's fault.

306
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,680
Mr. Lin is sick and hospitalized.

307
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,175
She didn't tell us

308
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:49,214
about such a big thing.

309
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,250
Lin Zhixiao did the right thing.

310
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:53,375
I just got a gastric ulcer.

311
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,780
You don't have to be nervous.

312
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,300
I feel

313
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,461
your kindness.

314
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,525
I am so happy.

315
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,000
Exactly.

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,239
If I am half as considerate as them,

317
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,100
would you be satisfied, Mr. Lin?

318
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,800
How long will

319
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,160
your exchange study last?

320
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,280
It's short. Only about three months.

321
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,125
That's great.

322
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,680
You can take this opportunity

323
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,375
to get to know the school.

324
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:18,900
If appropriate,

325
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,500
you may consider studying abroad
for postgraduate study.

326
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,150
Yes.

327
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,900
By the way, Mr. Lin,

328
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:24,875
we heard that

329
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,520
the Faculty of Music over there is
also very good.

330
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,650
We can get some information back
for Zhixiao.

331
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:31,520
Be careful then.

332
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,100
She may lose face abroad.

333
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,200
Mr. Lin.

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,880
Keep the bottom line
for further contact.

335
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,950
If I achieve something in the future,

336
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,225
I will take Ms. Li abroad

337
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,479
instead of you.

338
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,425
Don't blame me for being stingy then.

339
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,625
By then,

340
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,975
I will be grey-haired, teetering

341
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:52,414
and can't even walk.

342
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,775
I won't travel anymore.

343
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,975
Zhixiao.

344
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,319
Prepare fruit for them.

345
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,175
- Yes, wash the apples.
- Okay.

346
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,000
- Take a seat. Feel free.
- Take a seat.

347
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,880
You take a seat. I will go with Zhixiao.

348
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,075
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

349
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:09,760
Let's go.

350
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Zhixiao.

351
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:16,450
I heard from Sansan

352
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,500
that Mr. Lin…

353
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:22,800
Yes.

354
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,875
Gastric cancer.

355
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,839
But no one told him.

356
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,750
It was kept secret.

357
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,025
Just keep it in mind.

358
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,075
Why are you still arguing with him
like before?

359
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,900
It may irritate him.

360
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,100
Listen.

361
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,119
The best way to treat a patient

362
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,800
at this time

363
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,640
is to treat him as a healthy person.

364
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,225
It's the best for him.

365
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,675
Zhixiao.

366
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,925
I feel you are more mature.

367
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,054
You thoroughly remoulded yourself

368
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,525
just in a few days.

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,200
It's okay.

370
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,475
Not a big deal.

371
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,500
Why so sad?

372
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:01,225
Let me tell you something happy.

373
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:01,921
Okay.

374
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,079
Good news.

375
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,625
What good news?

376
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,400
Are you and Jin Shi
planning to register your marriage?

377
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,119
I'll transfer you 10 yuan.

378
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,400
What are you talking about?

379
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
I've been keeping an eye

380
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,700
on your orchestra

381
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,359
for the past few days
you were not there.

382
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,239
The principal cellist

383
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,325
has a temporary emergency

384
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,850
and can't participate
in the summer show.

385
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,900
What good news is this?

386
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,980
What does it have to do with me?

387
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,719
Come on.

388
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,850
Why are you so heartless?

389
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,450
Think about it. If she's absent,

390
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,920
the orchestra will need a replacement.

391
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,550
Who else can play the cello?

392
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
Only you!

393
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,750
It makes sense!

394
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,675
I have to give it a go this time

395
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,225
and show them that I, Lin Zhixiao,

396
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:43,421
am a talented cellist.

397
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,525
Let's go wash the apples.

398
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Okay. Mr. Jin, what do you think

399
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,000
of the rhythm?

400
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,050
I think

401
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,359
the speed of 23-27

402
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,239
can be slower.

403
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,575
23 to 27?

404
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:55,680
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

405
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,325
Everyone.

406
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:57,275
That's all for today's rehearsal.

407
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,101
Thank you.

408
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,750
Mr. Jin.

409
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,725
Zhixiao.

410
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:03,880
I would like to ask you

411
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,150
when I could be transferred back

412
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,575
to the cello team?

413
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,000
You know the original piece

414
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,560
required each cellist

415
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,239
to perform a solo.

416
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:13,079
- So…
- I got it, sir.

417
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,225
I will definitely take the time
to practice.

418
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:15,200
Please don't worry.

419
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,520
I mean

420
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,920
we have decided to change the piece
this time.

421
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,760
There is no more vacancy
in the cello team.

422
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,425
There will be many opportunities
in the future.

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,800
That's it.

424
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,375
Dr. Gu.

425
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,450
Are you off duty?

426
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,300
Yes.

427
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,200
Why do you come here?

428
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:15,850
I've been in a seminar
for the whole morning

429
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,475
and heard too many suggestions.

430
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,925
So I come here
to get some air to sober up.

431
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,100
You seem

432
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,800
not as noisy as usual.

433
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,625
Noisy?

434
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,375
I'm quiet all the time.

435
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,850
What's wrong?

436
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,625
What happened to you?

437
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,625
Never mind.

438
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,825
Just the teacher of the orchestra
weeded me out

439
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,370
because of my incapability.

440
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,439
I'm left out.

441
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:52,400
I only have to play the triangle.

442
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,575
There're several cellists
in the orchestra,

443
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,725
but only one plays the triangle.

444
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,900
So, you're unique.

445
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,600
You're so good at comforting.

446
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,150
I'm fine.

447
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,775
You don't have to comfort me.

448
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,625
I didn't take playing the cello
as my future profession

449
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,450
and practice hard for it

450
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,079
when I was little.

451
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,450
It was in high school

452
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,000
when I started to work hard.

453
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But I'm not talented,

454
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
so I was neglected in school.

455
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,150
I'm used to it.

456
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,800
Don't worry.

457
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,500
I won't get depressed for long

458
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,581
or give up.

459
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,425
For me,

460
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:33,100
a tin of cola

461
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,220
will cure everything.

462
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,025
Good.

463
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:40,450
I'm suddenly cheered up.

464
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,200
How about you, Dr. Gu?

465
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,750
You mentioned your teacher yesterday.

466
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,300
If you trust me,

467
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,619
you can talk about it with me.

468
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,439
Of course, if you don't,

469
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,600
I won't push you.

470
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,700
This is not a secret.

471
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,175
About a month ago,

472
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,025
my teacher, Liang Zhou

473
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,825
was hospitalized
because of pancreatic cancer.

474
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:17,900
I was responsible for his treatment.

475
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,850
Teacher,

476
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,425
I suggest a laparoscopic
distal pancreatectomy

477
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:23,920
and splenectomy.

478
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,560
It will cause a small wound
and recover quickly.

479
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,975
I think it's suitable for you.

480
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,920
Gu Wei, how's Liang Zhou?

481
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,359
Don't worry, Mrs.

482
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,650
The surgery went well.

483
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,300
A few days later,

484
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,400
his situation turned worse rapidly.

485
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:41,800
Dr. Gu.

486
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,400
It's has been over 30 minutes.

487
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,350
Dr. Gu.

488
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:45,479
Get away.

489
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,050
Rest assured, teacher,

490
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:52,075
I won't let you down.

491
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:52,925
OK.

492
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,599
Come back.

493
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,650
Come back.

494
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:01,194
(…my only wish is to save people.)

495
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:03,850
(Keep moving on and stay true
to my mission. Liang Zhou)

496
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,200
Come back.

497
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,079
So,

498
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,775
what's wrong

499
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:02,375
with Mr. Liang's treatment?

500
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,150
The acute hemorrhage after surgery.

501
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,225
Many people must have comforted you

502
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:18,740
that it was not your fault.

503
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,225
Why do you still have a mental barrier?

504
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,600
Is it because of

505
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,840
"not sure"?

506
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,850
Because it's not sure,

507
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,959
you don't know

508
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,479
whether your treatment is wrong.

509
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,775
That's why you have a mental barrier.

510
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm right.

511
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,700
That's it.

512
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,625
I saw you rescuing a patient

513
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,319
in the ward that day.

514
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,800
I know you must be the genius type

515
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,975
who wants to control everything.

516
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,479
People like you

517
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,800
believe that you can change the world

518
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,350
with your strength.

519
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,000
So, when something goes wrong,

520
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,700
you feel more obliged

521
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,439
and helpless

522
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,850
than others.

523
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,680
In fact,
when you stride over the barrier

524
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,825
and look back,

525
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,560
you'll find it's not a big deal.

526
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,200
Well,

527
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,425
have you ever been helpless?

528
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,400
See, I said

529
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,479
you've met too few setbacks.

530
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,640
People like us

531
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,800
have already

532
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,700
grown thick-skinned.

533
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,825
Now, for me,

534
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:37,025
each setback is the impetus to move on.

535
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,450
That's right.

536
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,350
These are the words

537
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,325
for kids at your age.

538
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,800
What do you mean?

539
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,479
How can you start personal abuse?

540
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,760
Who is the kid?

541
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,375
I'm a mature lady.

542
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,800
You're the student
of Huaqing University, right?

543
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,625
Yes.

544
00:28:58,575 --> 00:28:59,825
I was, too.

545
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,150
Bachelor of medicine in the year 2006.

546
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,400
Then you're my senior.

547
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,075
Nice to meet you.

548
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,500
The year 2006.

549
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,680
You're so much older than me.

550
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,725
It's hard to tell.

551
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:14,126
You look so young.

552
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:15,599
Really?

553
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,560
At least you have so many hairs.

554
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
If you used my shampoo,

555
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,400
your hair can be better.

556
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:23,850
Mm.

557
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,560
Can't you take a joke?

558
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,525
How come you get mad?

559
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,959
Don't be mad.

560
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,075
I was joking.

561
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,319
You know what, Dr. Gu?

562
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,925
I envy you so much.

563
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,250
Truly.

564
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,325
I think you

565
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,599
have the gift of a good surgeon.

566
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,525
The gift is desirable

567
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:47,200
for many people.

568
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,875
If I'm as talented as you,

569
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:53,479
I must stand on the world-class stage

570
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,239
despite of any difficulty.

571
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,975
Anyway,

572
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:59,225
just confront the difficulty
when I meet it.

573
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,800
Things will go well
when we come to them.

574
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:05,325
Or I'll just make them well.

575
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,300
Mr. Lin.

576
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,075
Hello, Mr. Lin.

577
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,575
Where are you?

578
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,921
I took a trip back to school.

579
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,000
What are you shouting for?

580
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,119
Could you please respect me?

581
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,100
I've been back now.

582
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,900
Wait for a while.

583
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,359
Hurry up.

584
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,900
Get it, get it, bye-bye.

585
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,719
Mr. Lin, you know him.

586
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,725
I'm gonna leave.

587
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,300
Come on.

588
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,975
Dr. Gu,

589
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,350
you're really a very good doctor

590
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,645
in my eyes.

591
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:51,475
Don't give up

592
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,100
even if you don't do the surgery
for Mr. Lin.

593
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,825
See you.

594
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,350
Lin Zhixiao.

595
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,950
What are you up to?

596
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,959
Sticking to it.

597
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,450
Enjoy your food, Mr. Lin.

598
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,400
Why do you get out again?

599
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,800
Mr. Jin.

600
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,600
I know I didn't perform well

601
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,525
and you were dissatisfied with me.

602
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,119
Sorry that

603
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,950
I disappointed you.

604
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,125
I've been playing the cello
since I was little.

605
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,880
But I'm never

606
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,875
a talented cellist.

607
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:02,800
Sometimes,

608
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,000
I have to take more time to master

609
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:08,000
what other people can understand easily.

610
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,600
Sometimes, I make mistakes

611
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,975
and I feel disappointed in myself.

612
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,575
However,

613
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,875
I have the unique strength,

614
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,475
which is,

615
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,479
never giving up

616
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,125
the dream of being a cellist.

617
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,839
I'll work tens and hundreds
of time harder

618
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,250
than others.

619
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:29,800
Though I have to take care
of my dad now,

620
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,725
I'll spend even a minute of spare time

621
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,760
to practice,

622
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,500
understand and study the pieces.

623
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,040
Mr. Jin,

624
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,425
please trust my resolution.

625
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,450
If you allow me to play the cello again,

626
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,680
I'll try my best

627
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,959
and won't let you down.

628
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,125
Mr. Jin,

629
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,650
please give me another chance.

630
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,706
(Dr. Gu, come on!)

631
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,575
See, I said

632
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:12,534
you've met too few setbacks.

633
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,040
In fact,
when you stride over the barrier

634
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,300
and look back,

635
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,150
you'll find it's not a big deal.

636
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,950
Each setback is the impetus to move on.

637
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,650
Come on, Dr. Gu.

638
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:33,450
Dr. Gu,

639
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,725
you're really a very good doctor

640
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:37,025
in my eyes.

641
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,119
Don't give up

642
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,475
even if you don't do the surgery
for Mr. Lin.

643
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,560
Wei, could you come out for a while?

644
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,625
Here's an emergency.

645
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,475
My son is suffering so much.

646
00:33:58,475 --> 00:33:59,575
You don't even care about it.

647
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:00,400
You call yourself doctors?

648
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,520
But it's normal to bleed
after the surgery.

649
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,839
Dr. Gu has dealt with it.

650
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,680
- It's not...
- Get away.

651
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,625
I'm talking to him.

652
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,040
None of your business.

653
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,150
Please calm down.

654
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:09,959
I see, you're Gu Wei.

655
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,475
You just caused an accident

656
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,040
and killed your teacher.

657
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,360
Mind your words.

658
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
How unfortunate

659
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,280
my son is to be here

660
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,200
- when you're on duty.
- Honey.

661
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,520
Honey, our son is fainted out of pain.

662
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,360
Find a way out for my son.

663
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,120
- Stop shouting. Stop shouting.
- Listen,

664
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,239
- I'm gonna complain.
- Sir.

665
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,280
- I'm gonna complain.
- Could you please calm down?

666
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,399
Stop it.

667
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,550
Watch out.

668
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,391
I won't let you go.

669
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,800
Lin Zhixiao.

670
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,150
Dr. Gu, are you alright?

671
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,225
Lin Zhixiao.

672
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,450
Gosh!

673
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,025
Blood.

674
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,825
Dr. Gu, please be gentle.

675
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,800
I haven't started.

676
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,575
Don't move.

677
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,159
Gently, gently, gently.

678
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,525
You know it's painful now?

679
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,320
I don't know
whether I should appreciate you

680
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,575
or scold you.

681
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,525
It was so dangerous.

682
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,275
But you rushed in recklessly.

683
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:17,775
It's lucky that the cut is not deep.

684
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,320
I saved you anyway,

685
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,975
OK?

686
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,675
Who is responsible for the wound?

687
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,200
I wish someone

688
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,150
can do the surgery for my dad

689
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,175
for the sake of my injury.

690
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,525
Done.

691
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,959
Does it hurt?

692
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,225
It's OK.

693
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,075
When I was little,

694
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:42,806
my dad treated me as a boy.

695
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,700
The other girls,

696
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,019
if they fell, for example,

697
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,000
their parents would hold them up

698
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,550
and coax.

699
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,100
My dad was like,

700
00:35:51,675 --> 00:35:53,375
Lin Zhixiao,

701
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,496
get up where you fall.

702
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,025
Just like he did in the office.

703
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,400
Does it hurt

704
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,600
when stitching?

705
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,850
Are you so afraid of pain?

706
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:44,760
How's it?

707
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,225
It's cute.

708
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:52,945
This pig is so cute.

709
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,750
It's a chicken actually.

710
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,120
The nurses of children's ward

711
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,025
taught me when I rotated there.

712
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,479
I felt it looked like a chicken
just now,

713
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,679
but I was embarrassed to say it.

714
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,300
It's a lovely chicken.

715
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,600
You get stitched then.

716
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,050
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

717
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,175
I'll start now.

718
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:22,900
Ready.

719
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,075
Hold on, Dr. Gu.

720
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,250
Don't you have to anesthetize me

721
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,199
before stitching?

722
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,479
Lin Zhixiao,

723
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,175
you make the choice.

724
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,150
If you get anesthesia,
it would be four stitches.

725
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:36,760
And two stitches without anesthesia.

726
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,575
Make the choice.

727
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,075
Two stitches.

728
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:41,675
Come here.

729
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,325
I'll be as gentle as I can.

730
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:47,175
It will be a little hurt. Hang in there.

731
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:47,950
OK.

732
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,175
It's almost done.

733
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:00,350
OK.

734
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,000
Hang in there.

735
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:20,919
Dr. Gu.

736
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:22,450
Your eyes are so beautiful.

737
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,875
It's not painful, right?

738
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:26,560
Don't misunderstand. I didn't mean it.

739
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,200
It's just out of aesthetics.

740
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,850
Anything I should mind?

741
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,451
Keep wound out of water
in three days.

742
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,250
Change the medicine every other day.

743
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,050
Come to me to take out the stitches
five days later.

744
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,300
Don't eat spicy food.

745
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,100
It doesn't hurt, does it?

746
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,520
It's done.

747
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,550
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

748
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,300
Mm.

749
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:53,959
I'm gonna leave.

750
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,199
Bye-bye.

751
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,550
Mind your wound.

752
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,250
OK.

753
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,250
Bye-bye.

754
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,150
The chicken balloon.

755
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,520
I see, you're Gu Wei.

756
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,479
I heard that

757
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:25,080
you just caused an accident

758
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,879
and killed your teacher.

759
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,239
You're an irresponsible doctor.

760
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,775
Mind your words.

761
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:37,275
Dr. Gu.

762
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,200
Are you off duty?

763
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:41,900
Yes.

764
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,275
Let me take you somewhere.

765
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,675
Well, I'm not going…

766
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,600
- Come on.
- I…

767
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,000
I've saved you.

768
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,110
Do me an honor.

769
00:39:59,075 --> 00:39:59,879
Say it again.

770
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:00,975
What did you ask me to do?

771
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,450
Climbing through the window.

772
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,210
Climbing through the window?

773
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:04,675
Take it ease.

774
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,506
This is the tradition
of our Department of Music.

775
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:07,625
Almost every student has climbed in

776
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,225
through the window to rehearse.

777
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,199
No way, Dr. Gu.

778
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,840
Haven't you ever done something wrong

779
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,975
when you were a student?

780
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:15,875
I think it's because
there're too little homework

781
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,280
for you students of Department of Music.

782
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,775
Old fogey. Wait here.

783
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,925
Look at me.

784
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,575
Come in.

785
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,239
Dr. Gu.

786
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,439
You're really interesting.

787
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:33,025
You can get in with one step.

788
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:34,746
Why are you being so stable outside?

789
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,775
Forget it.

790
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,479
I don't understand

791
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,550
the good students like you.

792
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,675
Wait for me in the front door.

793
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:43,554
I'll open the door for you.

794
00:40:50,054 --> 00:40:52,975
(Huaqing University)

795
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,600
Lin Zhixiao.

796
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,525
The door is unlocked.

797
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,325
I don't know it's unlocked today.

798
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,320
Don't you lose your mind by the hurt?

799
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,525
No.

800
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:08,639
Get in?

801
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,600
How's it?

802
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,879
No one's here.

803
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,275
Is it super atmospheric?

804
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,800
When I was in high school,

805
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,300
I was with poor grades.

806
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,825
I had no idea what I could do

807
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,800
and whether I could
enter the university.

808
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,840
I almost gave up

809
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,975
until a senior

810
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,850
encouraged me

811
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,550
and pointed the direction for me.

812
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,600
I remember that day,

813
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,050
he took me

814
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,500
to climb in through the window.

815
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,625
He stood up here

816
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,525
and had an agreement with me.

817
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:04,750
Zhixiao,

818
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,800
when you entered Huaqing University,

819
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,575
we'll cooperate here.

820
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,479
So, you really entered it.

821
00:42:13,925 --> 00:42:14,850
Yes.

822
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,600
From then on, I'll come here

823
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,625
when I come across

824
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:20,225
any difficulty.

825
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,125
And I will be relieved.

826
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,500
So, Dr. Gu,

827
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,300
I want to share it with you.

828
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:28,750
OK.

829
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,825
Are you going to play for me?

830
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,080
Hold on.

831
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,725
Thank you, Dr. Gu,

832
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:47,736
for curing Mr. Lin on time.

833
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,360
I specially chose

834
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,200
this song for you.

835
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,300
Listen to it carefully.

836
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,875
Ready.

837
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,239
How's it? Is it good?

838
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,150
Good.

839
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,239
Dr. Gu.

840
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,175
Do you know

841
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:53,550
what my impression on you is?

842
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,375
At first,

843
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,550
I greatly misunderstood you.

844
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,950
Now I don't understand

845
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,175
you very comprehensively,

846
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,985
but I'm sure for one thing,

847
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,400
that's,

848
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,525
you're a very good doctor.

849
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,900
Zhixiao.

850
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,450
Yes?

851
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,625
=The Oath of Love=
What's Mr. Lin's impression on me?

852
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,450
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)

853
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,825
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
The first impression?

854
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:27,850
Yes.

855
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,925
A fair-faced man.

856
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:34,325
Get promoted by relationships.

857
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,100
What?

858
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,218
Yes.

859
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,425
Have you explained it to Mr. Lin?

860
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:43,025
I didn't get the chance to explain.

861
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,800
Why does Mr. Lin

862
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,400
get this impression on me?

863
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,925
I don't know.

864
00:44:48,925 --> 00:44:51,925
Perhaps, probably, maybe,

865
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,125
it's a misunderstanding.

866
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,550
Mistake.

867
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:57,825
You said that, right?

868
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,500
No, you're handsome.
