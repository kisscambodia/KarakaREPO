00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:43,774
Surprise!

4
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,790
Happy birthday!

5
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,990
It's falling!

6
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,950
Let me see!

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,550

[Episode 9]

9
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,550
I'm coming

10
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,070
Who will come during mid night?

11
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,830
What are you doing?

12
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,070
Let me open it

13
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,110
Why do you bring the knife?

14
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,430
A girl shouldn't open
the door during mid night

15
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,150
Who is that?

16
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,350
I'm looking for Mo Mo

17
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,590
Fu Pei

18
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,990
Are you okay?

19
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,830
Shall we talk?

20
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,670
I have something to tell you

21
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,390
Okay

22
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,070
Let's go

23
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,350
Mo Mo

24
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,950
Fu Pei, let me go

25
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,110
Mo Mo, give me one more chance

26
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,670
Get off me

27
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,150
What are you doing?

28
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,470
Take your time

29
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,390
Carry on
I'll leave first

30
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,190
Thank you

31
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,630
Why did Fu Pei look for you?

32
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,230
You're straight to the point, huh?

33
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,030
So?

34
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,710
Why did he look for you?

35
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,230
Gu Wei Yi

36
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,550
You've never been a busybody before

37
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,670
Your mother asked me to look after you

38
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,030
Did she pay you?

39
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,030
Yes

40
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,430
The rental

41
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,470
What were you guys doing out there?

42
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,590
Don't you want to talk to me?

43
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,670
I want to be with you

44
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,110
What?

45
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,070
Let's get together

46
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,190
Forget it, we're not suitable

47
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,750
Why?

48
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,870
Are you falling into Gu...

49
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
Someone else?

50
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,150
No

51
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,310
I just stopped loving you

52
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:55,830
In your heart,

53
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,710
I'm nothing

54
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,710
and you can give up anytime, right?

55
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,070
Why did you stick on me and pretend

56
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,150
that you won't leave me forever?

57
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,110
Did I beg you?

58
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,150
No, I did not

59
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,830
I didn't mean

60
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,790
to stop loving you suddenly

61
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,310
When you told Xu Jie Er

62
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,350
that we're not a couple,

63
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,750
I told myself,

64
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,550
you're protecting me

65
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,270
When you let go of my hand
on the bridge in the school,

66
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,830
I told myself,

67
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,150
you're afraid

68
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,470
Anyone can feel afraid

69
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,350
Every time you promised me

70
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,150
but didn't turn up,

71
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,710
I told myself,

72
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,470
you're too crazy in games

73
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,590
and forgot it

74
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,990
When you smiled

75
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,390
and asked me to get
a girlfriend for you,

76
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,110
I just couldn't convince myself

77
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,270
When I saw you running

78
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,070
out from Gu Wei Yi's house,

79
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,790
I was upset with myself

80
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,750
That day, when I saw
you and Wang Shan...

81
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,870
I suddenly found that

82
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,750
I was not sad anymore

83
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,630
No, I should say

84
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,870
that I no longer feel sad because of you

85
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,950
I felt sad because I found

86
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,110
I stopped loving you finally

87
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,350
I didn't mean to stop it suddenly

88
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,350
It's because you always ran out

89
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,310
and left me alone at the place

90
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,550
Then?

91
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,150
I'll buy some medicine for you

92
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,150
-Fu Pei, let me go
-Mo Mo

93
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,950
-Fu Pei!
-Mo Mo

94
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,510
Get off me

95
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,670
Mo Mo, give me one more chance

96
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,910
Get off me

97
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,869
Give me one more chance

98
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,750
Last chance

99
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,269
I'll never do that again

100
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,870
Calm down

101
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,750
Get off me

102
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,390
Let me go

103
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,830
I really no longer like you

104
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,430
He confessed to me

105
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,430
Then?

106
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,070
We had a fight

107
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,590
I'm tired, I'm going to bed

108
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,630
He hit you?

109
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,150
No, I hit him

110
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,390
I hit him

111
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,670
Really?

112
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,190
Really

113
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,990
Really?

114
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,150
Really

115
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,750
Why did you hit him?

116
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,430
As I rejected him

117
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,190
but he's still mumbling

118
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,910
You rejected him?

119
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,390
I'm going to bed

120
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,790
As I rejected him

121
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,150
Fu Pei

122
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,990
Why not pick up the call?

123
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,470
I have been calling you
the whole night

124
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,510
Have you registered for CET 4...

125
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,510
What's wrong with you??

126
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,470
Come with me

127
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,310
It seemed I always apply
medicine for you recently

128
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,350
I confessed to Mo Mo

129
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,070
and she rejected me

130
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,150
I guessed it

131
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,170
She hit you?

132
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,090
No

133
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,710
My father hit me

134
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,750
Your father?

135
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,430
It's alright

136
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,550
He used to hit me when I was small

137
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,710
This is just a small hurt

138
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,390
Maybe I've been annoying since I was small

139
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,550
Now Mo Mo doesn't like me too

140
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,390
What if I say I like you?

141
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,550
Give me a chance to stay by your side

142
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,830
I know you still like Mo Mo

143
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,790
I can wait

144
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,070
Don't

145
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,790
That's my decision

146
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,630
Wang Shan

147
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,550
Even though I'm tall and strong,

148
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,630
but I'm actually timid

149
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,310
When I face something awkward,

150
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,390
I will run away immediately

151
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,950
I don't know how to say no to girls

152
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,910
So, everyone thought I was fickle

153
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,990
Now I don't even know what to do

154
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,950
with my relationship with Mo Mo

155
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:52,990
I don't deserve you

156
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,750
It's my call

157
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,510
Fu Pei

158
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,270
I didn't feel you're timid

159
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,390
as you saved me at the stall that day

160
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,710
I didn't feel you're fickle

161
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,910
as I knew that

162
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,790
you only love Mo Mo all the time

163
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,750
Mo Mo

164
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,270
doesn't like you anymore

165
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,710
I think...

166
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,550
The most important thing is...

167
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,510
Although I'm not as tall as you,

168
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,710
I'm not tiny

169
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,270
We're matched perfectly

170
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,590
Are you here to comfort me?

171
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,510
Well,

172
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,110
don't keep my words

173
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,070
in your heart

174
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,830
I will keep bugging you after this

175
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,230
No one can stop me

176
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,150
Come on

177
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,110
Li Na, brief the introduction

178
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,230
There is an insurance company

179
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,750
coming from their HQ in USA

180
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,030
They want to enter China's market

181
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,190
and their main request is creativeness

182
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,750
Let's share your views

183
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,974
[Done your thesis?]

184
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,430
The local marketing
should base on families

185
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,030
Most of the advertisements
are family-style

186
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,590
It's not creative

187
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,550
I saw several similar ads
on my way to the office

188
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,430
Agreed

189
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,270
Throw out the outdated
and bring up the creative

190
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,390
They come from the HQ in USA

191
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,990
They must emphasize on creativity

192
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,670
China's market is
approaching to family-style

193
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,470
Don't you have any new idea?

194
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:49,910
Mo Mo

195
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,710
Mo Mo

196
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,310
What's your view?

197
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,590
You don't have to get up

198
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,230
So sorry

199
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,270
Can we just frighten the consumers?

200
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,430
For example,

201
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,950
any uncertain accident could happen

202
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,030
When you're enjoying
the fossil exhibition,

203
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,030
you might get hurt
by a bone of dinosaur
which falls suddenly

204
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,230
In term of parents love

205
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,230
When something happens on you,

206
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,470
your children might
be displaced out there

207
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,830
In term of insurance benefits,

208
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,070
consumers are earning no
matter there's an accident or not

209
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,710
You have a lot of ideas

210
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,550
Okay, Li Na

211
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,870
Try to get three proposals

212
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,550
by next Monday

213
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,350
Okay

214
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,150
Dismiss

215
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,830
Hello, Shan Shan

216
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,910
Why did you call me
back to the university?

217
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,630
The counselor got mad today

218
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,550
According to him,

219
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,390
we have the least submission of thesis

220
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,830
Quickly pass it up if you're free

221
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,270
It might affect our graduation

222
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,910
I have something to tell you

223
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,350
What is it so mysterious?

224
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,790
Let's talk when we meet

225
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,510
Okay, I'll try to apply for a leave later

226
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,870
Bye

227
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,470
Miss Li Na, your note book?

228
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,510
Thank you

229
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,150
Complete a proposal together with Jie Er

230
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,910
Miss Li Na

231
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,750
I'd like to leave in the
afternoon to submit my thesis

232
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,710
Okay

233
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,670
But, don't take leave too often

234
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,150
Jie Er and you are both interns

235
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,579
But she seldom applies leave

236
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,509
Okay, thank you

237
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,150
It's crowded

238
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,070
Oh yeah

239
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:42,990
What did you

240
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,590
want to tell me?

241
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,670
I'll tell you later

242
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,910
Alright

243
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,990
I think the format of my thesis

244
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,070
should be no problem

245
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,030
You should

246
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,230
worry about the content

247
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,870
Can't you stop teasing me?

248
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,430
You off today?

249
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,830
I'm here to print my thesis

250
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,310
What about you?

251
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,430
I thought you have your
experiment in the old campus

252
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,390
I have something here

253
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,230
Oh yeah

254
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,670
She is my senior, Xie Yu Yin

255
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,110
I know her, we have met before

256
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,070
Right?

257
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,950
Your girlfriend?

258
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,150
Girlfriend?

259
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,390
How did you know?

260
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,230
That's crap!

261
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,430
Your words are confusing

262
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,830
It will cause misunderstanding

263
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,070
Misunderstanding?

264
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,990
How should I explain it?

265
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,790
After you took me to the counselor,

266
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,390
I bluffed him as I wanted to help

267
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,430
Gu Wei Yi

268
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,070
to join Professor Jiang's experiment

269
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,830
So, you are not a couple?

270
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,990
No, we're not

271
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,710
Your turn

272
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,110
Print your thesis

273
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,070
Okay
Shan Shan

274
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,830
Thank you

275
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,430
How much?

276
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,750
Scan and pay there

277
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,750
50 cents per piece

278
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,790
Let me pay for you

279
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,470
Thank you

280
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,070
It's paid

281
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,070
Okay

282
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,390
Gu...

283
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,390
Did you see any error here?

284
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,950
Here

285
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,150
I have calculated it

286
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,430
Should be no problem

287
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,710
Alright

288
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,030
It's not working

289
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,790
Slowly, let me do it

290
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,110
We'll leave first

291
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,830
See you

292
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,830
Bye

293
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,190
Let's go

294
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,190
Okay

295
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,630
I thought

296
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,870
Zhou Lei is finalising the
experiment in the old campus

297
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,710
What's wrong?

298
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,310
It's okay

299
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,830
What makes you so dull?

300
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,310
Nothing

301
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,830
Alright, forget it

302
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,630
You said

303
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,590
you have something to tell me

304
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,910
Why did you hum and haw?

305
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,830
I have confessed to Fu Pei

306
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,430
What did he say?

307
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,790
He said he didn't know how to say no

308
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,230
and he rejected me

309
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,270
But I won't give up

310
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,630
Are you angry?

311
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,670
No

312
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,910
Your look creeps me out

313
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,310
Frankly,

314
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,430
he confessed to me the other day

315
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,150
It's okay

316
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,950
I knew

317
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,710
Really?

318
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,150
Alright

319
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,030
I'm innocent

320
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,030
Bull shit

321
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,030
I don't know why,

322
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,190
but I feel sympathy to you now

323
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,630
Fu Pei is such a scum

324
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,270
You'll know it someday

325
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,790
Same as you

326
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,310
It was just ended and
now you're setting it up

327
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,710
What do you mean?

328
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,230
-I won't tell you
-What do you mean?

329
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,270
Make it clear

330
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,750
What's wrong with you?

331
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,230
I'm doing my thesis

332
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,110
My god!

333
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,030
Gosh!

334
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,990
How long you didn't wash your hair?

335
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,350
Since we cane back from the beach

336
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,310
Mo Mo

337
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,310
Can you buy me lunch?

338
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,910
Cut it out!

339
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,670
I haven't received my salary yet

340
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,470
Even the rental was paid by my mom

341
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,110
Gu Wei Yi asked for the rental?

342
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,830
What a stingy guy!

343
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,190
I must lecture him

344
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,790
What about

345
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,710
you bring me for dinner at your house?

346
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,350
I'll give him a lesson

347
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,430
Why do you always
want to go to my house?

348
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,870
I want to run out from here

349
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,750
No way

350
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,910
You are not welcomed

351
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,630
I must go there one day

352
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,230
Hello

353
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,830
Are you going home?

354
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,830
I'm going home

355
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,510
So early

356
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,870
My mother is coming

357
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,590
Who?

358
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,630
My mother

359
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,590
She wanted to treat you to dinner

360
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,230
I'm not hungry

361
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,030
I'll tell her then

362
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,270
Dont!

363
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,190
Why did she want to treat me?

364
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,590
I have no idea

365
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:45,990
I'll ask her

366
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,270
Dont!

367
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,790
I'll go with you

368
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,550
I'll wait for you downstairs

369
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,750
Okay

370
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,230
What's wrong?

371
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,870
Gu Wei Yi's mother is coming

372
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,310
She wanted to treat me to dinner

373
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,830
Go ahead

374
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,950
Why do you

375
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,510
look so sad like meeting
your mother in law?

376
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,150
Perhaps, I have a phobia
to meet the elderly

377
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:22,782
[Who created the printer?]

378
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,990
Why are you searching this?

379
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,310
Let's go

380
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,710
Are you sure?

381
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,870
Why not?

382
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,790
When will your mother get here?

383
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,750
Very soon

384
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,630
Is she fierce?

385
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,390
Like your mother

386
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,430
Do we need to wait for her outside?

387
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,990
How about a red carpet?

388
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,710
Forget it, I just need to calm down

389
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,910
Here is she

390
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,270
Hi, aunt

391
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,830
I'm Si Tu Mo

392
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,750
You are Wen Jun's daughter?

393
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,830
So pretty

394
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,750
Just like your mom

395
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,750
Thank you

396
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,110
Mom

397
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,990
Why are you standing here?

398
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,550
Let's sit down

399
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,550
Hurry up

400
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,350
This way please

401
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,830
Have you ordered the food?

402
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,190
Not yet

403
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,350
Waiter

404
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,270
Give me a braised meat platter

405
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,230
Do you eat seafood?

406
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,990
Yes

407
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,830
Okay

408
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,230
Mantis prawn

409
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,030
Your favourite

410
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,870
I thought you're allergic

411
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,550
She got it wrong

412
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,030
What's wrong?

413
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,150
I'm allergic to mantis prawn

414
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,310
No

415
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,110
Yes

416
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,270
When you're small,
I brought you to grandma's...

417
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,550
You're busy when I was small

418
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,950
I might've got it wrong

419
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,590
What a bad memory!

420
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,630
Do you eat fish?

421
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,950
Yes

422
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,710
Okay

423
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,670
Let's get a fish

424
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,990
Thank you for the meal

425
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,310
How was the food?

426
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,190
So good

427
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,310
That's good

428
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,870
Thank you and please come again

429
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,190
So sorry

430
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,950
to ask you out for dinner suddenly

431
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,230
In fact, I feel scared

432
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,670
to stay with him alone

433
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,670
Xiao Yi

434
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,150
We had our dinner quite early

435
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,070
Let's have some tea in the house

436
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,590
I have booked a cab for you

437
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,790
Can't you just cancel it?

438
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,070
You said you'll get insomnia after tea

439
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,470
Actually, it's alright

440
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,790
I think...

441
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,110
The cab is here

442
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,870
I've sent you the plate number

443
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,190
Call me when you're home

444
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,630
Let's go

445
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,390
See you, aunt

446
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,910
Be careful

447
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,870
Have something to tell?

448
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,670
I don't mean to pry into

449
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,270
your family affair

450
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,950
But the communication
between you and your mother...

451
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,190
When I was small, she was busy

452
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,990
and have no time for me

453
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,710
Can you teach me?

454
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,910
How did you make your mother

455
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,270
so docile?

456
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,750
I want to make my mother...

457
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,190
You know, my mother is talkative

458
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,550
and

459
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,070
excited in front of you

460
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,870
Don't you feel annoyed?

461
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,830
Am I right?
I saw the way you treated your mother

462
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,270
Hello, Jie Er

463
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,350
Do you have any idea

464
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,510
about the proposal?

465
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,350
Are you asking me

466
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,510
to figure it out on a Friday night?

467
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,910
But we need to submit it on Monday

468
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,790
You do it first

469
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,070
Let's discuss after this

470
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,190
But...

471
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,710
Alright, bye

472
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,910
Well...

473
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,990
Ready?

474
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,230
Add in cart?

475
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,990
Yes

476
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,030
Grab it at 12am

477
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,150
Alright

478
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,710
Many people are trying to get it

479
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,870
The Internet will be slow

480
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,070
Let's find a hotel outside

481
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,230
Find a hotel?

482
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,590
Do we need to do that?

483
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,190
It's only sales

484
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,350
That's crap!

485
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,310
Do you know how long it took me

486
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,830
to choose, compare the
prices and grab the coupons?

487
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,470
Don't make the crap if you don't know

488
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,990
how hard I worked for it!

489
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,750
Alright

490
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,350
Don't worry, I promise I'll get it

491
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,510
I'll go to a cyber cafe

492
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,230
Oh yeah

493
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,670
Double 11 Carnival

494
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,350
I forgot it

495
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,590
How can you forget it?

496
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,510
Don't wait?

497
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,870
Go shopping

498
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,270
We don't have to buy so much

499
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,550
It's trouble to move it after graduation

500
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,190
I just remembered that

501
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,590
Mo Mo's birthday is coming soon

502
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,950
I almost forget it

503
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,950
It's alright

504
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,270
I'll pick a gift for her

505
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,910
Me too

506
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,110
Today is Saturday

507
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,150
I'm surprised you
got up before noon

508
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,230
Don't mention it

509
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,630
Meng Lu called me in the morning

510
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,870
They wanted to come here

511
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,830
Don't worry

512
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,270
I have rejected them

513
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,070
Dig in

514
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,310
I bought yours too

515
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,070
I know that you hate crowds

516
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,070
Who comes so early?

517
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,510
I'll open it

518
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,350
Surprise!

519
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,830
Happy birthday!

520
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,110
Where is Mo Mo?

521
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,630
We decided to celebrate
outside, right?

522
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,630
Let's go

523
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,910
Why should we go out?

524
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,710
Ke said

525
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,830
they always have hot pots

526
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,150
and watch soccer games here

527
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,670
Your room-mates are here too

528
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,030
No way

529
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,870
Gu Wei Yi hates dirty

530
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,310
Let's go

531
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,670
Come in

532
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,070
You don't know
their destructive power

533
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,350
You'll regret it

534
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,790
Treat it as your birthday gift

535
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,430
Fatty, hurry up!

536
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,230
Don't urge me!

537
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,990
I'm in the toilet

538
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,870
Fu Pei

539
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,470
You don't want to go?

540
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,750
It's Si Tu Mo's birthday

541
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,790
I'll pass

542
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,590
Enjoy yourselves

543
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,070
Fatty

544
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,790
Stop urging me!

545
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,630
Hurry up!

546
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,670
Let's go

547
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:46,357
[Happy birthday, sorry...]

548
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,990
I don't care

549
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,470
It will leave marks on the wall

550
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,350
It's hard to remove

551
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,150
I have bought it, don't waste it

552
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:08,550
No way

553
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,710
Who's gonna clean it then?

554
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,870
It's nice for taking photos

555
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,710
It's nicer on the floor

556
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,030
You're studying advertising

557
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,030
Can you be more artistic?

558
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,590
Don't...

559
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,950
I'll go and help Niu Niu and Shan Shan

560
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,590
I don't care, I want
to stick balloons on the wall

561
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,750
Don't worry

562
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,070
I'll protect our wall no matter what

563
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,590
Let me help you

564
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,270
Hurry up!

565
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,670
I'll massage your scalp then

566
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,670
Happy birthday to you!

567
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,870
Happy birthday to you!

568
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,350
Happy birthday to Mo Mo!

569
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,670
Happy birthday to you!

570
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,470
You're one year older now

571
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,790
Make a wish!

572
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,070
It's time to make a wish!
I'll make a wish now

573
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,550
I wish peace to the world

574
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,190
and I get slim without any exercise

575
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,509
Dream on

576
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,510
I wish peace to the world

577
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,630
I always have money and slim body

578
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,070
Impossible!

579
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,790
Wait!

580
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,870
Let's take a photo

581

Hurry up!

582
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:22,670
Take a photo

583
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,830
Make my face smaller

584
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,710
Come on

585
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,590
1, 2, 3

586
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,070
Cheese! Happy birthday!

587
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,630
I'm one year younger!

588
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,630
Happy birthday!

589
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,070
Cut the cake!

590
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,190
Alright

591
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,070
Fatty

592
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,710
For you

593
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,670
Thank you, Mo Mo

594
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,460
What are you doing? This is mine

595
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,550
I want to be the first

596
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,350
Shan Shan
Thank you

597
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,670
Serve yourselves

598
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,870
Let's toast

599
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,510
Come on! Cheers

600
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,940
Happy birthday, Mo Mo!

601
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,630
Happy birthday

602
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,030
Happy birthday

603
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,070
Where is my birthday gift?

604
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,670
Birthday gift!

605
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,750
Chop, chop!

606
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,900
Give it to me now

607
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,900
Cold wave

608
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,750
Cut the crap!

609
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,590
I want gifts

610
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,150
It's shaking

611
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,310
Shaking!

612
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,390
The centre of the 3rd row

613
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,310
You help her again

614
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,110
Yeah, you did it again

615
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,670
Let her draw

616
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,310
on your face with a lipstick

617
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,590
I'll open my eyes

618
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,150
Closer

619
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,510
Closer

620
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,110
Who did it?

621
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,950
Him!

622
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,590
Gu Wei Yi did it

623
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,630
Which one?

624
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,750
3rd row...

625
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,390
No way!

626
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,710
Don't help her again

627
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,910
That's right

628
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:13,870
Falling

629
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,350
It's falling down

630
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,110
Let me see

631
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,670
Please find a person who
wears the same colour

632
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,310
and look at each other for 20 seconds

633
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,070
Nobody wears the same colour with me

634
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,590
Gu Wei Yi is wearing a yellow top

635
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,390
Yellowish brown

636
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,230
It's the same

637
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,910
It's yellow too

638
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,350
Look at each other!

639
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,110
Look at each other!

640
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,070
Look at each other!

641
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,670
Mo Mo, you bet, you pay!

642
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,510
Hurry up!

643
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,390
That's right

644
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,430
The timer is ready

645
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,830
Mo Mo

646
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,510
Are you feeling shy?

647
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,190
What for?

648
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,510
Gu Wei Yi, don't be shy

649
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,350
I'm never scared of it

650
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,630
Come on

651
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,470
Start

652
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,310
17

653
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,070
16

654
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,630
15

655
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,070
14

656
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,390
13

657
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,190
12

658
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,510
11

659
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:14,870
10

660
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,150
9

661
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,670
-Mo Mo!
-Mo Mo!

662
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,270
You're falling into his eyes

663
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,910
Alright, let's continue

664
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,470
Carry on

665
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,670
Your turn

666
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,590
Hurry up!

667
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,590
Hurry up!

668
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,790
-It fell!
-Let me see

669
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,670
Take a selfie with someone you like

670
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,070
with your mobile phone

671
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,270
Who?

672
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,910
[Here comes the Easter egg]

673
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,270
I go out for a while

674
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,430
Let's go
