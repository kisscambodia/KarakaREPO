Bad news from backstage!

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,780
Sis!


6
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,940
What are you doing?


7
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,820
I'm going to work backstage.	


8
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,420
Mind your own business.


9
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,140
Sis,


10
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,700
grandma told me before I came here that	


11
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,980
you can't go to any crowded place.


12
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,380
Let go!


13
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,140

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,180
I'm here to take care of you, 


15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,620

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,340

18
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,420
If you try to make an issue of me,


19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,460
I'll show no mercy.


20
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,490
Sis, don't get me wrong.


21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,340
I just do


22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,810
what grandma tells me to do.


23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,860
It better be.


24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,780
Don't worry, sis.


25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,380
I'll take good care of you.


26
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,660
Although


27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,340
I have my own plans,


28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,100

Behave yourself.


32
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,290
Don't interfere with my business.


33
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,300

I'm telling you,


37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,580
 you're done. 


38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,660
You'll never work as a model again!


39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,700
If it's our fault, 


40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,340

41
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,180
But please show some respect to our model.

on this dress.


44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,260
And you ruined it!


45
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,900
And you're talking about respect? 


46
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,060
Talk to my lawyer!

What's going on?	


48
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,290
Someone ripped Qianying's dress.


49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,700
It was bustling here.


50
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,260
We don't know who did it.


51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,100
Annie, 


52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,780
you must solve this matter.


53
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,660
I spent a whole year


54
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
on this dress


55
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,780
and half a year


56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,980
on this show.


57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,300
If it's ruined,


58
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,700
I'll...


59
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,140
I'll sue you!


60
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,900
I didn't do it...Not me.


61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,780
An Zi,


62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,340
we're old friends. 


63
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,860
Give me some time.


64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,060
So someone did it on purpose.


65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,170
I'm going to check them out one by one.


66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,780
There's no point of doing that at this moment.


67
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,540
The priority is to fix the dress


68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,060
 and ensure that Qianying can go on stage.


69
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,940
Otherwise, 


70
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,860
we'll be deemed as unprofessional.


71

An Zi,


72
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,579
I'm afraid


73
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,020
 your dress is about to take on a new look.


74
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,540
How?


75
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,460
How will you present it?


76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,420
I've already


77
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,340
seen the tear of the dress.


78
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,940
Even if you sew it back,


79
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,700
the lines are not as smooth as before.


80
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,060
There's only one option now.


81
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,140
We must change the look.


82
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Change?


83
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,579
I've put my heart and soul into this dress.


84
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,060
How can you just change it?


85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,980
I know this dress means a lot to you.


86
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,420
That's why I'm proposing this.


87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,330
If you don't change it now


88
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,780
because you're in a fit of anger,


89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,340
we both know the consequences.

94
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,380
all I'll lose is a model


95
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,740
 and the liquidated damages with Gu's Group.


96

The changed look is not bad,


112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
but my design is still better.

563
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,460
Su Bei, don't announce the divorce yet.


564
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,460
I've found something important! 


565
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,220
I'm sorry. 


566
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,460
We were interrupted


567
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,700
 by a technical glitch.


568
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,140
So let's move on


569
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,580
and hear Ms. Su Bei's story


570
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,940
of her relationship


571
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,750
with Mr. Lu Nan.


572
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,780
You just asked me why I came back.


573
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,980
I came back because I wanted to


574
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,660
clear up the misunderstanding


575
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,060
 I had with Mr. Lu seven years ago


576
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,540
and to make up for the mistakes we made 	


577
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,420
when we were young and stupid.


578
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,380
As for the online rumors


579
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,740
about our disputes,


580
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,340
I'd like to tell you that


581
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,340
Mr. Lu is my partner


582
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,180
 and lover for the rest of my life.


583
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,060
Have you cleared up the misunderstanding


584
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,220
 between you and Mr. Lu now?


585
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,220
Misunderstandings were just misunderstandings.


586
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,700
We won't be bothered by them anymore.


587
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:23,640
[Yun Fan]


588
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,100
Su Bei came back to avenge Yu Qinglan's accident 


589
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,420
and to destroy Eminence and you.


590
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,250
Su Su, this is the man	


591
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,460
 who drove an Audi in and out of the factory


592
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,620
 on the day of the fire.


593
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,710
[Personnel Information]


594
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,300
But the factory's cameras were damaged, 


595
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,180
so no video of him was kept.


596
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,540
This photo was taken


597
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,740
by the camera in the kiosk


598
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,220
 near the factory.


599
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,340
What is yours will always be yours.


600
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,980
 If it's not, don't be obsessed with it.


601
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,900
Yezi, I'm so tired.


602
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,980
I feel like


603
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,100
 a fool.


604
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,060
Su Su, don't.


605
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,380
 It's not your fault.


606
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,650
Although Lu Nan wanted to 


607
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,660
acquire Auntie Lan's company at the beginning,


608
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,620
he mortgaged it instead.


609
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,050
They transferred a deposit, 


610
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,140
but the money 


611
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,540
went back to Eminence in the end,


612
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,260
and his relationship with Zhang Yuan, 


613
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,660
and the Fragrance Brocade you found in his wardrobe


614
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,700
and the recording I received.


615
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,460
Anyone would have been confused


616
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,740
by all these things.


617
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,860
What exactly happened?


618
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,420
Who was behind it?


619
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,540
And what role


620
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,940
 was Gu Chengze playing?


621
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,580
I'm so confused. 


622
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,780
I feel like my head is about to explode.


623
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,420
Su Su...


624
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,220
How am I supposed to face him?	


625
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,140
I have a date with him tonight.


626
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,380
Let's go to the restaurant.	


627
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,860
- OK.
- Go.

♫ To see you ♫


648
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,260

or you hate me and come back for revenge.

When you protected me at the bar and


695

held on to Eminence while I was in a coma, 


696
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,180
was that a sign of love 


697
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,780
