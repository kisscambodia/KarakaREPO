18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,519
I may not

19
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,839
know you very well.

20
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:38,599
But I'm sure about one thing.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,225
That is,

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,200
you're a very good doctor.

23
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,025
A doctor heals the wounded

24
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:01,450
and rescues the dying.

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,825
Since I was an intern,

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,725
totally 15 patients have died,

27
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:08,950
regardless of my treatment.

28
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,325
I still remember

29
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:13,805
what they look like.

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,950
But now,

31
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:21,150
I even failed to save
my most respected teacher.

32
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,550
Do you still think I'm a good doctor?

33
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,275
Of course.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,750
My grandfather was a doctor
of traditional Chinese medicine.

35
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,200
He told us

36
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,080
that many people think

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,650
doctors can remain indifferent

38
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,875
to death.

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,025
But actually, no one

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,350
can be indifferent to death.

41
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:46,625
When ordinary guys like us
see a dying man,

42
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,106
our first reaction is sympathy.

43
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,575
But when a doctor sees the man,

44
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,550
he thinks of whether he can save him
and how he can save him.

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,325
The doctor fulfills his duty
if he saves lives.

46
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,759
He also fulfills his duty if he fails.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
So, Dr. Gu,

48
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:02,925
you've tried your best.

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,925
Like I just said,

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,199
in my heart,

51
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,550
you're a very good doctor.

52
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,225
However...

53
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,960
I guess

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,450
you want to be a better doctor.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,450
Before you become a better doctor,

56
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,119
don't break down.

57
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,500
Come on.

58
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,399
Lin Zhixiao.

59
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,025
Mm?

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Many people tried to comfort me
with many reasons.

61
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,950
But no one talked like you.

62
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:33,475
They did?

63
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,225
I'm quite outstanding

64
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:36,945
and unique, aren't I?

65
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,625
A little bit.

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,650
Who's there?

67
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:42,400
Run, run.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,520
Didn't you say
climbing through the window

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,325
can be a tradition of the Music Academy?

70
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,759
If I'm caught, I'll receive
a disciplinary record.

71
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,600
I haven't graduated yet.

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,160
Stop, stop!

73
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:10,880
Lin Zhixiao,

74
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:11,960
you were just wounded.

75
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,150
Could you walk more carefully?

76
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:14,850
It's for you.

77
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:16,720
Dr. Gu,

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,325
you're off work, okay?

79
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,850
Besides, even though I was wounded,

80
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,150
I climbed through the window
and even ran today.

81
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,750
Never mind.

82
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,800
Come on. Let me be happy.

83
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,175
Have some Pepsi.

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,519
Cheers.

85
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,275
You don't want it?

86
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,250
I'll drink it first, then.

87
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Tastes great.

88
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,750
Just taste it.

89
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,600
Come on, Dr. Gu.

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,975
Doesn't it feel great?

91
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,880
Just so-so.

92
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:20,450
Would you like some music?

93
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:35,125
Oh, dear.

94
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,119
Dr. Gu,

95
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,300
a big twist.

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,200
My teacher just texted me

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,475
that I could return to the orchestra

98
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:41,600
and continue as a cellist.

99
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
As long as I keep practicing hard,

100
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,079
I will be able to join the concert.

101
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,275
The wound on my head is indeed useful.

102
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Lin Zhixiao,

103
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,760
what does your wound

104
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,850
have anything to do

105
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,850
with your teacher's decision?

106
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,720
It has a lot to do with it.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,875
It's heaven-sent compensation.

108
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,825
It's like magic. You don't understand.

109
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,075
I indeed don't understand.

110
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,825
Why not let go of me?

111
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,325
Sorry.

112
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,100
I was just too excited.

113
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,519
It's okay.

114
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,125
If you want to disinfect...

115
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
...your hands,

116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,079
just do it.

117
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,200
I won't think
you're discriminating against me.

118
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,350
Look at you.

119
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,839
How can you be in a relationship?

120
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,000
You can't even hold a girl's hands.

121
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,050
What did you say?

122
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,450
No... nothing.

123
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,725
I said nothing.

124
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,775
Actually,

125
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,350
in a relationship,

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,450
there are solutions.

127
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,000
There's a crack in everything.

128
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,549
That's how the light gets in.

129
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,750
There's a crack in everything.

130
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,875
That's how the light gets in.

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
See?

132
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:41,400
As long as you don't give up,

133
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,175
there's always a miracle.

134
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,375
Right?

135
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,750
Are you sure you want another round?

136
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,400
I never give in

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,775
on two things.

138
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,840
First, my charm.

139
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,175
Second, my capacity for liquor.

140
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't regret it, idiot.

141
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
I won't.

142
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,600
Wait.

143
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:10,599
Let me taste it.

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,825
Why does it taste different?

145
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,475
Let me taste it again.

146
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,825
Isn't it sparkling water?

147
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,400
Should I complain about it

148
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,650
to China Consumers Association?

149
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,150
Let's challenge the real wine.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,825
Do you dare?

151
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,825
A bottle of whisky, please.

152
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,500
Wei?

153
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:14,599
Madam.

154
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,239
Madam.

155
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,679
Here. Have some tea.

156
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,479
Thank you.

157
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,875
Wei,

158
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,475
it's been long since you last came in.

159
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,775
I know

160
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
you often come

161
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,599
and see me from outside.

162
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,250
You just didn't come in.

163
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,425
Wei,

164
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:51,300
there was nothing wrong

165
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,699
with your operation proposal.

166
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,925
It was just an accident.

167
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,479
If your teacher

168
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,125
wanted to tell you something,

169
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,550
he would ask you
not to blame yourself or feel sad

170
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,275
for that accident.

171
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:10,975
Madam,

172
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,925
may I read my teacher's books?

173
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,300
Go ahead.

174
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,750

175
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,325

as one of the top therapies.)

(Never forget why you started.)

179
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:05,760
I swear

180
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,159
I'll try my best

181
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,675
to take medical measures

182
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,900
that I believe are beneficial
to patients.

183
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,025
I won't bring pain or damage to them.

184
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:22,250
(Never forget why you started.)
I'll work and live blamelessly.

185
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:31,446
From now on,

186
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,159
you must keep in mind

187
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,479
that you decide

188
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,960
the lives and health of many people.

189
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,320
However,

190
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,919
don't forget

191
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,825
that medicine isn't a perfect science,

192
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:45,200
but a changeable

193
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,400
and elusive knowledge system.

194
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,700
There's always a gap

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,840
between our pursuits and goals.

196
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,075
Make the gap encourage you,

197
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,955
instead of crushing you.

198
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,479
Because doctors

199
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,000
don't fight alone.

200
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,175
Instead, they keep making

201
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:03,320
human-centered progress.

202
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:07,039
I hope you'll never forget
why you started

203
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,520
and your mission will be accomplished.

204
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,679
Mr. Lin.

205
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,400
Mm?

206
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,300
Time for lunch.

207
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,350
Oh.

208
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,325
I hear you were wounded.

209
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,159
Just a flesh wound. No big deal.

210
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,300
No big deal.

211
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,525
Where were you wounded?

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's not a big problem.

213
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,500
Just a hit on the head.

214
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,799
Let me check.

215
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,919
That's not necessary.

216
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,125
Let me check.

217
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:43,000
Fine. Fine.

218
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,559
See?

219
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,150
Just this. It's okay.

220
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,719
Put your fringe down.

221
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,280
What?

222
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,950
You revealed your imperfect face.

223
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,125
Mr. Lin,

224
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm your daughter, all right?

225
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,400
It's all because of your genes.

226
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,320
We both have imperfect faces.

227
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,625
Let's not complain
about each other, okay?

228
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,275
You've got good genes, too.

229
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,075
Did you get your dimples by yourself?

230
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,275
Fine, I got them from you.

231
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:11,799
Dr. Gu.

232
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,700
Dr. Gu.

233
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,330
I came to check on Qiuqiu.

234
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,065
Mm.

235
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,950
Dr. Gu.

236
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,039
Come on, Qiuqiu.

237
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,725
Let me check your wound.

238
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,475
Does it still hurt?

239
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:27,039
No.

240
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,280
The wound heals well.

241
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,575
The operation was successful, too.

242
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,175
When he actively accepts our treatment,

243
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,039
he can have the stitches removed
and leave hospital in two weeks.

244
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,640
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

245
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,900
We're indeed grateful to you.

246
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,700
It's my duty.

247
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,640
Qiuqiu,

248
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,440
you will leave hospital in good health.

249
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,475
Are you happy about it?

250
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:41,799
However,

251
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,725
have you finished your homework?

252
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,600
Son, don't be a coward.

253
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,350
I'll take my leave.

254
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,775
Okay. See you.

255
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,175
Have some more. You ate so little.

256
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,425
Have some more. Here.

257
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,075
Let me play with you.

258
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:14,679
How do you feel?

259
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,950
Does it still hurt?

260
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,039
No. I'm rough.

261
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,150
It doesn't hurt at all now.

262
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,000
In a couple of weeks,

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,799
if I pass the test

264
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,200
and can join the concert,

265
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,900
may I invite you to watch it?

266
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,650
Mm.

267
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,359
In a couple of days,

268
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,599
come to me
and have the stitches removed.

269
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:30,300
Okay.

270
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,525
Deal.

271
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,599
Deal.

272
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,039
I gotta go.

273
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:36,799
Wait a second.

274
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:39,679
I have something to tell you.

275
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,650
What... what is it?

276
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,050
I've decided

277
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,725
to give an operation to my father.

278
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,350
To...

279
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,325
To my father?

280
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:58,280
But you...

281
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,975
What about your psychological disorder?

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,650
I never joke about a patient's life.

283
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:10,440
Thank... Thank you, Dr. Gu.

284
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,450
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

285
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
Oh, you...

286
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,150
You want me to check your hand?

287
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,800
It's very steady.

288
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,080
Very steady. It doesn't shake at all.

289
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,880
Good.

290
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,159
I've been confirming this

291
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,280
over the days.

292
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,280
Don't worry.

293
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,350
I'll do my best.

294
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,175
Dr. Gu,

295
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,000
I trust you.

296
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,325
And,

297
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,000
thank you.

298
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:40,440
Qiuqiu, look at your grandpa.

299
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,275
Qiuqiu.

300
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,359
I'll arrange the distal gastrectomy

301
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,325
as soon as possible.

302
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,320
The tissues to be removed

303
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,320
will be adjusted

304
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,275
according to the operation condition.

305
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,280
But don't worry.

306
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll reserve as many body tissues

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,275
as I can.

308
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
I understand.

309
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,239
But it's a cancer operation, after all.

310
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,875
Will it be risky

311
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,500
for my father's health?

312
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,850
Any kind of operation can be risky,

313
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,050
not to mention such a big one.

314
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,719
During the operation,

315
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,650
there are all kinds of emergencies, too.

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,400
As a doctor, I can't

317
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,550
assure you anything.

318
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,375
But please rest assured.

319
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,900
I'll do my best.

320
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,500
Dr. Gu,

321
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,375
I'll count on you

322
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:29,875
for my father's operation.

323
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:53,079
I've checked the gastroscopy report.

324
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,560
The stomach ulcer looks special.

325
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,800
In my experience,

326
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,300
you'd better take another checkup.

327
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,775
Be careful. Don't cut your hand.

328
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,119
I won't.

329
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,959
It was you
who said those frightening things

330
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,239
to my family
or they wouldn't be in a panic.

331
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,199
If something happens to you one day,

332
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,719
your family will feel guilty
for the rest of their lives.

333
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,800
I know my condition very well.

334
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
I'm all right.

335
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,800
Right, right.

336
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,640
We're just too worried.

337
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,350
I just saw your daughter crying.

338
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,700
The apple looks funny.

339
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,959
Lin,

340
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,280
why don't you eat the apple?

341
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,375
Eat it.

342
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,454
Or you can't have the second one.

343
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,581
We're like two psychos.

344
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:33,719
The tissues to be removed

345
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,719
will be adjusted

346
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,359
according to the operation condition.

347
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,725
But don't worry.

348
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,199
I'll reserve as many body tissues

349
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,600
as I can.

350
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,225
Here. Get your Ultraman.

351
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:07,750
Huijuan.

352
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:10,900
Lin Zhixiao.

353
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,280
Lin Zhixiao.

354
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,375
Lin Zhixiao?

355
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,599
He's awake.

356
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,800
Honey, you're awake?

357
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,119
What's wrong with you?

358
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,079
When I woke up,

359
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,525
no one was around!

360
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,750
When you were asleep,

361
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,675
I went out for only a few minutes.

362
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,839
I went home to make soup for you.

363
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,560
I was held up in traffic
on my way back here.

364
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,520
When you were away,

365
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,839
what if something happened to me?

366
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,900
Who would take care of me?

367
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:58,050
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

368
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,119
Do you think

369
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,375
you're having a hard time

370
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,296
accompanying me in the hospital?

371
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,025
Go back home, then!

372
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,300
We would never think like that.

373
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,800
All right. All right.

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,839
I'll then tell you

375
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,925
wherever I go.

376
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,680
Zhixiao made some soup for you.

377
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,640
Try a drop.

378
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,675
I have no appetite. I won't want any.

379
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,650
Have some.

380
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,719
You haven't had anything to eat today.

381
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,725
- I said no. Don't annoy me!
- Just have some.

382
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,375
What are you doing, honey?

383
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,300
Clean... Clean it up.

384
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:34,525
Lie there and cool down.

385
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,319
I'll go get the mop

386
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,550
and clean the floor.

387
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:40,880
Go, Ms. Li.

388
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,275
Go, go.

389
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,119
Zhixiao,

390
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,350
don't be angry with your father.

391
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:56,675
Why would I be angry with him?

392
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,760
He's sick and in a bad mood.

393
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,000
I won't be angry with him.

394
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,075
Why was he acting so weirdly
without a reason?

395
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,250
Did he know it already?

396
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,300
You mean his real problem?

397
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,900
Mm.

398
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,050
No, no. He wouldn't know.

399
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,400
Dr. Gu promised me

400
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,275
that he would keep the secret.

401
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:20,520
Dr. Gao agreed, too.

402
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,439
The doctors will say

403
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,850
it's just an operation
for stomach ulcer.

404
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,719
Everything will be all right.

405
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,650
Don't worry.

406
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,150
Don't you know it's harmful

407
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,079
to your stomach and the other organs?

408
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,125
Don't you know that?

409
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,650
I just...

410
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm gonna turn this place upside down.

411
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
If I find one more cigarette,

412
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,560
you're dead!

413
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,425
But it's a cancer operation, after all.

414
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,839
Will it

415
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,640
be risky

416
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,560
for my father's health?

417
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,800
Any kind of operation can be risky.

418
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,719
During the operation,

419
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,600
there are all kinds of emergencies, too.

420
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,560
As a doctor, I can't

421
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,800
assure you anything.

422
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,575
But please rest assured.

423
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,975
I'll do my best.

424
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:43,880
Xiaowei,

425
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,175
- how's it going with the patient file?
- Oh, Dr. Gu.

426
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:47,575
Here's the operation consent
of the patient in Bed 9.

427
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,050
Thanks.

428
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,839
She hung up on me again.

429
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,040
She's even more heartless than me.

430
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,199
I haven't touched anything.

431
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,119
I was just too tired of standing.

432
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,079
I couldn't hold it
and then sat for a while.

433
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,275
If you're not okay with it,

434
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,875
disinfect your chair.

435
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,400
Forget it.

436
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,079
What brings you here?

437
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,725
Do you really think I wanted to come?

438
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,160
Your mother,

439
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,350
namely my dear aunt,

440
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:27,880
said you didn't go home for days

441
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,750
and no one could get you home.

442
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,850
I have to take you back home today,
no matter what.

443
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:34,119
In recent days,

444
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,239
I've indeed been busy.

445
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,719
But what meal can we have
at this time of day?

446
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,079
Dinner or midnight snack?

447
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,525
That's not my concern.

448
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,920
You know your mother's temper.

449
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,400
If you don't go home, she'll kill me.

450
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,079
Go, go, go.

451
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,119
Go back home quickly.

452
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,125
Go, go.

453
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,959
After you.

454
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,125
Fine.

455
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,175
Let me get changed first.

456
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:03,280
I have to follow you.

457
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,325
Honey, get to sleep early.

458
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:08,565
You'll have the operation tomorrow.

459
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,975
You can't eat anything
after 9:00 PM.

460
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,400
Got it.

461
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
His family shall come
to the nurse station with me.

462
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,175
I'll tell you some dos and don'ts

463
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:17,525
for tomorrow's operation.

464
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:18,100
Oh.

465
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,950
Mom, you go with her.

466
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,550
Okay.

467
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
Lin Zhixiao,

468
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:23,200
go with your mother.

469
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,440
Don't miss anything.

470
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,160
Fine. Fine.

471
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,700
I'll go. I will.

472
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,575
Qiuqiu, have fun by yourself.

473
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,700
You're back? Come on in.

474
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,300
I knocked off early.

475
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,350
So,

476
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,775
I came to help Aunt with dinner.

477
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,760
But you...

478
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,225
You haven't married him yet.

479
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:52,079
What a family!

480
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,119
You're already cold, Wei.

481
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,000
With another cold person,

482
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,520
your home will be like an ice house.

483
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,500
I invited Xi.

484
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,439
Mom.

485
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,119
Aunt.

486
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,800
Mm.

487
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,575
Go wash your hands.

488
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:09,000
Seven steps of hand washing.
I know that.

489
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,750
I have to do this every time I come.

490
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:22,880
Yes.

491
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
We all have to
get to sleep early tonight.

492
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,800
Where's he?

493
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,850
Qiuqiu,

494
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,400
did you see Grandpa Lin?

495
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,925
He went out just now.

496
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,599
He even hushed me,

497
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,100
asking me not to make a sound.

498
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,675
How long has he been out?

499
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,250
For a long while.

500
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,700
Zhixiao, come and check this.

501
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,250
(Huijuan, I'm leaving.
The password of my bank card is 181012.)

502
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,280
What does this mean?

503
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,875
I'll go call him first.

504
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:53,075
I'll...

505
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,950
- I'll check the toilet.
- Check if he's in the toilet.

506
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
- Is he in there?
- No.

507
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,075
Hurry. Let's check out there.

508
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,025
Gu Wei's father
has an operation to give.

509
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,175
Let's not wait for him.

510
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:08,040
Let's enjoy dinner.

511
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,875
- Okay.
- Okay.

512
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,425
Use the serving chopsticks.

513
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,075
Here, Xi.

514
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,235
- Thank you, Aunt.
- Have some more.

515
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,479
Here, Wei.

516
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,725
Have some more.

517
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,050
Xi,

518
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,525
you've been

519
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,204
Gu Wei's colleague in MDT.

520
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,719
Are there any new cases lately?

521
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:30,400
A patient with Phase II stomach cancer
was diagnosed

522
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,239
after Gu Wei urged him
to have a recheck.

523
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,600
Now, the patient is

524
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,161
preparing for the operation.

525
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:37,850
He is?

526
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,900
Then you should have
good cooperation.

527
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:44,199
That young guys like you help each other

528
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,275
and care about each other

529
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,750
will be the best thing.

530
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:48,079
Wei,

531
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,925
what is MDT?

532
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,280
Mountain Daylight Time.

533
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,850
That's MDT.

534
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,599
I'm not an idiot.

535
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,150
Three doctors like you
wouldn't talk about daylight time.

536
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:04,199
Focus on dinner.

537
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:09,195
Xi.

538
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:09,850
Mm?

539
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,560
I always like you.

540
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,880
For young guys like you,

541
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,175
career is important.

542
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,239
But you also have to think about

543
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,875
the family issue.

544
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,719
You and Gu Wei have known for years.

545
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:25,225
And you two get along very well.

546
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:27,750
Don't always talk about work.

547
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
You should also communicate more

548
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,025
about family life.

549
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,719
Gu Wei can't take good care of himself.

550
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,160
He's too busy to care about himself,

551
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,920
just like his father.

552
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,075
Pay attention to him on my behalf.

553
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,850
I will, Aunt.

554
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,300
Have more shrimps.

555
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,900
Mm.

556
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,375
Mom, excuse me.

557
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:00,479
Hello. What's up?

558
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,599
Dr. Gu,

559
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:03,560
the patient of Bed 9
left the hospital without permission.

560
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,719
We can't reach him now.

561
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,450
I'll let his family

562
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,850
explain to you.

563
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:07,625
Mm.

564
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,625
Here.

565
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,599
Dr. Gu, it's me, Lin Zhixiao.

566
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,839
I'm sorry to disturb you this late.

567
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,800
Here's the thing.

568
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:14,125
Have more fish.

569
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,125
- Mm.
- Have some more.

570
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,175
- Aunt, I also want...
- Have some more, too.

571
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:17,400
Lin Zhixiao, listen.

572
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,719
First, calm down.

573
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,775
The hospital is big.
Don't look for him blindly.

574
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,875
Ask Du Wenjun to apply for you

575
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,275
so that you can check the security tape.

576
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:25,975
I'm going back immediately.

577
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,625
I'll be arriving in about a quarter.

578
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:28,680
Don't do anything else

579
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:29,800
until I'm back there.

580
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,175
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Gu.

581
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:32,239
Okay. Okay.

582
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,119
What did he say?

583
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,160
Dr. Gu said

584
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,880
you could apply for us

585
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,520
to check the security tape.

586
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,350
Fine. Let's go immediately.

587
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,950
- Okay.
- Yes.

588
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,920
- Go.
- Hurry.

589
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,719
It's okay. It's okay.

590
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,400
This way.

591
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,199
Gao Xi,

592
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,680
Lin Jianguo of Bed 9
left the hospital without permission.

593
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,119
What he left indicates
a suicidal tendency.

594
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,479
I'm going back with you.

595
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,025
Aunt, enjoy the dinner without us.

596
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:48,275
But...

597
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,880
Mom, I gotta go.

598
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,825
Wei, Wei...

599
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,125
Now,

600
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:03,175
no one is here, but me.

601
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,280
Fine. Enjoy your dinner.

602
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,680
Okay. Okay.

603
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,119
Have some more.

604
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,000
Dr. Gu.

605
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,199
- What happened?
- Dr. Gu is back.

606
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,439
Have you reached him?

607
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,225
First, he didn't answer the phone.

608
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:25,920
Later, he even turned off his phone.

609
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,040
We checked the security tape.

610
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
Mr. Lin has indeed left the hospital.

611
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,959
But we don't know where he has gone.

612
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,199
There's a strict processing program

613
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,359
for patients who leave the hospital
without permission.

614
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,199
Gao Xi, report it to the man on duty.

615
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,375
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

616
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,560
Don't worry.

617
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,160
Think carefully

618
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,650
about where Mr. Lin may possibly go.

619
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:41,040
Where can he go?

620
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,650
Shall I go back home and check?

621
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,760
Fine. You go back home.

622
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,839
I'll look for him nearby.

623
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,640
- Let's keep informed.
- Okay.

624
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,520
Okay. Okay.

625
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,525
Calm down.

626
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,959
Dr. Gu,

627
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,959
- I'll go look for him.
- Mm.

628
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,479
Get in the car.
I'll take you to find him.

629
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,359
Dr. Gu,

630
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,225
you must be tired after a day's work.

631
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm sorry

632
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,560
- It doesn't matter.
- to disturb you...

633
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,160
Mr. Lin is my patient.

634
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,839
I'm his surgeon.

635
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm obligated to supervise him.

636
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,225
Thank you.

637
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,800
Excuse me.

638
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,175
Hello, Mom. What have you got?

639
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:45,079
I'm back home,

640
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,479
but your father isn't home.

641
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,600
He isn't home?

642
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:49,599
Calm down, Ms. Li.

643
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,839
Mr. Lin can't be

644
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,000
an irresponsible man.

645
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,160
Trust me, okay?

646
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
I will find him.

647
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,000
Don't worry.

648
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,079
I'll let you know when I find him.

649
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:56,920
I'll hang up.

650
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,775
Mr. Lin isn't home.

651
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:06,350
Where has he gone?

652
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,439
Hello.

653
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,400
He's a mature man.

654
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,002
Why did he go out
in the middle of the night?

655
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,800
Doesn't he know we're worried?

656
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm sorry

657
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,119
to call you when it's so late.

658
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,750
Is my husband with you?

659
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,439
Sorry. Bye.

660
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,400
When he's out there alone,

661
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,319
what if he has a stomachache?

662
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,880
He can't take care of himself at all.

663
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,680
Maybe... Maybe his phone died.

664
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,300
I'll try some other way.

665
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,400
And he left such a note.

666
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,350
What will he do?
What on earth will he do?

667
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:48,725
Lin Zhixiao.

668
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,750
What's wrong, Lin Zhixiao?

669
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,640
I'm fine.

670
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm just having a painful period.

671
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:58,050
What?

672
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,959
Bear with it.

673
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,850
I'll find a place to pull over.

674
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,375
Hang in there.

675
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,250
(Suning)

676
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,079
Wait for me.

677
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:27,475
(Suning)

678
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,800
Put my coat on.

679
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:44,672
(Small pack)

680
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:46,179
(Kotex, small pack)

681
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:47,475
(Kotex, for girls)

682
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,310
Are you picking this
for your girlfriend?

683
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,640
Try this.

684
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,125
It's small and portable.

685
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,520
It's very popular lately.

686
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:09,959
Thank you.

687
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:19,639
Sir, there's a promotion.

688
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,250
You'll get a small gift for this tampon.

689
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,125
Let me pack it for you.

690
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,080
Thanks.

691
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,120
By the way,

692
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,650
what does a girl

693
00:34:31,975 --> 00:34:33,320
usually need

694
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,525
for a...?

695
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:37,479
For a painful period?

696
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:38,725
Buy some warmer pads.

697
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,639
Thank you. Put them in.

698
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,239
Oh, and a hot drink, too.

699
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,000
Thank you.

700
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:48,550
You care so much for your girlfriend.

701
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:49,800
(Kotex, small pack)
Yeah.

702
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,639
I'm so jealous of your girlfriend.

703
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,075
(Suning)

704
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,350
Thank you.

705
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,280
This is for you.

706
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:25,075
(Kotex, small pack)

707
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:32,639
I... I feel much better now.

708
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,840
I'm all right.

709
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,639
Let's go look for Mr. Lin.

710
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,000
You're quite weak now.

711
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,040
How can you find him?

712
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:41,550
Do you know where he usually goes?

713
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:47,850
What you have to do now is

714
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,959
to relax

715
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,560
and ease the tension.

716
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,550
The tension will...

717
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,919
It will give you

718
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,360
a more painful period.

719
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:05,575
Don't you have

720
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,320
professional advice for a painful period

721
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,975
as a doctor?

722
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm afraid

723
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,159
I even know less about it than you.

724
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,320
If you really want some advice,

725
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,360
I can only advise you

726
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,760
to drink more hot water. Drink it up.

727
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,150
Take a good rest.

728
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:35,000
After you recover,

729
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,439
we'll continue to look for your father.

730
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:50,875
Lin Zhixiao.

731
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,525
Mm?

732
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,639
Why haven't I ever heard you

733
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,325
call Mr. Lin Dad?

734
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:02,625
When I was at school,

735
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,475
I climbed over the wall
to skip classes for fun.

736
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,575
But I was caught.

737
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,120
I was given a disciplinary record.

738
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,125
I then begged my father.

739
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,000
I said, Dad...

740
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,475
But Mr. Lin said,

741
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,375
don't call me Dad.

742
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,300
Call me Mr. Lin!

743
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,950
I remember that day,

744
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,750
even the grade director
interceded for me.

745
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:30,120
He offered an oral warning.

746
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,560
But Mr. Lin rejected.

747
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,900
Forced by him,

748
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,125
I read my self-criticism
at the flag-raising ceremony

749
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,800
in front of the whole school.

750
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:45,600
From that day on,

751
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,520
I've never called him Dad.

752
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,700
I've been calling him Mr. Lin.

753
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:54,520
Looks like Mr. Lin

754
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,439
has always been strict with you.

755
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,399
Not strict,

756
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,439
but harsh.

757
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,159
Do you know
what's the most horrible thing

758
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,875
for a little child?

759
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:10,525
That his father is also his teacher.

760
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,950
Mr. Lin is my father and teacher.

761
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,639
Whenever I got up late,

762
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,000
he would first scold me at home.

763
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,425
When I got to school,

764
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:22,879
he then punished me

765
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,239
to run laps

766
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,700
as the dean.

767
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,900
Horrible, isn't it?

768
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,320
I remember one year,

769
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,875
my birthday wish was

770
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,525
that my biological father
would come to get me.

771
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:41,879
Then he would say,

772
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:44,616
Lin Jianguo isn't your real father.

773
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:47,479
I was nine years old

774
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,775
when I made the wish, I remember.

775
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,750
That day, I even ran away from home.

776
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,320
Why?

777
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,375
Because Mr. Lin was too busy

778
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,520
to celebrate my birthday

779
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,679
and he even scolded me.

780
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,280
In a fit of anger, I ran away from home.

781
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,679
I remember that I walked

782
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,679
and walked

783
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,800
until I reached a small river.

784
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,800
I piled a little cake for myself

785
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
with the dirt

786
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,925
and made a wish.

787
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,125
You ran away from home
when you were so young.

788
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,280
Your parents must have panicked.

789
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,200
They did, I guess.

790
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,000
Do you think

791
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,000
when Mr. Lin found me,

792
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,679
he would hug me,

793
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:32,275
weep disconsolately,

794
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,280
and apologize to me,

795
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,875
saying he shouldn't have scolded me

796
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,550
and would be nice to me?

797
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:41,280
He didn't?

798
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,775
I remember when he found me,

799
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,100
he rushed up

800
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,919
and kicked me over.

801
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,450
Then he pointed at my nose, yelling,

802
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:57,760
Lin Zhixiao,

803
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,959
if you dare to run away again,

804
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,520
I'll break your legs!

805
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:06,199
Since that day,

806
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,439
there has been a curfew in my family.

807
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:10,375
I can't go anywhere after 6:00 PM.

808
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,080
He keeps watching me every day.

809
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,350
When I find him,

810
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:22,919
I'll repeat every single word

811
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,719
he once said to me.

812
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,159
Lin Jianguo,

813
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,375
if you dare to run away again,

814
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:32,700
I'll break your legs.

815
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:49,280
We will find him.

816
00:40:58,075 --> 00:40:59,120
Let me hold it for you.

817
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,800
Mom, what have you got?

818
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,850
You... You know what?

819
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,289
I figure out where your father is.

820
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:11,250
Where's he?

821
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,840
I just got a message.

822
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,225
His mobile payment is tied
to my bank card.

823
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:16,679
He bought a train ticket.

824
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:17,625
Now he's at the train station.

825
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,199
I guess he's going to our hometown.

826
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:21,025
The train leaves in 45 minutes.

827
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,400
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

828
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,199
No.

829
00:42:00,825 --> 00:42:01,650
Thank you.

830
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,525
You mustn't smoke here.

831
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:29,775
I know.

832
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:31,159
I just smell it

833
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,439
