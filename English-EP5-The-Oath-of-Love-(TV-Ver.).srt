00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,660
=Episode 5=

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,730
(Dr. Gu, come on!)

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,600
See, I said

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,560
you've met too few setbacks.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,070
In fact,
when you stride over the barrier

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,330
and look back,

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,180
you'll find it's not a big deal.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,980
Each setback is the impetus to move on.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,680
Come on, Dr. Gu.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,480
Dr. Gu,

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,750
you're really a very good doctor

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,050
in my eyes.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,140
Don't give up

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,500
even if you don't do the surgery
for Mr. Lin.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,590
Wei, could you come out for a while?

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,650
Here's an emergency.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,500
My son is suffering so much.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,600
You don't even care about it.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,430
You call yourself doctors?

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,550
But it's normal to bleed
after the surgery.

21
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,860
Dr. Gu has dealt with it.

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,710
- It's not...
- Get away.

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,650
I'm talking to him.

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,070
None of your business.

25
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,180
Please calm down.

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,980
I see, you're Gu Wei.

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,500
You just caused an accident

28
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,070
and killed your teacher.

29
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,390
Mind your words.

30
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,390
How unfortunate

31
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,310
my son is to be here

32
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,230
- when you're on duty.
- Honey.

33
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,550
Honey, our son is fainted out of pain.

34
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,390
Find a way out for my son.

35
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,150
- Stop shouting. Stop shouting.
- Listen,

36
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,260
- I'm gonna complain.
- Sir.

37
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,310
- I'm gonna complain.
- Could you please calm down?

38
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,420
Stop it.

39
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,580
Watch out.

40
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,420
I won't let you go.

41
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,830
Lin Zhixiao.

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,180
Dr. Gu, are you alright?

43
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,250
Lin Zhixiao.

44
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,480
Gosh!

45
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,050
Blood.

46
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,850
Dr. Gu, please be gentle.

47
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,830
I haven't started.

48
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,600
Don't move.

49
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,180
Gently, gently, gently.

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,550
You know it's painful now?

51
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,350
I don't know
whether I should appreciate you

52
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,600
or scold you.

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,550
It was so dangerous.

54
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,300
But you rushed in recklessly.

55
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,800
It's lucky that the cut is not deep.

56
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,350
I saved you anyway,

57
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,000
OK?

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,700
Who is responsible for the wound?

59
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,230
I wish someone

60
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,180
can do the surgery for my dad

61
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,200
for the sake of my injury.

62
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,550
Done.

63
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,980
Does it hurt?

64
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,250
It's OK.

65
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,100
When I was little,

66
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,830
my dad treated me as a boy.

67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,730
The other girls,

68
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,040
if they fell, for example,

69
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,030
their parents would hold them up

70
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,580
and coax.

71
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,130
My dad was like,

72
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,400
Lin Zhixiao,

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,520
get up where you fall.

74
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,050
Just like he did in the office.

75
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,430
Does it hurt

76
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,630
when stitching?

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,880
Are you so afraid of pain?

78
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,790
How's it?

79
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,250
It's cute.

80
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,970
This pig is so cute.

81
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,780
It's a chicken actually.

82
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,150
The nurses of children's ward

83
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,050
taught me when I rotated there.

84
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,500
I felt it looked like a chicken just now,

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,700
but I was embarrassed to say it.

86
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,330
It's a lovely chicken.

87
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,630
You get stitched then.

88
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,080
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

89
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
I'll start now.

90
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,930
Ready.

91
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,100
Hold on, Dr. Gu.

92
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,280
Don't you have to anesthetize me

93
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,220
before stitching?

94
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,500
Lin Zhixiao,

95
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,200
you make the choice.

96
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,180
If you get anesthesia,
it would be four stitches.

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,790
And two stitches without anesthesia.

98
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,600
Make the choice.

99
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,100
Two stitches.

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,700
Come here.

101
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,350
I'll be as gentle as I can.

102
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,200
It will be a little hurt. Hang in there.

103
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,980
OK.

104
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,200
It's almost done.

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,380
OK.

106
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,030
Hang in there.

107
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,940
Dr. Gu.

108
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,480
Your eyes are so beautiful.

109
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,900
It's not painful, right?

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,590
Don't misunderstand. I didn't mean it.

111
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,230
It's just out of aesthetics.

112
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,880
Anything I should mind?

113
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,480
Keep wound out of water
in three days.

114
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,280
Change the medicine every other day.

115
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,080
Come to me to take out the stitches
five days later.

116
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,330
Don't eat spicy food.

117
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,130
It doesn't hurt, does it?

118
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,550
It's done.

119
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,580
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

120
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,330
Mm.

121
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,980
I'm gonna leave.

122
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,220
Bye-bye.

123
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,580
Mind your wound.

124
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,280
OK.

125
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,280
Bye-bye.

126
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,180
The chicken balloon.

127
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,550
I see, you're Gu Wei.

128
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,500
I heard that

129
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,110
you just caused an accident

130
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,900
and killed your teacher.

131
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,260
You're an irresponsible doctor.

132
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,800
Mind your words.

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,300
Dr. Gu.

134
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,230
Are you off duty?

135
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,930
Yes.

136
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,300
Let me take you somewhere.

137
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,700
Well, I'm not going…

138
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,630
- Come on.
- I…

139
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,030
I've saved you.

140
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,140
Do me an honor.

141
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,900
Say it again.

142
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,000
What did you ask me to do?

143
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,480
Climbing through the window.

144
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Climbing through the window?

145
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,700
Take it ease.

146
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,530
This is the tradition
of our Department of Music.

147
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,650
Almost every student has climbed in

148
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,250
through the window to rehearse.

149
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,220
No way, Dr. Gu.

150
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,870
Haven't you ever done something wrong

151
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,000
when you were a student?

152
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,900
I think it's because
there're too little homework

153
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,310
for you students of Department of Music.

154
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,800
Old fogey. Wait here.

155
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,950
Look at me.

156
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,600
Come in.

157
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,260
Dr. Gu.

158
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,460
You're really interesting.

159
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,050
You can get in with one step.

160
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,770
Why are you being so stable outside?

161
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,800
Forget it.

162
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,500
I don't understand

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,580
the good students like you.

164
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,700
Wait for me in the front door.

165
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,580
I'll open the door for you.

166
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,000
(Huaqing University)

167
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,630
Lin Zhixiao.

168
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,550
The door is unlocked.

169
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,350
I don't know it's unlocked today.

170
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,350
Don't you lose your mind by the hurt?

171
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,550
No.

172
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,660
Get in?

173
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,630
How's it?

174
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,900
No one's here.

175
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,300
Is it super atmospheric?

176
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,830
When I was in high school,

177
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,330
I was with poor grades.

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,850
I had no idea what I could do

179
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,830
and whether I could
enter the university.

180
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,870
I almost gave up

181
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,000
until a senior

182
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,880
encouraged me

183
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,580
and pointed the direction for me.

184
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,630
I remember that day,

185
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,080
he took me

186
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,530
to climb in through the window.

187
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,650
He stood up here

188
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,550
and had an agreement with me.

189
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,780
Zhixiao,

190
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,830
when you entered Huaqing University,

191
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,600
we'll cooperate here.

192
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,500
So, you really entered it.

193
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,880
Yes.

194
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,630
From then on, I'll come here

195
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,650
when I come across

196
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,250
any difficulty.

197
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,150
And I will be relieved.

198
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,530
So, Dr. Gu,

199
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,330
I want to share it with you.

200
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,780
OK.

201
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,850
Are you going to play for me?

202
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,110
Hold on.

203
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,750
Thank you, Dr. Gu,

204
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,760
for curing Mr. Lin on time.

205
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,390
I specially chose

206
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,230
this song for you.

207
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,330
Listen to it carefully.

208
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,900
Ready.

209
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,260
How's it? Is it good?

210
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,180
Good.

211
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,260
Dr. Gu.

212
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
Do you know

213
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,580
what my impression on you is?

214
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,400
At first,

215
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,580
I greatly misunderstood you.

216
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,980
Now I don't understand

217
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,200
you very comprehensively,

218
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,010
but I'm sure for one thing,

219
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,430
that

220
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,550
you're a very good doctor.

221
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,590
A doctor heals the wounded

222
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,020
and rescues the dying.

223
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,390
Since I was an intern,

224
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,290
totally 15 patients have died,

225
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,520
regardless of my treatment.

226
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,890
I still remember

227
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,370
what they look like.

228
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,520
But now,

229
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,720
I even failed to save
my most respected teacher.

230
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,120
Do you still think I'm a good doctor?

231
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,840
Of course.

232
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,320
My grandfather was a doctor
of traditional Chinese medicine.

233
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,770
He told us

234
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,650
that many people think

235
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,220
doctors can remain indifferent

236
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,440
to death.

237
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,590
But actually, no one

238
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,920
can be indifferent to death.

239
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,190
When ordinary guys like us
see a dying man,

240
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,670
our first reaction is sympathy.

241
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,140
But when a doctor sees the man,

242
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,120
he thinks of whether he can save him
and how he can save him.

243
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,890
The doctor fulfills his duty
if he saves lives.

244
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,320
He also fulfills his duty if he fails.

245
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,970
So, Dr. Gu,

246
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,490
you've tried your best.

247
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,490
Like I just said,

248
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,760
in my heart,

249
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,120
you're a very good doctor.

250
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,790
However...

251
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,530
I guess

252
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,020
you want to be a better doctor.

253
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,020
Before you become a better doctor,

254
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,680
don't break down.

255
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,070
Come on.

256
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,960
Lin Zhixiao.

257
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,590
Mm?

258
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,770
Many people tried to comfort me
with many reasons.

259
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,520
But no one talked like you.

260
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,040
They did?

261
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,790
I'm quite outstanding

262
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,510
and unique, aren't I?

263
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,190
A little bit.

264
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,220
Who's there?

265
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,970
Run, run.

266
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,090
Didn't you say
climbing through the window

267
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,890
can be a tradition of the Music Academy?

268
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,320
If I'm caught, I'll receive
a disciplinary record.

269
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,170
I haven't graduated yet.

270
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,730
Stop, stop!

271
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,450
Lin Zhixiao,

272
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,530
you were just wounded.

273
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,720
Could you walk more carefully?

274
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,420
It's for you.

275
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,290
Dr. Gu,

276
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,890
you're off work, okay?

277
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,420
Besides, even though I was wounded,

278
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,720
I climbed through the window
and even ran today.

279
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,320
Never mind.

280
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,370
Come on. Let me be happy.

281
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,740
Have some Pepsi.

282
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,080
Cheers.

283
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,840
You don't want it?

284
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,820
I'll drink it first, then.

285
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,570
Tastes great.

286
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,320
Just taste it.

287
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,170
Come on, Dr. Gu.

288
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,540
Doesn't it feel great?

289
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,450
Just so-so.

290
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,020
Would you like some music?

291
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,690
Oh, dear.

292
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,680
Dr. Gu,

293
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,870
a big twist.

294
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,770
My teacher just texted me

295
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,040
that I could return to the orchestra

296
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,170
and continue as a cellist.

297
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,610
As long as I keep practicing hard,

298
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,640
I will be able to join the concert.

299
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,840
The wound on my head is indeed useful.

300
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,210
Lin Zhixiao,

301
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,330
what does your wound

302
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,420
have anything to do

303
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
with your teacher's decision?

304
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,290
It has a lot to do with it.

305
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,440
It's heaven-sent compensation.

306
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,390
It's like magic. You don't understand.

307
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,640
I indeed don't understand.

308
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,390
Why not let go of me?

309
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,890
Sorry.

310
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,670
I was just too excited.

311
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,080
It's okay.

312
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,690
If you want to disinfect...

313
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,450
...your hands,

314
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,640
just do it.

315
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,770
I won't think
you're discriminating against me.

316
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,920
Look at you.

317
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,400
How can you be in a relationship?

318
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,570
You can't even hold a girl's hands.

319
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,620
What did you say?

320
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,020
No... nothing.

321
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,290
I said nothing.

322
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,340
Actually,

323
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,920
in a relationship,

324
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,020
there are solutions.

325
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,570
There's a crack in everything.

326
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,110
That's how the light gets in.

327
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,320
There's a crack in everything.

328
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,440
That's how the light gets in.

329
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,210
See?

330
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,970
As long as you don't give up,

331
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,740
there's always a miracle.

332
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:10,940
Right?

333
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,320
Are you sure you want another round?

334
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,970
I never give in

335
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,340
on two things.

336
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,410
First, my charm.

337
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,740
Second, my capacity for liquor.

338
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,890
Don't regret it, idiot.

339
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,330
I won't.

340
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,170
Wait.

341
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,160
Let me taste it.

342
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,390
Why does it taste different?

343
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,040
Let me taste it again.

344
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,390
Isn't it sparkling water?

345
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,970
Should I complain about it

346
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,220
to China Consumers Association?

347
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,720
Let's challenge the real wine.

348
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,390
Do you dare?

349
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,390
A bottle of whisky, please.

350
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,070
Wei?

351
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,160
Madam.

352
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,800
Madam.

353
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,240
Here. Have some tea.

354
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,040
Thank you.

355
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
Wei,

356
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,040
it's been long since you last came in.

357
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,340
I know

358
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,770
you often come

359
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,160
and see me from outside.

360
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,820
You just didn't come in.

361
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,990
Wei,

362
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,870
there was nothing wrong

363
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,260
with your operation proposal.

364
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,490
It was just an accident.

365
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,040
If your teacher

366
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,690
wanted to tell you something,

367
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,120
he would ask you
not to blame yourself or feel sad

368
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,840
for that accident.

369
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Madam,

370
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,490
may I read my teacher's books?

371
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,870
Go ahead.

373

as one of the top therapies.)

377
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,330
I swear

378
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,720
I'll try my best

379
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,240
to take medical measures

380
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,470
that I believe are beneficial to patients.

381
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,590
I won't bring pain or damage to them.

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,820
(Never forget why you started.)
I'll work and live blamelessly.

383
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,010
From now on,

384
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,720
you must keep in mind

385
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,040
that you decide

386
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,530
the lives and health of many people.

387
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,890
However,

388
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,480
don't forget

389
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,390
that medicine isn't a perfect science,

390
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,770
but a changeable

391
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,970
and elusive knowledge system.

392
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,270
There's always a gap

393
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,410
between our pursuits and goals.

394
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,640
Make the gap encourage you,

395
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
instead of crushing you.

396
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,040
Because doctors

397
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,570
don't fight alone.

398
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,740
Instead, they keep making

399
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,890
human-centered progress.

400
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,600
I hope you'll never forget
why you started

401
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,090
and your mission will be accomplished.

402
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,240
Mr. Lin.

403
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,970
Mm?

404
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,870
Time for lunch.

405
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,920
Oh.

406
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,890
I hear you were wounded.

407
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,720
Just a flesh wound. No big deal.

408
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,870
No big deal.

409
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,090
Where were you wounded?

410
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,570
It's not a big problem.

411
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,070
Just a hit on the head.

412
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,360
Let me check.

413
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,480
That's not necessary.

414
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,690
Let me check.

415
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,570
Fine. Fine.

416
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,120
See?

417
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,720
Just this. It's okay.

418
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Put your fringe down.

419
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,850
What?

420
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,520
You revealed your imperfect face.

421
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,690
Mr. Lin,

422
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,410
I'm your daughter, all right?

423
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,970
It's all because of your genes.

424
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,890
We both have imperfect faces.

425
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,190
Let's not complain
about each other, okay?

426
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,840
You've got good genes, too.

427
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,640
Did you get your dimples by yourself?

428
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,840
Fine, I got them from you.

429
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,360
Dr. Gu.

430
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,270
Dr. Gu.

431
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,900
I came to check on Qiuqiu.

432
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,630
Mm.

433
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,520
Dr. Gu.

434
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,600
Come on, Qiuqiu.

435
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,290
Let me check your wound.

436
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,040
Does it still hurt?

437
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,600
No.

438
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,850
The wound heals well.

439
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,140
The operation was successful, too.

440
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,740
When he actively accepts our treatment,

441
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,600
he can have the stitches removed
and leave hospital in two weeks.

442
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,210
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

443
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,470
We're indeed grateful to you.

444
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,270
It's my duty.

445
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,210
Qiuqiu,

446
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,010
you will leave hospital in good health.

447
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,040
Are you happy about it?

448
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,360
However,

449
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,290
have you finished your homework?

450
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,170
Son, don't be a coward.

451
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,920
I'll take my leave.

452
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,340
Okay. See you.

453
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,740
Have some more. You ate so little.

454
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,990
Have some more. Here.

455
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,640
Let me play with you.

456
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,240
How do you feel?

457
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,520
Does it still hurt?

458
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,600
No. I'm rough.

459
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,720
It doesn't hurt at all now.

460
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,570
In a couple of weeks,

461
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,360
if I pass the test

462
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,770
and can join the concert,

463
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,470
may I invite you to watch it?

464
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,220
Mm.

465
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,920
In a couple of days,

466
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,160
come to me
and have the stitches removed.

467
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,870
Okay.

468
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,090
Deal.

469
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,160
Deal.

470
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,600
I gotta go.

471
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,360
Wait a second.

472
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,240
I have something to tell you.

473
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,220
What... what is it?

474
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,620
I've decided

475
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,290
to give an operation to my father.

476
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,920
To...

477
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,890
To my father?

478
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,850
But you...

479
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,540
What about your psychological disorder?

480
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,220
I never joke about a patient's life.

481
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,010
Thank... Thank you, Dr. Gu.

482
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,020
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

483
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,270
Oh, you...

484
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,720
You want me to check your hand?

485
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,370
It's very steady.

486
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,650
Very steady. It doesn't shake at all.

487
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,450
Good.

488
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,720
I've been confirming this

489
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,850
over the days.

490
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,850
Don't worry.

491
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll do my best.

492
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,740
Dr. Gu,

493
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,570
I trust you.

494
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,890
And,

495
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,570
thank you.

496
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,010
Qiuqiu, look at your grandpa.

497
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,840
Qiuqiu.

498
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,920
I'll arrange the distal gastrectomy

499
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,890
as soon as possible.

500
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,890
The tissues to be removed

501
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,890
will be adjusted

502
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,840
according to the operation condition.

503
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,850
But don't worry.

504
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,570
I'll reserve as many body tissues

505
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,840
as I can.

506
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,530
I understand.

507
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,800
But it's a cancer operation, after all.

508
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,440
Will it be risky

509
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,070
for my father's health?

510
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,420
Any kind of operation can be risky,

511
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,620
not to mention such a big one.

512
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,280
During the operation,

513
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,220
there are all kinds of emergencies, too.

514
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,970
As a doctor, I can't

515
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,120
assure you anything.

516
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,940
But please rest assured.

517
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,470
I'll do my best.

518
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,070
Dr. Gu,

519
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,940
I'll count on you

520
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,440
for my father's operation.

521
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,640
I've checked the gastroscopy report.

522
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,130
The stomach ulcer looks special.

523
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,370
In my experience,

524
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,870
you'd better take another checkup.

525
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,340
Be careful. Don't cut your hand.

526
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,680
I won't.

527
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,520
It was you
who said those frightening things

528
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,800
to my family
or they wouldn't be in a panic.

529
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,760
If something happens to you one day,

530
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,280
your family will feel guilty
for the rest of their lives.

531
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,370
I know my condition very well.

532
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,450
I'm all right.

533
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,370
Right, right.

534
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,210
We're just too worried.

535
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,920
I just saw your daughter crying.

536
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,270
The apple looks funny.

537
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,520
Lin,

538
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,850
why don't you eat the apple?

539
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,940
Eat it.

540
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,020
Or you can't have the second one.

541
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,150
We're like two psychos.

542
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,280
The tissues to be removed

543
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
will be adjusted

544
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,920
according to the operation condition.

545
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,290
But don't worry.

546
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,760
I'll reserve as many body tissues

547
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,170
as I can.

548
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,790
Here. Get your Ultraman.

549
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
Huijuan.

550
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,470
Lin Zhixiao.

551
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,850
Lin Zhixiao.

552
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,940
Lin Zhixiao?

553
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,160
He's awake.

554
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,370
Honey, you're awake?

555
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,680
What's wrong with you?

556
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,640
When I woke up,

557
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,090
no one was around!

558
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,320
When you were asleep,

559
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,240
I went out for only a few minutes.

560
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,400
I went home to make soup for you.

561
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,130
I was held up in traffic
on my way back here.

562
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,090
When you were away,

563
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,400
what if something happened to me?

564
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,470
Who would take care of me?

565
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,620
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

566
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,680
Do you think

567
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,940
you're having a hard time

568
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,860
accompanying me in the hospital?

569
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,590
Go back home, then!

570
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,870
We would never think like that.

571
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,370
All right. All right.

572
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,400
I'll then tell you

573
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,490
wherever I go.

574
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,250
Zhixiao made some soup for you.

575
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,210
Try a drop.

576
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,240
I have no appetite. I won't want any.

577
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,220
Have some.

578
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,280
You haven't had anything to eat today.

579
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,290
- I said no. Don't annoy me!
- Just have some.

580
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,940
What are you doing, honey?

581
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,870
Clean... Clean it up.

582
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,090
Lie there and cool down.

583
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,880
I'll go get the mop

584
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,120
and clean the floor.

585
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,450
Go, Ms. Li.

586
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,840
Go, go.

587
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,680
Zhixiao,

588
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,920
don't be angry with your father.

589
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Why would I be angry with him?

590
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,330
He's sick and in a bad mood.

591
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,570
I won't be angry with him.

592
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,640
Why was he acting so weirdly
without a reason?

593
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,820
Did he know it already?

594
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,870
You mean his real problem?

595
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,470
Mm.

596
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,620
No, no. He wouldn't know.

597
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,970
Dr. Gu promised me

598
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,840
that he would keep the secret.

599
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,090
Dr. Gao agreed, too.

600
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,000
The doctors will say

601
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,420
it's just an operation for stomach ulcer.

602
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,280
Everything will be all right.

603
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,220
Don't worry.

604
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,720
Don't you know it's harmful

605
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,640
to your stomach and the other organs?

606
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,690
Don't you know that?

607
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,220
I just...

608
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,090
I'm gonna turn this place upside down.

609
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,090
If I find one more cigarette,

610
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,130
you're dead!

611
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,990
But it's a cancer operation, after all.

612
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,400
Will it

613
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,210
be risky

614
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,130
for my father's health?

615
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,370
Any kind of operation can be risky.

616
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,280
During the operation,

617
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,170
there are all kinds of emergencies, too.

618
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,130
As a doctor, I can't

619
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,370
assure you anything.

620
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,140
But please rest assured.

621
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,540
I'll do my best.

622
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,450
Xiaowei,

623
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,740
- how's it going with the patient file?
- Oh, Dr. Gu.

624
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,140
Here's the operation consent
of the patient in Bed 9.

625
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,620
Thanks.

626
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,400
She hung up on me again.

627
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,610
She's even more heartless than me.

628
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,760
I haven't touched anything.

629
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,680
I was just too tired of standing.

630
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,640
I couldn't hold it
and then sat for a while.

631
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,840
If you're not okay with it,

632
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,440
disinfect your chair.

633
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,970
Forget it.

634
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,640
What brings you here?

635
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,290
Do you really think I wanted to come?

636
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,730
Your mother,

637
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,920
namely my dear aunt,

638
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,450
said you didn't go home for days

639
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,320
and no one could get you home.

640
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,420
I have to take you back home today,
no matter what.

641
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,680
In recent days,

642
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,800
I've indeed been busy.

643
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,280
But what meal can we have
at this time of day?

644
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,640
Dinner or midnight snack?

645
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,090
That's not my concern.

646
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,490
You know your mother's temper.

647
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,970
If you don't go home, she'll kill me.

648
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,640
Go, go, go.

649
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,680
Go back home quickly.

650
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,690
Go, go.

651
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,520
After you.

652
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,690
Fine.

653
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,740
Let me get changed first.

654
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,850
I have to follow you.

655
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,890
Honey, get to sleep early.

656
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,130
You'll have the operation tomorrow.

657
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,540
You can't eat anything
after 9:00 PM.

658
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,970
Got it.

659
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,570
His family shall come
to the nurse station with me.

660
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,740
I'll tell you some dos and don'ts

661
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,090
for tomorrow's operation.

662
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,670
Oh.

663
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,520
Mom, you go with her.

664
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,120
Okay.

665
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Lin Zhixiao,

666
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,770
go with your mother.

667
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,010
Don't miss anything.

668
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,730
Fine. Fine.

669
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,270
I'll go. I will.

670
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,140
Qiuqiu, have fun by yourself.
