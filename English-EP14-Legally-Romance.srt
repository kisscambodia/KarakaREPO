1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,480
I can still have

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,720
river snails rice noodles
in a western-style restaurant.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,320
So that you can have

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,590
your favorite classy style

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,840
and I can have my favorite flavor.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,640
I know nothing about chemistry.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,520
I know

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,760
this may smell bad,

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,440
but it

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,470
tastes really good.

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,870
Even just for my sake,

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,630
just take a bite.

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:25,920
OK?

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,200
I…

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,150
No, no, no.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,110
Shiyun, Shiyun, I'll do it myself.

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,630
I'll do it myself.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,310
No, no.

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,150
This is too gross.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,910
I can't do it.

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,840
A western-style restaurant

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
doesn't offer river snails rice noodles.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,760
Shiyun,

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,510
I miss the person you used to be.

25
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,310
I miss my old self too.

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,440
Miss Liu,

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,750
it's very uncool of you

28
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
not to share your food.

29
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,240
What are you doing here?

30
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,270
I went to have rice noodles
with my friend,

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,240
and the shop owner said you,

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,630
the new boss, had taken away

33
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,750
all the last portions of duck feet

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,470
in a doggie bag.

35
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,240
Without letting us know,

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,030
you invested in

37
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,080
that failing river snails
rice noodle shop.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,110
Of course I must

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,750
bring people to patronize your shop.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,520
Come on, come on.

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,830
Miss Liu, wish you a booming business

42
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,000
and keep the money rolling in.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,880
Congrats.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
How delicious this is!

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,520
It feels much better
to run a shop than dating.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,750
You can make money

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,440
and have the food for yourself.

48

What do you think?

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,030
I didn't have a breakup.

57
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,470
I'm just lucky to be single again.

Let's go.

Go to my shop.

Go.

- You've become a boss yourself.
- Here, guys.

Try some of this.

- You've even made me want to invest.
- Our store is newly opening.

Such a niche local specialty

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,950
is unfit for investment.

77
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,950
You need to be cautious. Do you know?

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Ignore him.

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,110
He's an ignoramus.

but also sets out

Party A's obligations to Party B.

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,200
This is no good.

145
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
I must change it.

146
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,270
Here you are.

147
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,320
OK.

there are

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,200
still many parts of it

before I sign it.

165
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,510
and go through it back at home,

166
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,760
then before the signing of the contract,

167
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,270
I can do anything

these are not off limits.

171
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,640
If you sign it,
I'll exploit you limitedly.

172
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,670
If you don't,

173
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll exploit you unlimitedly.

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,830
Choose one for yourself.

175
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,950
I'll sign.

176
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,040
I'll sign, OK?

177
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,670
I'll add one clause as well.

178
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,480
Now

179
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
you are on probation.

180

The period of probation

181
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,390
is decided by Party A.

182
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,830
So

183
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,070

Party B does anything

187
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,160
that displeases Party A

188
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,550
or anything that is inappropriate,

189
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,230
Party A can

190
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,350
cancel the contract straight away.

191
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,070
This is

192
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,200
an imparity clause indeed, OK?

193
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,110
All right.

194
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,830
Then you don't sign it

195
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,320
and I don't sign it.

196
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,270
I'll tear up the contract

197
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,670
and let's just break up,

198
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,510
scatter away

199
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,480
and end up as losers on both sides.

200
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,200
I'll sign, I'll sign.

201
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,260
It's quite tasty.

202
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,230
Let me get a pair of lovebirds

203
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,600
to draw the winning numbers for you.

204
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,950
(Booming Business)
Hooray!

205
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,790
What are you doing?

206
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,070
We must stay low-key now.

207
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,550
Stay low-key.

208
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,600
Your love flame

209
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
is so obvious.

210
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,320
What's the point of keeping it secret?

211
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,350
Just make it public.

212
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,320
Exactly.

213
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,000
But

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,440
being lucky in love
means being unlucky in a prize draw.

215
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,920
You guys are so lovey-dovey.

216
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,480
Be careful not to ruin your luck.

217
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,760
Cut it out!

218
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,720
- Wish me well.
- Here we go.

219
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
Time to draw the winning numbers.

220
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,790
Let's congratulate

Great!

231

on getting a lifelong

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,830
VVIP card.

235
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,670
Great!

236
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,390
We even missed this?

237
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,830
No, you didn't.

238
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,790
Congratulate Table No.4

239
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,760
on winning the special prize.

240
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,830
The special prize?

241
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,440
How much does it offer?

242
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
Money is nothing but dirt.

243
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,230
The special prize

244
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,280
is an exclusive performance

245
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,840
of a song by me, the boss.

246
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,910
The one and only in the world.

247
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,080
Just a moment.

248
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,440
I think the special prize

249
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,670
is not bad, is it?

250
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,710

the area I'm asked to be in charge of

301
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,910
is too big.

302
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,710
Qian Wei,

303
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,150
as a class leader,

304
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,520
you should show them a good example.

305
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,880
With greater ability

306
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,840
comes greater responsibility.

307
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,150

312

313
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,200
Turns out dating my boss

314
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,470

and keeps throwing away bottle caps?

322
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,230
Such kind of person deserves

323
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,080
to be single for a lifetime.

324
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,280
They deserve nobody's love.

354
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,030
I have a terrific idea.

355
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
I've decided

356
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,030
to be your lucky star from now on

357
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,280
and collect all the luck for you.

358
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,230
What do you think?

359
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Disgusting.

360
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,440
I want a reward.

361
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,710
OK.

362
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,200
Hold it.

363
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,110
Let me be your wishing well today.

364
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,000
Come on, make a wish.

365
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,280
Let me think of one.

366
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,520
Make me publicly known
as your boyfriend.

367
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
I can't do that.

368
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,910
When you make a wish,

369
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,640
you can't break the contract law.

370
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,590
It is written clearly

371
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,590
in black and white.

372
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,200
Now there's nothing I can do.

373
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,230
All right.

374
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,110
Alternatively,

375
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,080
don't call me younger brother again.

376
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,470
You must call me older brother instead.

377
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,230
What?

378
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,000
I only called you that way
for a few days

379
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
and you've grown impatient?

380
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,080
Call you older brother?

381
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,840
All right.

382
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
Well then, from now on,

383
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,080
instead of calling you younger brother,

384
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,670
I'll call you older brother.

385
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,790
Then you must call me boss.

386
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,200
And then

387
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,670
you must

388
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,440
serve me tea and water every day,

389
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,350
and massage my shoulders

390
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,960
and every night you must…

391
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,820
♪I hold you in my arms♪

392
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,570
♪You're the one

393
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,690

394
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,960

♪You're the one

397
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,190
♪Even stars can't be as shiny as you♪

398
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,310
♪In such a world♪

399
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,560
♪I love no one but you♪

400
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,860
♪I got crush on you bae♪

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,570
♪I can't hide all my feeling♪

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,400
♪You still need me How to prove♪

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,940

♪Keep all my promises for you♪

409
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,560
♪What's to be continued prediction♪

410
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,010
♪You're exactly the one
for the rest of my life♪

411
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
(It looks like)

412
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,200
(I can't come to see you again.)

413
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,640
(And my last episode of memory)

414
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,200
(is gone as well.)

415
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,110
(Zixin seems to be in a bad mood.)

416
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
(I sensed something wrong with her)

417
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,760
(at the seaside today.)

418
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,230
(I used to)

419
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,030
(draw in so many people)

420
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,280
(to set her up with Lu Xun.)

421
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,110
(They didn't end up together,)

422
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,200
(but Lu Xun and I)

423
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,440
(are secretly in love.)

424
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,030
(Will Zixin think)

425
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,150
(I'm making use of her
to hook up with a man?)

426
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,200
(How shall I explain this?)

427
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,520
(It's such a thrill)

428
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,470
(to date my bestie's boyfriend secretly)

429
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,350
(without her knowing it.)

430
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,470
How outrageous!

431
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,200
In northeastern China,

432
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
such a sleazeball

433
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,470
who steals her bestie's man

434
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,470
would have been cut to pieces!

435
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,030
Well,

436
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,320
anger is bad for your health.

437
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's switch to another channel

438
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,910
and skip this one.

439
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,960
(Yang Xuewu,)

440
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,400
(back then you hypocritically)

441
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,790
(deceived me into trusting you)

442
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,710
(and got to be with Fourth Master.)

443
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,760
(Since you once told me)

444
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,150
(you'd return Fourth Master to me,)

445
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,000
(this time)

446
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,030
(I'll just)

447
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,200
(keep him with me.)

448
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,640
Switch to another one.

449
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,150
Switch to another one.

450
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,590
(I'm at best)

451
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,520
(an ordinary intimate secretary.)

452
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,760
(When ordinary intimate secretaries like us)

453
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,320
(meet our bosses, we'd only say)

454
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,080
("Morning, boss".)

455
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,470
(But the No.1 intimate secretary)

456
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:01,960
(and the closest secretary)

457
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,150
(don't say it that way.)

458
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,280
("It's already morning, boss.")

459
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,430
Switch to another one.

460
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,000
Switch to another one.

461
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:06,520
Well,

462
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,470
there's something wrong with your URL.

463
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:07,800
Let me fix it.

464
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,110
Qian Wei,

465
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
let's talk.

466
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,900
(Mo Tao calling)

467
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,710
If something comes up,

468
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
you can just…

469
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,950
It's OK.

470
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
Some household trifles.

471
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,590
Qian Wei,

472
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,430
do you remember that place over there?

473
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,110
That's where

474
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,000
we were punished to run laps
when the semester began.

475
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,310
Of course I do.

476
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,430
Back then, you obviously

477
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,040
did nothing wrong,

478
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,350
but ended up being punished
to run laps with us.

479
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,000
In fact,

480
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
I had always obeyed the rules.

481
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,680
That was the first time I got punished.

482
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,520
It was quite special.

483
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,040
Actually, had we not been

484
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,830
punished to run two laps at that time,

485
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,880
I don't think

486
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,800
we'd be friends.

487
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,830
So I think

488
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,680
it was worth it.

489
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,760
Zixin,

490
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,640
there's something I haven't told you.

491
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,160
But I think

492
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,000
I'd better

493
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,560
make it clear to you.

494
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,350
I sincerely

495
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,040
wanted to help Lu Xun to court you.

496
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,880
Fortunately,

497
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
you didn't like him

498
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,560
and by some strange chance

499
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,040
we ended up together.

500
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,520
I actually like Lu Xun.

501
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,470
When I came to run laps at that time,

502
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,310
I did it 50%

503
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,110
because of him.

504
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,680
You… like him?

505
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,430
When did it begin?

506
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,110
A long time ago.

507
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,020
(Himalayan Crystal
The Power that Heals Everything)

508
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,950
All adverts are deceptive.

509
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,160
As to the marks of chickenpox,

510
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,070
as long as you don't scratch them

511
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,950
and care for your skin,

512
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,950
they won't become scars.

513
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,710
Don't scare yourself.

514
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,710
Darling,

515
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
Mr. Lu and his wife
are on business trips.

516
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,110
Lu Xun

517
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,830
has just got back
from his graduation trip.

518
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,520
For the next few days,

519
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
(Textbook Key Points)
he'll have meals with us.

520
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,460
(Textbook Key Points)

521
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,340
(Textbook Key Points)

522
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,640
This is for you.

523
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,460
(Textbook Key Points)

524
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,040
This was just a souvenir

525
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,040
from the guide of my sightseeing tour.

526
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,920
When I went to your home for dinner,

527
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,110
your mother said you liked it,

528
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,760
so I just brought it to you.

529
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,920
But I didn't expect it would

530
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,350
make you misunderstand.

531
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,400
Why did you

532
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,560
come here with me today?

533
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,710
There have been rumors

534
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,230
about you and me on campus.

535
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,230
I've always wanted to find a chance

536
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,280
to make it clear to you.

537
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,830
Changing QQ profile name

538
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
and applying for law school

539
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,310
were both coincidences.

540
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,160
They had nothing to do with you.

541
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,190
But I don't want you

542
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,520
and the girl I love

543
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,040
to get the wrong idea.

544
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,430
So deal with it as you see fit.

545
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,280
I'm sorry.

546
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,280
Zixin is back.

547
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, I heard

548
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,230
Lu Xun had put in a lot of effort

549
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,710
just to see Zixin today.

550
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,000
Lu Xun and I are just friends.

551
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,830
Don't get it wrong again.

552
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,640
I don't want to

553
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,950
make him embarrassed again.

554
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,710
Well,

555
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,000
what's the matter with

556
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,470
Lu Xun?

557
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,560
I always thought

558
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,400
you rejected his love confession

559
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,070
and I comforted him for quite some time.

560
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,190
But you just…

561
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,040
Did…did I get it wrong?

562
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,190
Not really.

563
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,430
It's just because I didn't want

564
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,950
people to know

565
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,230
my unrequited love didn't pay off,

566
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,470
so I never said anything about it.

567
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,590
Well, I…

568
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,190
I really didn't mean to do that.

569
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,640
It's not you to blame, Qian Wei.

570
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,190
Actually, I was

571
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,400
expecting Lu Xun

572
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
to change his mind one day

573
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,520
until

574
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,310
I saw him collecting bottle caps
for you.

575
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,760
At that moment,

576
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,680
I had already given up hope.

577
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
I've known him since childhood.

578
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,590
I know what he's like.

579
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,000
He doesn't like drinking beverages,

580
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,710
but he managed to collect

581
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,880
a full box of bottle caps for you.

582
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,190
That's probably

583
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,230
the difference between

584
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,190
attentive care and a lack of it.

585
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,350
Qian Wei, it's not you to blame.

586
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,350
But now

587
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,830
I still can't

588
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,190
give you guys my blessings.

589
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,800
I think I need some time

590
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,400
to process it

591
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,470
by myself.

592
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,040
Hope you can understand.

593
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,800
You bet I do.

594
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,760
Anyway,

595
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,110
I just want you to know

596
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,430
whatever happens,

597
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,190
I'm always your good friend

598
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,560
and I'll always be there for you.

599
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,640
Let's drop this subject.

600
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,880
What's more,

601
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,470
I saw from the library's

602
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,560
book borrowing record that

603
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,350
you like this comic strip.

604
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,110
They happened to

605
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,640
have replenished some books this time,

606
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,430
so I borrowed one for you.

607
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,110
Hope it can cheer you up.

608
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
Thank you, Qian Wei.

609
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,070
Well,

610
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,070
I'm going back first.

611
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,230
I'll let you spend some time alone.

612
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,070
(One can't live)

613
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,560
(without memories,)

614
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,310
(neither can one live)

615
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,280
(only with memories.)

616
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,070
(There's always a time
to wake up from a dream.)

617
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,800
(A dream that never breaks up)

618
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,190
(will turn into sadness one day.)

619
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,110
(After saying these words,)

620
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,880
(Xiaoman returned)

621
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,350
(the feathers
that didn't belong to her.)

622
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,350
(Should I)

623
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,310
(also put down)

624
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,110
(this crystal...)

625
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,540
(Make sure you do.)

(...and my obsessions with the past?)

627
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,560
Sir,

628
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,400
you can get a stuffed toy for free

629
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,800
if you spend 200 yuan
on the claw machine.

630
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,470
No, thanks.

631
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:58,950
Maybe this stuffed toy

632
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,350
doesn't belong to me.

633
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,040
And these,

634
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,920
please put them back as well.

635
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,070
Chongwen,

636
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,190
I can keep you company

637
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,160
if you are unhappy.

638
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,590
It's going to rain later.

639
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,560
I have an umbrella with me.

640
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,400
Let's go together.

641
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,880
No, thanks.

642
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,400
I don't like to hold an umbrella.

643
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,310
Have you heard about it?

644
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
A dude from
Economic Management Department

645
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,190
put up his project

646
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,070
on the College Students
Entrepreneurship website

647
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,590
to drum up investment,

648
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,920
but he fell victim to a scam

649
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,430
and lost all the start-up fund

650
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,110
he had saved.

651
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,040
Now he's borrowing money
from people here and there.

652
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
That's horrible.

653
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,760
Is this world short of fools nowadays

654
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,040
so that it's college students' turn?

655
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,430
You can say that.

656
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,190
Lu Xun, don't work too hard.

657
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,040
Go out for a breath of air.

658
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,070
Let's get a bottle of beverage

659
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,560
to refresh ourselves.

660
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,920
Just spare a moment.

661
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,350
Yes, yes.

662
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,160
Let's go, Lu Xun.

663
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,040
Go, go, go.

664
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,830
I'm a bit tired indeed.

665
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,950
Aren't they in the self-study room?

666
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,280
Where are they?

667
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,680
Is there only a laptop left?

668
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,760
Such being the case,

669
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,190
since you lied to me,

670
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,310
I'll just expose you

671
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,560
on Renren.com.

673
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,590
At the time I have money

674
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,280
and get enough ability

675
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,590
and energy,

676
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm going

677
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,880
to run

678
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,070
a non-profit legal aid platform.

679
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,400
With it, we not only handle cases,

680
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,310
but also popularize the law

681
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,350
more broadly.

682
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,520
I think that's a good idea.

(wants to fulfill her wish)

Are you moved?

693
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,800
Arrogant and weird.

694
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,880
Tell me,

695
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,070
when did you begin
to have a crush on me?

(Non-profit Legal Aid Platform)

697
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,350
Don't get me wrong.

698
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:48,830
I've just

699
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,400
stolen your creative idea.

700
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,160
Hang on.

701
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,560
You haven't told me

702
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,430
why you didn't tell me

703
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,830
you rejected Zixin.

704
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,070
You were always

705
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,710
keen to compete with me to be No.1.

706
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,400
I did it

707
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,950
to co-opt you to be on my side.

708
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,310
Don't you get it?

709
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,310
Nothing is too deceitful in a war.

710
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,280
If you are still angry,

711
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,280
I can help cool you down.

No.

713
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,190
Stop.

00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,640
You

716
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,950
show me

00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,230
I gave it to you but you didn't want it.

722
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,800
How can I give it to you so easily now?

723
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,430
Younger brother,

724
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:36,950
you should know

725
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,680
you are still on probation now,

726
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,400
so

727
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,640
I suggest that you

728
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,470
watch your language.

729
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,710
I gave it to you but you didn't want it.

730
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,920
Now to have it back,

731
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,830
there has to be a condition.

733
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,470
when the website goes online,

734
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:55,830
let's

735
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,950
do the 100 case sources

736
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,760
first.

737
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,830
And I've finished designing

738
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,590
the layout of the web page.

739
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,520

743
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,280
of the non-profit legal aid platform

744
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,680
is not very good at

745
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,520
using the internet,

746
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,560
so I'm thinking of

747
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,880
making them a…

748
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,430
Don't do this.

749
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,560
Just make an app

750

and that's it.

751
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,830
That's simple, easy to understand

and foolproof.

Much more convenient than this one.

754
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,800
It's still not bedtime

755
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,160
and you start dreaming again?

756
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,560
Smartphones are not yet ubiquitous,

757
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,760
how can we make an app?

758
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,520
I tell you what,

759
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,560
app is bound to be

760
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,400
a megatrend in the future.

761
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,760
As luck would have it,

762
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,800
we can seize this opportunity

763
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,000
to get in on the ground floor.

764
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,110
Are you serious?

765
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,000
I've been learning website making

766
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,560
for a long time.

767
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,880
Can you not

768
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
be whimsical

769
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
on the spur of the moment?

770
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,710
I'm not being whimsical

771
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,160
on the spur of the moment.

772
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,760
I wrote the planning proposal

773
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,950
for this project too.

774
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,560
Where is it?

775
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,920
No, it was last time.

776
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,800
I tell you what, Qian Wei,

777
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,160
this is

778
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,310
not realistic at all.

779
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,430
If we are

780
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,430
making a website now,

781
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,070
we can

782
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,400
do everything by ourselves.

783
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,590
But as to an app,

784
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,430
now there's

785
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,280
not a single mature

786
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,000
app project on the market.

787
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,950
Without a ready-made template,

788
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,590
are we gonna

789
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,830
write the data codes by ourselves?

790
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:10,950
What's more,

791
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,880
the server

792
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,280
which can protect privacy

793
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,230
has yet to be developed.

794
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,760
Are we gonna

795
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,640
develop the server by ourselves?

796
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,830
How to solve these problems?

797
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,520
I know.

798
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,400
Calm down for now.

799
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,310
Let's take our time.

800
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,040
These things

801
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,640
can actually

802
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,560
be solved step by step.

803
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,040
Think this way.

804
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,920
Let's first

805
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,310
put it up on the College Students

806
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,470
Entrepreneurship website,

807
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,110
and then

808
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,560
we'll look for investors

809
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,710
to get a start-up fund.

810
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,710
With the fund,

811
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,040
we'll…

812
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,110
There are many fraudsters online.

813
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,590
How can you

814
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,230
trust them so easily?

815
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,950
What's more…

816
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,110
I know your concern,

817
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,190
but it really doesn't matter.

818
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,880
It's very safe.

819
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,350
Our teachers have also recommended it.

820
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,800
What's more,

821
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,040
there's scrutiny at each level…

822
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,560
Excuse me,

823
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,310
can you not cut in

824
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,590
while I'm talking?

825
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,190
Impulsive idealist,

826
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,760
really,

827
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,350
you'll only bring trouble to yourself.

828
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,110
When we were at Zhanying Law Firm,

829
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,880
I talked about the legal aid platform

830
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,310
and you also said
I was being unrealistic

831
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,110
and idealistic.

832
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,640
Turns out no matter
which time and space we are in,

833
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,470
you are always so dictatorial

834
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,350
without ever considering

835
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,800
what I think and how I feel.

836
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,950
You just don't believe me,

837
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,470
do you?

838
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,110
It's not that I don't believe you.

839
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,800
This is unrealistic.

840
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,920
When I come up with an idea,

841
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,230
you don't even
think about its possibility

842
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,880
before you reject it and say no to me.

843
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,920
I'm your girlfriend,

844
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,950
not your employee.

845
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,000
We are equal.

846
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,160
I also have my own ideas.

847
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,830
And you?

848
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,350
You don't let me say a word.

849
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,880
You insist on being so stubborn,

850
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,160
don't you?

851
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,800
Fine.

852
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:44,800
Let's not

853
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,590
start a business together.

854
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,400
From now on, you make your website

855
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
and I'll drum up

856
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,160
investment for my app,

857
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,920
OK?

858
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
We are not fit to work together!

859
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,190
Qian Wei…

860
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,280
This

861
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,470
College Students Art Festival

862
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,760
is the focus of attention
of our university,

863
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,710
the provincial government

864
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,190
as well as our city's leaders.

865
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,800
(Jiang Taigong: I'm an insider,
this project's partners are at odds.)

866
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,310
(Be cautious of investment risks.)

867
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,430
So our school must
come up with a good program.

868
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,920
- A war of public opinions?
- As to this event,

869
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,430
- You don't see where I'm from.
if you have any good suggestions

870
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,920
or good ideas,

871
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,110
- You'll be dead meat.
- feel free to talk about them.

872
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,680
No volunteers?

873
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,230
Qian Wei,

874
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,350
you have a lot of ideas.

875
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,680
Tell us what you think, please.

876
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,800
Now we are talking about…

877
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,590
The art festival.

878
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,710
The feast.

879
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,520
Yes.

880
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,160
Don't just think about eating.

881
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,040
We'll soon be having

882
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,070
the month-long Haizhou City

883
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,430
College Students Art Festival.

884
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,000
This year,

885
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,640
it's our university's turn
to be the host.

886
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,590
The university's leaders

887
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,800
require each school

888
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,150
to come up with a program.

889
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,190
Other schools

890
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,080
are rehearsing their programs now,

891
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,870
but our school

892
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,760
hasn't even thought of one.

893
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,190
Here I'm

894
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,950
going to great lengths

895
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,840
to have a mobilization meeting,

896
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,560
but down there

897
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,630
you are zoning out uninhibitedly.

898
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,150
Had I not gritted my teeth and got on,

899
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,470
I'd fly into a temper.

900
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,230
Sorry, sir.

901
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,760
Liu Shiyun,

902
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,950
you are frolicking so happily.

903
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,280
Is it because you have any ideas?

904
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,230
Any ideas?

905
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,760
Do you really…
really want to hear my ideas?

906
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,950
Go ahead.

907
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,950
You wouldn't suggest a show of

908
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,320
arrows through a box with me in it.

909
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,870
I thought of a program

910
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,150
which adapts Journey to the West

911
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,760
into a musical

912
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,120
and

913
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,360
I'll compose and sing it.

914
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,190
Miss Liu,

915
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,840
are you thinking of a program

916
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
or murdering the audience?

917
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,230
Who can stand

918
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,390
your voice?

919
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,040
You insist on hearing my idea.

920
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,470
I was just kidding

921
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,470
to bring out better ideas.

922
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,860
(Art Festival Program Entry Form)
(Musical Liu Shiyun)

923
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,630
Look at mine.

924
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,230
My dream

925
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,800
was to transfer to Music Department

926
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,870
and perform in Mercedes-Benz Arena.

927
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,800
Are you serious?

928
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,430
Why?

929
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,080
What's wrong?

930
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,760
Can't I have a music dream

931
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,280
though I'm tone deaf?

932
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,870
Now that I'm reliving the past again,

933
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,950
I'll not only
turn the tables for myself,

934
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,190
but help my friend realize her dream.

935
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,100
(Help Liu Shiyun)

936
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,020
(Help Liu Shiyun
realize her music dream)

937
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,560
What are you talking about?

938
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,280
She was serious.

939
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,320
She was not kidding.

940
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,840
How do you know

941
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,000
without giving it a try?

942
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,910
It's OK.

943
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,390
What's more,

944
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,670
you see,

945
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,040
apart from this one,

946
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,600
do you have any other ideas?

947
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,000
How can we

948
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,950
not try it?

949
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,630
Anyway,

950
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,320
I place my bet on Liu, sir.

951
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,840
Usually, such kinds of

952
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,000
cross-department performance

953
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,080
actually scores extra points.

954
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,560
It gets good publicity

955
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,120
and is

956
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,080
very well received.

957
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,470
It can also win glory
for our university.

958
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,150
But most important of all,

959
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,910
it can score extra points
for the teacher.

960
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,710
Is that so?

961
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,120
Well,

962
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,190
Liu Shiyun,

963
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,520
show me

964
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,430
your application form

965
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,520
and the materials.

966
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,560
It's good that you have an idea.

967
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,150
Go, go.

968
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

969
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,190
We are at odds.

970
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,040
Why are you leaning in?

971
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
I'm leaning in to…

972
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,230
Well, let's do it this way.

973
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,360
Let's take a stand.

974
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,230
Those who are in favor of Liu,

975
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,470
let's stand up together,

976
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,120
OK?

977
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,150
Well, I…

978
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,630
I'm in favor of Liu.

979
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,950
Me too.

980
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,950
In favor of Liu!

981
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,520
In favor of Liu!

982
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,520
Me too.

983
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,190
Me too.

984
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,910
Me too.

985
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,520
Yes.

986
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,150
Me too.

987
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,760
Me too.

988
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

989
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

990
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,840
Yes.

991
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,000
Me too.

992
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:26,800
Yes.

993
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,760
Me too.

994
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,710
Go for it!

995
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,760
Go for it!

996
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,760
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

997
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,230
- OK, OK, OK.
- Go for it!

998
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,430
That's settled then.

999
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,430
Lu Xun, Qian Wei,

1000
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,120
you are in charge
of the overall planning.

1001
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,950
You guys
are on the list of merit students

1002
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,520
submitted this year.

1003
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,120
Arranging a good show

1004
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,190
helps you

1005
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,470
to get selected.

1006
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,560
Whether

1007
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,520
you apply for a job offer afterwards

1008
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,390
or an offer from a foreign university,

1009
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,840
it'll only do you good.

1010
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,390
Make sure you put effort into it,

1011
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,800
take it to heart

1012
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,150
and do a good job of rehearsal.

1013
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,840
Work hard.

1014
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,190
It seems we are rivals again.

1015
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,670
I don't want to be your rival.

1016
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,080
I want to.

1017
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,710
This time I must

1018
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,760
be a municipal merit student.

1019
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,280
The Golden Monkey
rises with his powerful cudgel.

1020
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,320
Each generation
exceeds the previous one.

1021
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,000
Sir.

1022
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,760
Sir,

1023
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,320
I'm a law school student.

1024
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,360
Could you let me know

1025
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,950
if the result of our program is out?

1026
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,190
300 Years of Mundane Bond, right?

1027
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,600
Yes, yes, yes.

1028
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,150
Well,

1029
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,360
as to this program,

1030
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,800
its plots

1031
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,120
are too complicated.

1032
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,280
Complicated?

1033
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,190
Not really.

1034
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,040
Let me give you an introduction

1035
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,800
and you won't feel

1036
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,670
it's complicated.

1037
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,190
Let… let them listen.

1038
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,150
- They are listening too.
- What...?

1039
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,470
They are listening too.

1040
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,430
…w-wise ideas do you have?

1041
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,080
It's like this.

1042
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,560
First of all, you see,

1043
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
(300 Years of Mundane Bond)
the name

1044
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,230
300 Years of Mundane Bond

1045
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:55,800
is a very good one.

1046
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,000
(Scorpion Spirit)
The storyline

1047
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,320
is actually about the scorpion spirit

1048
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,840
and Monk Tang.

1049
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,080
(The scorpion spirit used to be)

1050
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,560
(receiving Zen instruction
under Buddha's seat.)

1051
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,840
(Due to her admiration
of Golden Cicada,)

1052
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,390
(she was deliberately sent down
to the mundane world.)

1053
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,710
(The scorpion spirit
waited for Golden Cicada)

1054
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,760
(for 300 years
by the River of Quicksand,)

1055
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,560
(only to see him turn into Monk Tang)

1056
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,190
(who was the master of Monkey King)

1057
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,320
(and cross the River of Quicksand.)

1058
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,760
(By then, Monk Tang had forgotten)

1059
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,040
(the vow between them)

1060
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,470
(and set his heart on
seeking Buddhist scriptures.)

1061
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,540
(Men's Restroom)

1062
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,340
(Original Lyrics and Music)

1063
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,260
