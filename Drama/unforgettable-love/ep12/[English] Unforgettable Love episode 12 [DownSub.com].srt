Unforgettable Love
EP12

2
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,750
So in the second half of the year

3
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,000
you want to focus

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,039
all on the smart bracelet.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,630
Aunt,

6
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,670
This is the data

7
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,400
in two months since the smart bracelet on the line.

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
You could have a look.

9
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,750
I'm very optimistic

10
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,880
about its development prospect.

11
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,590
I'm going to repack it

12
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,880
as a key product,

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,039
for the European and American market.

14
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,360
Can you convince the board?

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,039
Of course.

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,479
Next week,

17
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,479
it's the thirtieth anniversary dinner.

18
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,360
I'll arrange it.

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,520
And you,

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
just concentrate on

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,270
preparing to deal with the board.

22
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,310
Okay.

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,270
In previous years, you always went alone,

24
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,360
What about this year?

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,400
The same.

26
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,590
This year I'll invite my wife with me

27
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,440
together.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,190
Are you sure she can?

29
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,670
I'm afraid

30
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,270
she even can't complete

31
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,190
a simple dance.

32
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,590
Just learn.

33
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,110
You can't look down on her.

34
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,710
By the way,

35
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,270
next week

36
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,440
is the 30th anniversary dinner of Heshi Group.

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,480
Come together with me.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,360
A dinner?

39
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,960
I won't go.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,590
Won't go?

41
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,790
Why is that?

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,670
Isn't a so-called dinner party

43
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,150
wearing a sky-high heels,

44
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,190
breathless tights,

45
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,440
smirking at people,

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,150
standing up all night cramping,

47
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,000
without even a sip of hot soup?

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
So boring.

49
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,270
You should recognize that

50
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,560
you are Mrs. He now.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,710
If you don't show up,

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,230
that will give rise to criticism.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,670
The key is that

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
my aunt will suspect our relationship.

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,080
You could tell her that

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,110
I'm sick.

57
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,480
If it doesn't work,

58
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,230
I'm going to the hospital and get a cast,

59
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,790
pretending to have a relapse.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,560
I get it.

61
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,040
You're afraid

62
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,560
you're not a good dancer, are you?

63
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,150
But yes,

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,630
for someone like you

65
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,000
who doesn't have a complete cerebellum

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
and can't control

67
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,400
their coordination well.

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,480
It's really hard

69
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,310
to make you dance.

70
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,360
You know that?

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,270
In my primary school,

72
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,840
I was the leader

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,710
of the radio gymnastics,

74
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,440
a center of the dance.

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,440
Waltz

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,040
and radio gymnastics

77
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,079
are two completely different concepts.

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,079
Isn't it just a waltz?

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,710
In the park where my mom dance,

80
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,230
All those aunts can do this.

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,480
I'll show you.

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,710
Look.

83
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,080
Chug chug

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
One two three

85
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,840
Chug chug

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,040
One two three

87
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,040
Just having a dance,

88
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
you can step on your feet.

89
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,480
If I get trampled then,

90
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,920
I'll deduct your salary.

91
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,230
So much trouble.

92
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,110
You're just stimulating me, aren't you?

93
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,880
I tell you

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,480
I

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
really can't stand the stimulation.

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,750
It's just dancing,

97
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll learn and show you.

98
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,000
Having our meal first.

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,480
Oh, my God.

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,710
Why did I say that？

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
This is Judy, your etiquette teacher,

102
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,080
Helen, body teacher,

103
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,040
Nana, Dance teacher.

104
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,880
And this one,

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,840
is your dress designer

106
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
Doris

107
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,190
and her assistant.

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,960
The dinner

109
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,040
is eight days away.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,310
Don't be lazy.

111
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,270
Every day when I get home,

112
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,670
I'll check on how you're doing.

113
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,310
Hello, Mrs. He.

114
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,630
Hello.

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm so tired.

116
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,190
I finally realize that

117
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,520
what is

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,310
devil training.

119
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,360
So you're tired?

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,710
Well done.

121
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,750
This is a dinner

122
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,190
that I specially prepared for you.

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,920
Xiaobao and I have finished it.

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,960
I was tortured for a day,

125
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,150
and you just give me this.

126
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
What's wrong with that?

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,840
I can't get used to it for a long time

128
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,360
what's your diet like before.

129
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,360
Just take this opportunity

130
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,520
to adjust your diet.

131
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,360
And

132
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,560
this dinner

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,920
is both nutritious and healthy,

134
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,960
which suits you very well.

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,750
So eat up.

136
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,110
There is not any meat in it.

137
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,630
Boss He, I really can't eat it without meat.

138
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,110
I'm very hungry now,

139
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,920
very sleepy, and very tired.

140
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,520
I need high calorie food

141
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
to comfort my broken heart.

142
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,480
So I want...

143
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,880
I want...

144
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
What would you like to eat?

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,840
Hot Pot.

146
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,310
Are you sure?

147
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,230
Which one is this?

148
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,670
Just take a look.

149
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,590
Relax.

150
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,190
Hold on.

151
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,630
So hurt.

152
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,710
So hurt.

153
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,880
And then push the leg down.

154
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,270
Yes, that's it.

155
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,790
Come down a little bit.

156
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Relax.

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,790
Come on.

158
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,080
So hurt.

159
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,790
Hold on.

160
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,400
Good.

161
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,520
Yes, that's it.

162
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,790
So hurt.

163
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,790
Keep your balance.

164
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,790
Tighten up.

165
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,710
Pose.

166
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,360
Keep your head straight.

167
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,230
Relax, OK.

168
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,400
Come down.

169
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,670
Abdomen in.

170
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,710
Lean against the stick.

171
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,790
Tighten up.

172
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,560
Good.

173
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,560
Straighten out.

174
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,880
I'll go to the bathroom.

175
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,750
Speaking.

176
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,880
Mr. He, we have news from Tongcheng City.

177
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,550
Did you find the person?

178
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,230
Yes.

179
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,920
I've ordered

180
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,960
the ticket to Tongcheng City for you,

181
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,110
taking off in two hours.

182
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,350
I'm on my way to meet you.

183
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,080
OK, I see.

184
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,150
Where is he going in such a hurry?

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,430
Ladies, take a break.

186
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,150
Okay.

187
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,270
Why so hurry?

188
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,600
Something off the ground.

189
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,680
Since he is not here,

190
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
why don't I give myself

191
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,960
a holiday?

192
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,150
Let's have a hot pot tonight.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,350
I get off work at six on time.

194
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,640
Didn't you say

195
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,800
you need to keep fit

196
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
for the dinner?

197
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,310
How dare you to eat hot pot?

198
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,350
Mrs. Liu.

199
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,470
I can't stand it.

200
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,880
Whatever the dinner.

201
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,310
I want the hot pot to keep energetic.

202
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,680
Isn't this the driver, Mr. Zhang?

203
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,720
Mr. Zhang?

204
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,230
Who is the driver?

205
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,800
The guy

206
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,350
who used to drive for He family.

207
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
He hasn't been seen since the car accident.

208
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,430
Mr. He has been looking for many years

209
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,510
and never found him.

210
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,680
Zhang Cheng, where are you?

211
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,310
Find the truth.

212
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,720
What's the truth?

213
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,040
I just found a Hot pot

214
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,430
near my company.

215
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,680
You could wait for me in the company

216
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
and I'll be off work in a minute.

217
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,550
Mrs. Liu, I'm going out.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,510
Okay.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
Ladies, thanks for your teaching today.

220
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
I have something to go out.

221
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,430
You could take a break.

222
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,600
Let's go on in the evening.

223
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,040
All right, Mrs. He.

224
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,640
Li Wei found Zhang Cheng

225
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,720
in a poker game.

226
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,960
Li Wei promised to help Zhang Cheng pay back the money.

227
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,720
So he agreed

228
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,040
to tell us what happened that year

229
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,110
and recorded it.

230
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,190
Please listen to this.

231
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
That night

232
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,800
did Mr. He's brother

233
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,960
told you to prepare the car?

234
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,390
Yes.

235
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,230
Do you remember the weather that day?

236
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,510
It rained heavily.

237
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,960
The road is slippery.

238
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
I drove as slowly as I could.

239
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,270
But because Mr. and Mrs.

240
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,310
were talking all the time.

241
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,760
I'm a little distracted.

242
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,840
What did they say?

243
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,190
I'm not sure.

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,000
It distracted you,

245
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,350
don't you remember?

246
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,430
Maybe they were arguing.

247
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,040
I forgot that.

248
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,430
It seems that the husband was in a hurry to go out

249
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,310
and the madam was a little slow.

250
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,640
The two

251
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,310
quarreled something.

252
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,310
I was distracted.

253
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,920
At that time,

254
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,350
There was a cart coming to us.

255
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,230
My sister-in-law is not that kind of person

256
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,390
to argue with my brother

257
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,470
just because he was out late.

258
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,470
If in the world,

259
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,960
there are people who never lose their temper.

260
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,680
My sister-in-law is that person.

261
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,150
My brother told me that

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,150
she was never in a hurry.

263
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,600
Let alone,

264
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
she got angry and quarreled with others.

265
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,760
So Zhang Cheng was lying.

266
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,350
It's Li Wei.

267
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,080
Speaking.

268
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,150
I'll fly there later.

269
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,680
Mr. He, there's something wrong.

270
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,040
Zhang Cheng ran away.

271
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,600
You've been looking for him for four years.

272
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,390
Less than four hours,

273
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,550
you let him run away.

274
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,110
It was my negligence.

275
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,550
I'm sorry about that, Mr. He.

276
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,840
Then keep looking for him.

277
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,960
Go.

278
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,390
Beef, mutton,

279
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,390
pig's feet, chitterlings, brains,

280
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,760
chicken paw, chicken claw,

281
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,080
duck feet, duck gizzards, beef balls,

282
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,600
and sausage, spam

283
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,110
Weige, where are you?

284
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,390
I have taken the elevator up.

285
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,190
As long as it's about hot pot,

286
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,190
you are very punctual.

287
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,270
No kidding.

288
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,040
Life is boring.

289
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Regret nothing in matters of

290
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,840
milky tea and hot pot.

291
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,920
That's ok.

292
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,720
Could you wait for me

293
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
at the elevator.

294
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,960
I'll find you when I drop off a file.

295
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,550
Ok.

296
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,350
Come in, come in, come in.

297
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,270
Mr. Wen.

298
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,040
This is the document from Chairman Wen.

299
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,550
Put it here.

300
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Miss Yang.

301
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,270
Anything else?

302
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,110
You know what?

303
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,230
What?

304
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,470
You are so beautiful.

305
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,510
Say something I don't know.

306
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,920
Your lipstick

307
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,390
looks delicious.

308
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,840
Can I taste it?

309
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,270
My lipstick is expensive

310
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,800
and you don't deserve it.

311
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,040
Don't you have a ripple

312
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,110
in your heart?

313
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,080
I have.

314
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,270
My heart is connected to my stomach,

315
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,430
and I'm going to throw up.

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,080
Mr. Wen, that's your move?

317
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,550
Of course not.

318
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm just trying to liven up the atmosphere.

319
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,600
And I found that

320
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,510
there are serious problems

321
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,510
with the documents you sent.

322
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,390
Take it back and rearrange it.

323
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,510
Excuse me, Mr. Wen

324
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,350
What's wrong with these documents?

325
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,190
The problem is so obvious.

326
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,720
Do you need me to say more?

327
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,040
Fine.

328
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,350
I'll go back and sort it out.

329
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Isn't that right?

330
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,310
I see other girls

331
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,640
all like this.

332
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,310
Did I copy the wrong part?

333
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,190
Oh, my God, It must be a wrong path.

334
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,080
If he saw me,

335
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,880
he bound to grab me back to practice.

336
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,600
Ruowei, where are you?

337
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Did you get there?

338
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,550
In a minute.

339
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,000
Just give me a minute.

340
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,510
This is not a good place to stay.

341
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,150
Or I could wait for you in the store.

342
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,640
No. The store was in a secluded location.

343
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,080
You can't find it.

344
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,800
You just wait a more moment.

345
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,840
I'll be there in a minute.

346
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,230
Go,go,go.

347
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,430
That's OK.

348
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,680
I got thirty-six strategies.

349
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,720
There's always one for you.

350
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,960
Could you be polite?

351
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,230
Don't you know to knock first?

352
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,150
It's a familiar taste.

353
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,040
Needless to say.

354
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
It must be about Zhang Cheng again.

355
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,150
Am I so obvious?

356
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,079
Every time it's about Zhang Cheng.

357
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,000
You're going to

358
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,920
radiate

359
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,680
the smell of danger.

360
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,510
The people I sent out

361
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,109
found Zhang Cheng.

362
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,470
You finally found him.

363
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,720
It's a good thing.

364
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,470
Where is he?

365
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,840
Run away again.

366
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,470
again?

367
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,720
This driver

368
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,960
doesn't look so simple.

369
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,270
Under your persistent search,

370
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,600
he's been hiding from you for four years.

371
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,880
You're right.

372
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,270
He is just a driver.

373
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,310
How did he do it?

374
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,190
It's not normal.

375
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,390
These years

376
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,310
I'm also increasingly aware that

377
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,760
what happened in those days

378
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,640
maybe not simple at all.

379
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,350
There must be someone behind him.

380
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,470
I have to find the truth.

381
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,350
I can't let my brother and sister-in-law

382
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,000
just died for nothing.

383
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,510
Don't worry.

384
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,760
If you need

385
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,150
You can call me at any time.

386
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,760
Why doesn't Ruowei answer the phone?

387
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,680
In such a big company

388
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,110
why can't I find the toilet?

389
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,880
So suffocating.

390
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,640
Qin Yiyue

391
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,800
I...

392
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm here

393
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,470
to the bathroom.

394
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,920
Calm down, please.

395
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,350
Nothing to explain to me?

396
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,960
No.

397
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,310
Yes.

398
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,000
Then explain it.

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
Why not practice dancing

400
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,040
at home at this time?

401
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,920
Yeah.

402
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,880
This time,

403
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,470
shouldn't I be

404
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,800
practicing dancing at home?

405
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,510
Why didn't I

406
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,760
practice dancing at home?

407
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,270
It's actually like this.

408
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,310
I don't understand what the teacher taught me.

409
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm here for Ruowei.

410
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,230
Ruowei knows how to dance

411
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,510
and I asked Ruowei to teach me.

412
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,310
Ruowei knows.

413
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,840
Mr. Wen

414
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,110
Your information has been sorted out.

415
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,110
Whether you are satisfied or not,

416
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,350
it's time for me to leave work.

417
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,600
If you want to change it again,

418
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,110
Please be early tomorrow.

419
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,470
Yue'er

420
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,270
Didn't I tell you to

421
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,550
wait for me at the elevator?

422
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,350
Let's go. I'm off work.

423
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,640
Hot pot and milky tea is calling us.

424
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Mr. He

425
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,550
You'd better

426
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
make allowances for Yue'er.

427
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,270
You see.

428
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,720
Yue'er is forced by you

429
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,600
to be pale.

430
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,110
I don't think you need to

431
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,000
get off work in a hurry.

432
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,880
Go and rearrange the information.

433
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,640
Let's go.

434
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,760
Go, go, go.

435
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,190
Turn around.

436
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,110
Do you know that

437
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,640
all those days of hard work

438
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
after a hot pot

439
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,600
all in vain.

440
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,270
Don't be so serious.

441
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,310
Each night,

442
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,840
I could practice two hours more.

443
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,920
Three hours.

444
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
Three hours?

445
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,190
Your foundation is poor.

446
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,430
Three hours is not enough.

447
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,390
Giving you two more months.

448
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,000
If you dislike me like this

449
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,800
then I won't go.

450
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,510
I don't want to go anyway.

451
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,600
I've always felt that

452
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,960
your attitude towards work

453
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
at least is serious.

454
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
I'm serious about my work.

455
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,390
But you want me to dance

456
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,510
with a beautiful dress

457
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,350
in front of a bunch of strangers.

458
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,640
What kind of work is this?

459
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,800
And in our contract,

460
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,470
there is no such work.

461
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,550
I'm only in charge of Xiaobao.

462
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,840
What's more,

463
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
It's your private business.

464
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,680
I can't control it, isn't it?

465
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,150
Private business?

466
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,350
You're right.

467
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,840
I really shouldn't waste your time

468
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,550
with my private business.

469
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,550
So baffling

470
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,840
you are.

471
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,150
So stingy.

472
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,270
Fierce, isn't it?

473
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,390
So can I.

474
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,800
Qin Yiyue

475
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,150
Why aren't you

476
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,350
practicing at home at this time?

477
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,680
I don't know why.

478
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,080
Are you leaving now?

479
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,270
You scared me.

480
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,110
That's Qiaoyan's temper.

481
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,640
He is used to being strict with himself

482
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,600
and often harsh on others.

483
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,350
And today

484
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,550
because of Zhang Cheng

485
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,800
he was in

486
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,920
a bit of a bad mood.

487
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,550
Zhang Cheng

488
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,110
You mean the driver?

489
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

490
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,350
How much do you know

491
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,310
the car accident five years ago?

492
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,960
I just knew a tittle.

493
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,270
There was a heavy rainstorm on Xiaobao's birthday.

494
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,960
He Qiaoyan's brother and sister-in-law

495
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,640
drove out.

496
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,110
Suddenly there was an accident.

497
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,310
They died on the spot.

498
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,000
Only Xiaobao survived.

499
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,110
I knew all that.

500
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,760
Then where was the He Qiaoyan?

501
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,430
You don't know that?

502
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,600
I can't believe he didn't tell you.

503
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,310
I'm not very clear about the details.

504
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,550
I remember my aunt said that

505
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,880
at that time

506
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,150
He Qiaoyan received a phone call

507
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,880
and not sure what happened.

508
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,230
He went to the hospital.

509
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
He had an accident

510
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,800
on his way to the hospital.

511
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,310
He was in a coma for half a month .

512
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,350
It was his aunt

513
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,840
who contacted the police and dealt with the matter.

514
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,680
He didn't know until he was discharged.

515
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,000
In that accident,

516
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,000
His brother and sister-in-law, who had been closer to him than his parents,

517
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,680
had died.

518
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,110
And at that time

519
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,840
the driver, Zhang Cheng, who was driving for them

520
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,880
was gone.

521
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,840
Heshi Group at that time,

522
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,350
despite the tight capital chain,

523
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,390
continue to maintain the expansion.

524
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,270
The leader of He family died.

525
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,880
The youngest son who just woke up from a car accident

526
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,800
have to inherit the family business.

527
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,960
Everyone is waiting to see

528
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,150
if He Qiaoyan can turn the tide.

529
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,150
But more people think

530
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,550
the Heshi Group will be over.

531
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,960
Heshi Group was painstaking efforts from his father

532
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,350
and his brother.

533
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,840
He had to suppress his grief.

534
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,350
Under internal and external troubles,

535
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,000
he had to carry everything alone.

536
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,880
In the end, Heshi Group

537
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,510
was brought out the bankruptcy crisis.

538
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,680
How did He Qiaoyan

539
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,430
hold out in those days?

540
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,040
Let's see. What is it?

541
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Two chicken claws.

542
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,960
Alright, alright. You are not stupid.

543
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,920
Sister, why don't you eat?

544
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,000
Didn't we have a deal?

545
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,880
We'll eat with you till you come out holding the wall.

546
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,920
I don't think you're going to

547
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,840
skip the hot pot,

548
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,190
just because He Qiaoyan is angry.

549
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,550
It's your favorite hot pot.

550
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,040
Thinking of him

551
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,230
carrying all this alone

552
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,350
made me

553
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,880
feel a little sick in my chest.

554
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,640
I want to do something for him.

555
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,270
Therefore

556
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,190
I want to protect him.

557
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,800
Sister

558
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,040
You are in danger.

559
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,190
It's dangerous.

560
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,390
I'm not dangerous.

561
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,760
My high heels are protected.

562
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,550
No problem.

563
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,230
No, no, no, I'm not talking about that.

564
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,600
I mean

565
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,960
It doesn't matter

566
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,640
for a woman

567
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,800
to have a crush

568
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,920
on a man.

569
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,920
But once you're tempted,

570
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,040
you're screwed.

571
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,150
Then you can't stop it.

572
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,150
What did you say?

573
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:19,880
I'm just

574
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,800
being too empathetic.

575
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Isn't that right, Xiao’an?

576
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,270
Here you go again.

577
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,040
Xiao'an, come to have some vegetables.

578
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,080
Sister.

579
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,270
I know

580
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,840
your life is not easy these days.

581
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,840
I decided to support you.

582
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,470
I decided to

583
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,800
go to Ning Fang's psychological studio

584
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
as a volunteer.

585
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,390
You don't work in the hospital anymore?

586
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,470
No, you can't go.

587
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,640
I just use my break time

588
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,760
for public welfare.

589
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,470
Sister, aren't you moved?

590
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
I would like to follow you forever.

591
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,110
I'm moved.

592
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,190
Then

593
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,640
If you with me

594
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,960
share this dish together

595
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,350
I will feel more moved.

596
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,880
Xiao'an

597
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,040
Eat, eat, eat.

598
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,390
You invite

599
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,000
so many teachers for her.

600
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,880
But she ran away by herself.

601
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,270
Forget it.

602
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,550
I didn't expect

603
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,230
she can do it anyway.

604
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,550
I'll arrange a companion for you.

605
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,800
No, aunt.

606
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,150
After all, in the past five years

607
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,960
every year

608
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,040
I've been going to dinner alone.

609
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,920
I'm used to it, too.

610
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,960
I told you that you two weren't compatible.

611
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,230
I chose her.

612
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,510
I think we fit in.

613
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
Please believe her,

614
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,000
as well as my choice.

615
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,840
I'm afraid you'll be held back by her.

616
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,270
In recent years,

617
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,960
You are in charge of the Heshi Group

618
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,470
and has made great progress.

619
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,350
But those shareholders

620
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,000
want more than that.

621
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,470
They want you to do better.

622
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,760
Take the company to the next level.

623
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,470
So you have to behave

624
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,680
perfectly.

625
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,040
Give them confidence.

626
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,960
Have you eaten yet?

627
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,390
Bye, aunt.

628
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,720
Be safe on the way.

629
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,880
I know what you're going to say.

630
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,230
I know I'm wrong.

631
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,960
I will make a review

632
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,800
with practical actions.

633
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,430
Come with me.

634
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Come on, come on, come on.

635
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,390
I said it.

636
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,310
I will make a review

637
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,040
with practical actions.

638
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,190
You don't have to say anything.

639
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,880
It's too heavy. Give me a favor, please.

640
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,470
Don't worry.

641
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,080
I'll never hold you back.

642
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,230
You could take all these snacks away.

643
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,720
You could set your mind

644
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,040
to prepare your board.

645
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
I'll take the dinner.

646
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,230
The board is yours.

647
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,720
The couple who are of the same mind could do anything.

648
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,190
I have already dismissed those teachers.

649
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,390
I have already reviewed.

650
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,000
Why don't you take it easy.

651
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,880
I'm not angry.

652
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
You're right.

653
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,960
I shouldn't have forced you.

654
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,150
My own business,

655
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,350
I can do it myself.

656
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,350
And

657
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,800
What the aunt said

658
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,840
you don't worry about it.

659
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,110
It's not that serious.

660
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,720
Have an early rest!

661
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,110
I have work to do.

662
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,000
He is angry clearly.

663
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,510
A penny pincher

664
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
We all know that

665
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,550
this dance must be elegant.

666
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm very elegant.

667
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,040
Is that so?

668
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,960
How does it still feel wrong?

669
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,510
One two three

670
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,470
How does it feel wrong?

671
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,640
Did you get it?

672
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,640
What?

673
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I said you don't have to force yourself.

674
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,270
I said that, too.

675
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
We are married.

676
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,550
Other than that turn,

677
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,390
What else?

678
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,390
Nothing.

679
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,310
Well, I guess I'm going to start

680
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,190
at the beginning.

681
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,600
Waltz

682
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,390
is an adagio in four to three beats

683
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,350
at twenty-eight

684
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,470
to thirty bars per minute.

685
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,080
Each stanza has three actions.

686
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,510
Every beat is a step.

687
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,550
The first shot

688
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,470
Dongdada, dongdada

689
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,110
Put your left arm around me.

690
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,720
Back your left leg first.

691
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,550
Back your right leg.

692
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,110
Are you ready?

693
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,190
One two three

694
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,600
Two two three

695
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,430
Three two three

696
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,760
Slow down, your legs are long.

697
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,390
You know your legs are short.

698
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,680
Keep up with me.

699
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,840
What's wrong?

700
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,920
It's hard to be a fairy.

701
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,040
Other fairies wearing high heels

702
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,680
like stepping on colorful clouds.

703
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,550
And I?

704
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,510
Just like stepping on the hot wheels and burn your feet.

705
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,080
Sit down and have a rest.

706
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,920
Come here.

707
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,190
Give me a moment. I'll get some medicine.

708
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,840
Okay.

709
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,510
Go on.

710
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,880
Go.

711
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,080
One two three

712
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,270
One two three

713
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,310
One two three

714
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,880
Two two

715
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,920
Play along with the music.

716
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,190
Do you like this style?

717
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,800
What's up?

718
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,719
can't I?

719
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,000
Take it easy.

720
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,150
Come here.

721
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,350
Excuse me.

722
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,310
I forgot to change my shoes.

723
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,760
Are you ready?

724
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,190
Of course.

725
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,190
In order to fit this skirt,

726
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,600
I haven't eaten all day.

727
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,080
Is there a buffet here?

728
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,510
I specially told the kitchen

729
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,310
to add more.

730
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,150
Enough for you.

731
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,800
You mean

732
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,920
you dislike my huge appetite.

733
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm afraid you'll bite when you're hungry.

734
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,680
Let's go.

735
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,960
Are you nervous?

736
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,110
No, not at all.

737
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,600
Because you and Xiaobao are here.

738
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,550
Let's go.

739
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,310
Xiaobao, go to see your uncle, Wen Gu.

740
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,600
Go.

741
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,040
Yiyue

742
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,840
I'll take you to say hello to aunt.

743
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,550
Aunt.

744
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,190
Aunt.

745
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,680
Every gentlemen of the board

746
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,000
This is my wife, Qin Yiyue.

747
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,110
This is Mr. Wang.

748
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,000
This is Mrs. Wang.

749
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,080
This is Mr. Liu.

750
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,000
And Mr. Xu,

751
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,720
Are you ready, Mrs. He.

752
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,270
Yiyue

753
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,390
Thank you.

754
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,270
For what?

755
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,190
For being with me.

756
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,960
Are you sure?

757
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,110
Has Miss Lin's invitation arrived yet?

758
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,470
I took it to the Lin's personally.

759
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,600
So sweet.

760
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,430
Are you ready?

761
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,840
What else is on？

762
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Go, Xiaobao.

763
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,230
The special melody your love.

764
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,840
You sneaked through my playlist.

765
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,040
I can also adapt to your preferences.

766
