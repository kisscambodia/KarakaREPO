HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,634
Who is it?

3
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,969
Why did you leave without seeing me?

4
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,971
Where are you? Let me buy you dinner.

5
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:25,267
I won't mention becoming a priest.
Have dinner with me.

6
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,769
<i>I didn't come here to see you.</i>

7
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,479
<i>I'm leaving now. Get back to work.</i>

8
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:29,981
Mom!

9
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,526
I'm having dinner with Jong-su.

10
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,152
Bye.

11
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,530
He is on a business trip. What--

12
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,246
Mom. Mom!

13
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,637
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,267
If you're free, you should hide
in the on-call room now.

15
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:08,936
It's all right.
Thanks for looking out for me.

16
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:12,231
Shouldn't you be off now?

17
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,233
You're kind of a workaholic.

18
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:16,694
I'm not working. I'm waiting
for Song-hwa to have dinner together.

19
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,946
She's talking to someone,
so I'm waiting for her now.

20
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,532
You're worried about something, right?

21
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,993
Tell me. I'll help you out.

22
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,539
Tell me.

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,666
Professor Lee.

24
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,672
-It's nothing.
-What is it?

25
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,971
-It's nothing.
-Gosh, I want to figure out what it is.

26
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,432
I'm sure it has to do with Jeong-won.

27
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,143
Should I bring him here alive?

28
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:51,270
No, don't do that. He'll get hurt.

29
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:53,355
My gosh.

30
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:59,904
Gyeo-ul, I'm just curious, okay?

31
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:02,114
Since

32
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:05,159
when did you like Jeong-won?

33
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,497
I'm just curious.

34
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:12,750
Isn't that obvious?

35
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:19,298
I heard you're transferring
to the Sokcho branch.

36
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:22,968
I told him about it just this morning.

37
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:25,096
Gosh, words travel fast here.

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,431
I'll transfer to the branch too.

39
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:30,184
You can't.

40
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:34,063
Come on, be reasonable.
Why would you work there?

41
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,316
Because you are going there.

42
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,152
Get a grip, Chi-hong.

43
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,238
There are no residents over there.

44
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,907
If you transfer, you'll have to do
everything on your own.

45
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,951
It's not worth giving up
your position here.

46
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:50,704
Besides, if you transfer
before you become the chief,

47
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:52,873
it might backfire
during your interview later.

48
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:54,708
It's not a good decision for your career.

49
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:57,628
Chi-hong.

50
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:00,422
Who would transfer
in their fourth year of residency?

51
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:03,217
Instead, assist with more surgeries
and meet more patients.

52
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,637
That's what you need the most
and that will become your assets.

53
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:11,892
The last year of your residency
will be the most important period for you.

54
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:15,104
Just hang in there for one more year
and get the board.

55
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,523
Okay?

56
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:19,483
I will make decisions

57
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:22,653
for my life.

58
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,373
Kim Sang-man is in the OR now.
I'll get going now.

59
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:49,897
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

60
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,825
<i>I was just about to call you.</i>

61
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:13,579
-What are you doing?
<i>-I just got home.</i>

62
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:16,373
<i>-What about you?</i>
-I'm about to get off work.

63
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,793
<i>You're getting off work
really early today.</i>

64
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,128
<i>What's your plan after work?</i>

65
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:24,048
I'll head over to you now.
Don't go to sleep yet.

66
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,258
<i>-Now?</i>
-Yes. See you soon.

67
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:38,020
Do you want to eat or starve?

68
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,442
Did something happen again?

69
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,280
Really?

70
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,410
Gosh, life is

71
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:55,704
so shitty.

72
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:59,708
I can't believe your father.
Now you can't even talk shit about him.

73
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:17,017
I LEAVE ALL OF MY ASSETS
TO MY SON, YANG SEOK-HYEONG

74
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:20,896
When was this will written?

75
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,147
It was probably this spring.

76
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,068
It was the day when Ms. Kim Tae-yeon
told him about her pregnancy.

77
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:27,987
He drafted it that night.

78
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:30,864
That crazy bastard.

79
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,576
Did he leave anything to Ms. Kim?

80
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,289
None, to my knowledge.

81
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:45,337
The chairman considered Ms. Kim
nothing more than his caregiver

82
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:47,881
who will look after him until he dies.

83
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,592
That's what I have gathered
based on my knowledge.

84
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:53,053
What a jerk.

85
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:55,639
He impregnated her with a child.

86
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,851
That's a load of crap.

87
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,812
That selfish jerk.

88
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,982
He only cared about himself all his life,
that worthless leech.

89
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,248
Is there anything else in the will?

90
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,125
Like his last words
to your mother and you?

91
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,502
There is.

92
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:29,006
He wants me to run the company.

93
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,803
He wrote that I should quit my job
and run the company.

94
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:39,683
He's surely interested in my life.

95
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:45,981
So

96
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:47,775
will you quit your job?

97
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:58,494
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

98
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,628
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello.

99
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,214
-What's the line for?
-To consult.

100
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,674
I need to consult Professor Chae
about something.

101
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:13,884
Mine is about my career.

102
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,637
She's busy and sick.

103
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:21,934
Hello.

104
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:24,436
Dr. Yong, what did you talk about?

105
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,816
About dating.

106
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:31,693
-She talks about dating, too?
-Yes.

107
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,320
She can do it all.

108
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,031
She's better than
a professional consultant.

109
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:42,871
I miss those days...

110
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,623
Let's eat.

111
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:45,833
-Sir!
-Sir!

112
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,793
-Be quiet.
-I have a lecture in 20 minutes.

113
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:50,421
Get lost, Ik-jun. Dr. Do?

114
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,133
Beautiful Chae Song-hwa!

115
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,844
I only have eyes for you!

116
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,138
Hello, Professor Chae.

117
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,429
MEN'S CHANGING ROOM

118
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,434
This is Ahn Jeong-won speaking.

119
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:47,519
<i>Hello, this is Bae Jun-hui
from Emergency Medicine.</i>

120
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,437
Hello.

121
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,106
<i>I have a seven-year-old girl
with blunt trauma to the abdomen.</i>

122
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:53,358
She is mentally alert
and her BP is fine for now.

123
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,194
But her heart rate is high.

124
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:59,406
I did an echocardiogram with FAST,
and she has grade-four liver laceration.

125
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,326
I saw symptoms of hemoperitoneum,
so I took an abdomen CT.

126
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,785
And there's active bleeding.

127
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:05,746
Okay. I'm on my way now.

128
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:09,917
Dr. Jang.

129
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,169
Yes? Yes, Professor Ahn.

130
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,838
There's a seven-year-old girl
with blunt trauma in the ER.

131
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:17,299
Her vitals aren't good,
so we need to operate now.

132
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,093
Call Anesthesiology
and get me an OR as soon as possible.

133
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:21,845
<i>And order transfusion for the patent.</i>

134
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,888
Okay.

135
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,731
Hello, this is Jang Gyeo-ul from GS.

136
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,863
You're helping Seok-hyeong
with his paper? Why?

137
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:44,326
Why do you think? He asked me for help.

138
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,370
-Seok-hyeong asked you?
-Yes.

139
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,290
Why is he here?

140
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,543
Hello, Professor Yang. Sit right here.

141
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,296
Which department
do you not hang around, Ik-jun?

142
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,339
I go everywhere.

143
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:58,840
-Seok-hyeong. Teddy Bear.
-What?

144
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:01,385
Did you ask Dr. Chu to help you
with your paper?

145
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:06,515
Residents are busy. Don't bother them.

146
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:09,560
I did?

147
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,065
We don't have soup. Who wants cup noodles?

148
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:21,280
You two should finish this.
I have outpatients.

149
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,047
-Eat up.
-Okay.

150
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,808
Please come this way.

151
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,480
I did run the test.

152
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,734
Her liver is severely lacerated,

153
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:02,863
and a blood vessel is still bleeding
in her abdominal cavity.

154
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,282
We must undergo laparotomy now.

155
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,037
We will try to find
the damaged blood vessel

156
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,539
and stop the bleeding by ligating it
or performing hemostasis.

157
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:15,334
We may have to cut the parts

158
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,003
that are too damaged
for us to stop the bleeding.

159
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:19,379
How long is the surgery?

160
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:21,048
It will take at least two hours.

161
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:23,925
If the surgery gets difficult,
it may take up to four hours.

162
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,262
But I'll have to start the surgery
to check more in detail.

163
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,264
I'll do my best.

164
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:30,849
What?

165
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,643
Why not? We're married.

166
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,103
Well, that's...

167
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:38,106
We really had a wedding,
and we have wedding photos, too.

168
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,108
There are a lot of witnesses.

169
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:43,737
Doctor, he's been suffering
from ascites lately.

170
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,782
And a while ago, he coughed up blood,
so he had an endoscopy.

171
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,077
Doctor, he needs to be treated urgently.

172
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,080
I understand your point,
but even if you're a couple,

173
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,459
your marriage must be registered--

174
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,670
We'll do it. We'll register it today.

175
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,047
Even if so,

176
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,716
the regulation set by KONOS states
that you must be married

177
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,677
for a year for the living-donor
liver transplant to be approved.

178
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:10,430
To prevent any organ trade,

179
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:13,308
getting approved as a donor
is quite complicated.

180
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:20,690
I'm okay. I'm not going
to die anytime soon. Okay?

181
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,234
You're not going to die.

182
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:24,986
Don't say stuff like that.
Your mother is here, too.

183
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,740
I would recommend
getting a transplant right now,

184
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,951
but if you have to wait for the donor,

185
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,411
let's get treated first.

186
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:33,870
Why don't we

187
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:37,999
proceed with the living-donor
liver transplant after a year?

188
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,043
We'll monitor you as well.

189
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:46,133
When was your wedding?

190
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,427
Four months ago.

191
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:52,431
Had we registered our marriage then,

192
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,601
there would have been
only eight months left to wait.

193
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:59,271
If you don't mind,

194
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:01,940
can I ask why you didn't register
your marriage?

195
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,359
I told them not to do it.

196
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,279
When they were dating,

197
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:10,991
my son was diagnosed with cirrhosis.

198
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:14,536
Both families were against their marriage,

199
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,581
but they went ahead and got married.

200
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:24,212
It was me who stopped them
from registering their marriage.

201
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:29,092
She's a precious daughter to her parents.

202
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,304
If something happens to my son,

203
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:37,767
what about her?

204
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,274
Doctor.

205
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:47,944
What do I need to do
while we wait for a year?

206
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:53,617
I will exercise diligently
and stay healthy.

207
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:58,413
If I need to take medicine,
I'll make sure I take it.

208
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:02,375
I will come back after a year,

209
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,337
meet you again in this very office,

210
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:08,089
and get the approval for the surgery.

211
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,801
Doctor, please.

212
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,056
Please save my husband.

213
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:17,808
Please?

214
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,410
Here's a quiz for you.

215
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,206
I think

216
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,543
they met for the first time
while traveling.

217
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,797
Or...

218
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:50,924
was it a blind date?

219
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,851
I want the husband to get the liver
from a brain-dead patient.

220
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:04,688
What are the criteria for him to receive
a donation from a brain-dead patient?

221
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:09,651
You don't know?

222
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:12,195
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,989
Goodness, this is an elementary quiz.

224
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,157
-Study about that until tomorrow.
-Okay.

225
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:17,659
Next patient.

226
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,340
By the way, how did she get hurt?

227
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:35,302
She was on a scooter
and tripped over a speed bump.

228
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,513
And the handle hit her stomach
pretty hard.

229
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:39,764
My gosh.

230
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:43,810
I bet her parents are heartbroken.
How sad must they be?

231
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,274
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:55,363
Dr. Jang, your parents
must be very heartbroken too

233
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,490
if they knew
you don't even have time to eat at work.

234
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:00,368
Dr. Jang, I'll buy you
something delicious later.

235
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,203
No.

236
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,998
Professor Ahn,
treat her to a delicious meal.

237
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:08,168
I've been seeing
her around the most lately.

238
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,462
No, it's okay.

239
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,005
Mixter, please.

240
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:16,468
Suture, please.

241
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:23,308
If the surgery goes well
and the patient recovers,

242
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,726
I'll take you out for a nice meal.

243
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:27,604
Thank you.

244
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,607
When you tie, loosen your shoulder.

245
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,026
Don't pull too hard.
The blood vessel here is weak.

246
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,152
Okay.

247
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:36,529
Metzenbaum scissors, please.

248
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:39,824
Professor Min is sensitive
during his rounds.

249
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,326
Check the lab results thoroughly,

250
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,912
and make sure the first-year residents
check them, too.

251
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:45,914
When preparing for conferences,

252
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:48,583
make sure you don't leave out
any materials.

253
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,711
Familiarize yourself with the presentation
to lead the conference.

254
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:53,964
Chi-hong, did you find a place?

255
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,508
Not yet.

256
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,552
And you should move as soon as possible.

257
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,764
You'll be busier once you become a chief.

258
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,808
You should at least sleep well
in your own place.

259
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:09,062
I like the on-call room.
Moving is a bigger hassle.

260
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:10,383
Seok-min.

261
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,737
Moving is a bigger hassle.

262
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:16,219
Seok-min, you've been out here a lot
instead of studying for the board.

263
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,263
-Hello.
-Hi.

264
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,641
I'm not done handing over my tasks to him.

265
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:25,895
Besides, Dr. Do didn't even start
studying for the board.

266
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:31,776
What is it, Professor Chae?
Do you not like seeing me here?

267
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:33,778
Should I not come back?

268
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,655
I doubt you'll stop coming
even if I ask you.

269
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:41,244
-Chi-hong, Yun-bok.
-Yes?

270
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,829
Let's go. I'll take you out to dinner.

271
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,540
-What about me?
-And me?

272
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:47,334
You two should eat together.

273
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,044
Please, no.

274
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:52,630
I heard the faculty cafeteria is serving
short rib soup for the first time,

275
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:55,467
and it's packed.
There's only one table left.

276
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:59,346
Just think. Should I not take Chi-hong,
the future chief?

277
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,140
Or should I leave Yun-bok,
the future NS resident, behind?

278
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,353
Seon-bin and I should butt out.

279
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:08,730
Exactly. We'll get going.

280
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:11,733
-Let's go.
-Okay.

281
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,985
Bye.

282
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,404
-Bye.
-Bye.

283
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:17,572
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,244
How many moves can she see ahead?

285
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,789
Did she even have time
to think about all of that?

286
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,585
I told her.

287
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:33,505
Told her what?

288
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:39,135
That I like you.

289
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:45,975
And that I wanted to tell you how I feel,

290
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:49,979
but I didn't have the courage.

291
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:55,860
She took them with her for me.

292
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,785
Well,

293
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,329
this is

294
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,707
awkward,

295
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,964
so let's have dinner separately.

296
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:42,073
As expected, one of her blood vessels
in her liver was partially torn,

297
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,867
so that's why there was bleeding.

298
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,119
And the surrounding tissues
were severely damaged,

299
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:47,787
so it was hard to stop the bleeding.

300
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:50,206
I had to cut out a piece of liver
during surgery.

301
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,959
I've checked after the surgery,

302
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:56,004
and there were no more sources
of bleeding in her stomach

303
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:58,840
But there may be bleeding
from another organ.

304
00:19:58,923 --> 00:20:01,468
So we must keep an eye on her
for a day or two in the ICU.

305
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:03,970
You cut out a piece of her liver.
Can it grow again?

306
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,723
It's not life-threatening, right?

307
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,558
She's out of the woods for now.

308
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,604
I had to cut out a piece of her liver,
but it will grow back over a few months.

309
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,233
I did everything I could.

310
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:21,196
Now, we must wait and see how fast
she can recover from this.

311
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:27,410
You can see her once she goes to the ICU.

312
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,496
Thank you, Doctor.

313
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:30,663
Thank you.

314
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:33,166
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

315
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:59,817
We won't wake her up.
We'll induce sleep for a day or two,

316
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:02,111
and she'll have the ventilator
to help her breathe.

317
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:04,155
We can wake her up now,

318
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,907
but if we do, she'll be in more pain.

319
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,118
And if she moves around,
it won't be good for her.

320
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:12,997
So it's not that she didn't wake up
from the surgery,

321
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,291
but you put her to sleep
on purpose, right?

322
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,670
That's right, Mother.
He explained that to us earlier.

323
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,506
Right. She might move around
because her stomach hurts.

324
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:24,342
Instead of putting her through the pain
because she can't breathe well,

325
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:27,512
it's better to let her sleep for a day
to help her stabilize.

326
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:29,180
Mom!

327
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:32,100
My goodness, why are you here?

328
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,102
Doctor, this is Ji-hyeon's aunt.

329
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:35,144
Hello.

330
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,396
And this is her uncle.

331
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:37,564
Hello.

332
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,318
Doctor, I heard
Ji-hyeon is still unconscious.

333
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:45,363
If she's still unconscious,
isn't that a serious problem?

334
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:48,575
Well, I can wake her up now.

335
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:50,910
But if I do that,
she'll be in bigger pain--

336
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,121
Doctor, I'll explain it to her.

337
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:57,875
All right. Bye.

338
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,043
Thank you.

339
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:00,295
Doctor.

340
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:04,382
Nothing will happen to Ji-hyeon
throughout the night, right?

341
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,303
Please take good care of her.

342
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:11,514
I will. Nurses will be here.

343
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,642
And I'll be at the hospital tonight.
So don't worry.

344
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:17,103
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

345
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,858
NOVEMBER 30, 2019

346
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:05,151
ELAPSED TIME

347
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,307
You're still here?

348
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:37,558
I'm about to go home now.

349
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:38,893
Are you staying here all night?

350
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:42,647
Yes. I operated on a patient
with liver laceration this afternoon.

351
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,775
Sedation seems weak,

352
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:48,403
so I might have to adjust
the ventilator over the night.

353
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:51,030
Jeong-won, I'm sure
your patient will be okay.

354
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:53,908
She'd better.

355
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:59,247
-Song-hwa.
-Yes?

356
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,916
I only burdened you when you're sick.

357
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,668
I only thought about myself.

358
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,754
I mean, the Daddy-Long-Legs Program.

359
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:09,006
Don't mind me.

360
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,175
You should just focus
on getting better in Sokcho.

361
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,427
I'll take care of it.

362
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,178
Hey! No!

363
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,055
Don't do that. I want to run it.

364
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:19,475
I can take care of that in Sokcho.

365
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:22,019
The thought of being on that project

366
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:23,813
made me all excited.

367
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,398
I'll be doing it. Okay?

368
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:27,316
Don't take it away from me.

369
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,903
Fine.

370
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:34,073
Drive safely if you're driving.
Take a cab if you can.

371
00:24:34,157 --> 00:24:34,991
Bye.

372
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:54,385
Aren't you going home?

373
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:57,388
No. U-ju went to Changwon.
So I'm on a break.

374
00:24:57,472 --> 00:24:58,639
I'm going to enjoy this time.

375
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:00,266
Hey, do we have band practice this week?

376
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:03,603
No. Jeong-won will be at the hospital
this weekend.

377
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,273
Isn't your symposium next week?

378
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:08,232
Yes.

379
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:11,068
We'll have to stop for a while.

380
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:12,904
Okay. Goodnight.

381
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:19,660
I think Dr. Chu

382
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:21,746
likes you.

383
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,293
Can't you feel it?

384
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,920
You're so slow-witted.

385
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,842
Dr. Chu confessed her feelings?

386
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:36,969
Good for you.

387
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:40,348
I told her very respectfully
that I'm not interested.

388
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,852
Well, it's been a while
since she told me about her feelings.

389
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:47,438
Min-ha told me that she was okay

390
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:49,607
and she just wanted me to know
how she felt.

391
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,733
But how can I just ignore that?

392
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:53,319
We're working together at the hospital.

393
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:55,446
I hate feeling awkward or uncomfortable
while working,

394
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:58,449
so I met her outside the hospital
and talked to her.

395
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:02,411
I told her to meet a good guy
instead of liking me.

396
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,707
I told her that
I don't have time or energy

397
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,668
to date anyone right now.

398
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,797
I'm divorced.

399
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,382
And my life is complicated right now.

400
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:18,594
So instead of dating me,
I told her to date someone better.

401
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,518
So we're working together professionally
just like before.

402
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:29,730
It's true.

403
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:31,983
We're

404
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:34,819
kind of hip, you know.

405
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,239
-We're cool.
-Here's another interpretation.

406
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:41,409
If you weren't divorced
and weren't in a complicated situation,

407
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:43,619
you would have dated Dr. Chu.

408
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:49,500
No. I mean it.

409
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:55,006
I'm really not interested
in dating anyone right now.

410
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:58,134
And I'll probably stay this way.

411
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,846
And obviously,
I'm not interested in Dr. Chu, either.

412
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:06,767
I like being alone.

413
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:08,853
My life is perfect now.

414
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:10,855
I have U-ju.

415
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:15,526
You know? Jeong-won
has his siblings and God.

416
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,611
Jun-wan has a girlfriend.

417
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:19,572
And Song-hwa has
her brothers even if they fight a lot.

418
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:20,698
But who do you have?

419
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:26,662
I know that you have us.

420
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,498
But if you have your family
or loved ones with you,

421
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,126
their mere existence can comfort you.

422
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:35,671
Don't rob yourself of those chances.

423
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,590
I don't want her to get hurt.

424
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,011
She might get hurt

425
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:45,222
because of me and my situation.

426
00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:49,894
After seeing how hard it was for Sin-hye,

427
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,897
I promised myself not to forge
any relationships in the future.

428
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,864
Don't look at me like that. What is it?

429
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,158
Do I look pathetic?

430
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,411
No. I'm just craving alcohol.

431
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:09,080
Darn it.

432
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:13,292
Do you want to get some drinks?
It's Saturday tomorrow.

433
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:16,212
What? Wait, I won't get called in, right?

434
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,006
No, you won't. No one will call you.
It's past 2 a.m. now.

435
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,549
-It's past 2 a.m.
-My gosh.

436
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:23,594
You have an on-call doctor.

437
00:28:23,678 --> 00:28:24,679
Let's go.

438
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:26,764
You're still up?

439
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:29,517
It's past 2 a.m.

440
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,643
You should get some sleep.

441
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:32,561
<i>I didn't go to work today.</i>

442
00:28:32,853 --> 00:28:34,230
<i>I slept a lot in the afternoon.</i>

443
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:36,816
<i>But did you just finish your surgery?</i>

444
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:39,819
Yes. I'm just about to leave the hospital.

445
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:44,407
I'm hungry and sleepy.

446
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,575
And I miss you, too.

447
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:48,953
<i>Don't drive.</i>

448
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,831
<i>You can't even open your eyes
because you're exhausted.</i>

449
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:53,624
I was actually going to take a cab.

450
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:57,003
I was just about to call a cab.

451
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,507
Ik-sun.

452
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:04,552
I'm seeing things.

453
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:06,137
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

454
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,430
I see you.

455
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,473
<i>What? Don't say that.</i>

456
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:11,142
I'm serious.

457
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,853
A woman in front of me
is talking on her phone.

458
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:15,855
She looks just like you.

459
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:18,315
<i>That woman is talking on the phone, too?</i>

460
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,360
Yes. And she's crossing the street.

461
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,071
What?

462
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:26,490
What?

463
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:28,576
She's coming here.

464
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:41,130
Hello. I'm your hallucination.

465
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:33,307
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

466
00:30:36,352 --> 00:30:38,145
Are you okay? Are you feeling well?

467
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:42,733
Ji-hyeon, hang in there a bit longer.

468
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:47,071
Once you get all better,
why don't we all go

469
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,740
to an amusement park?

470
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:51,659
We took her off the ventilator.

471
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:53,577
Luckily, there were no lung complications.

472
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:56,914
We can keep an eye on her
without getting her intubated.

473
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:59,333
And her blood result seems good.

474
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,210
We just need to be a bit more patient.

475
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,298
Ji-hyeon, let's start drinking
water today. Okay?

476
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,592
-Okay.
-Good.

477
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,847
The nurse will help her drink water
little by little.

478
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,224
So don't worry too much.

479
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:19,103
Then, let's keep her in the ICU
for one more night and check her progress.

480
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:20,938
Thank you, Doctor.

481
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:22,148
Thank you.

482
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:32,950
Ji-hyeon, are you in any pain?

483
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:34,368
No.

484
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,036
Good girl.

485
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,748
Ji-hyeon, what do you want to eat
the most when you get discharged?

486
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:43,335
-Chocolate.
-You want to eat chocolate?

487
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,922
When you get discharged,
I'll buy you lots of chocolates.

488
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,383
Promise.

489
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:53,888
Three years ago, I removed
the tumor completely during surgery.

490
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,891
But unfortunately, the tumor relapsed.

491
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:02,021
But he's not in pain like before.

492
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,024
And all of his follow-up checkups said
he was fine.

493
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,403
Astrocytomas are a type of tumor
that's likely to come back after surgery.

494
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,780
It's very unfortunate.

495
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:14,200
Well, you will need

496
00:32:14,283 --> 00:32:17,203
additional surgery, radiation therapy,
and chemotherapy.

497
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:19,413
If you want to get the surgery,

498
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:22,249
I can find out when you can get admitted.

499
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,795
Or you can have some time for yourself
before making a decision.

500
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,216
I'll think about it.

501
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,800
What's there to think about?

502
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,970
When can he get the surgery?

503
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:35,930
Please

504
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:38,182
let me think about it first.

505
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,437
Doctor, can I make another appointment
and come back?

506
00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:44,939
Sure.

507
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:46,523
Okay.

508
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,318
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

509
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:58,619
He had a hard time
when he was undergoing radiation therapy.

510
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,206
He always came with his son and daughter

511
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,458
and they stayed by his side
and held his hand.

512
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:06,043
At his last appointment,

513
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:07,920
he was happy to hear that
he could come only once a year.

514
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:11,131
He knows how difficult it will be
because he's done it before.

515
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:13,300
He must go through the same process again.

516
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:15,177
I can understand
how devastated he must feel.

517
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,847
But I think he can overcome this.

518
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,646
Excuse me.

519
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:29,191
From what I know,

520
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:32,319
the patient is diagnosed with astrocytoma.

521
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:34,905
Then, three years ago
when he got the surgery,

522
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:37,658
what was his exact pathology?

523
00:33:39,493 --> 00:33:42,121
Well, it was WHO grade-two

524
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:44,248
diffuse astrocytoma.

525
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:48,168
This tumor is known to relapse
and develop into a higher grade.

526
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:50,004
I see. Thank you.

527
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:56,969
<i>"Estoy loco por el."</i>

528
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:59,179
<i>SPANISH BASICS, EASY SIGN LANGUAGE,
FLYING A DRONE</i>

529
00:33:59,263 --> 00:34:02,599
<i>"Estoy loco por el."</i>

530
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,059
When are you leaving?

531
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,853
Me? Three days from today.

532
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:10,149
What are those books?

533
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:12,568
I'm going to read them on the plane.
I have 14 hours to kill.

534
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:17,156
You're not going to the airport tomorrow?
Ik-sun is leaving.

535
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,783
Did I tell you that she was leaving?

536
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:23,162
She flies in the afternoon,
but I have an operation in the morning.

537
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:25,164
I'll go if I have time.
If not, I can't go.

538
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:28,625
My parents will be there.
She doesn't need her brother there.

539
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:30,586
-Hey.
-What?

540
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,838
Do you want to get drinks tonight?

541
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:34,715
I have something to tell you.

542
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:37,343
I'm busy today.

543
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,970
I have surgery later.
It will take a while.

544
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:42,264
Let's meet after your surgery
even if it's late.

545
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:46,393
What is it?

546
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:47,978
<i>It's a 35-year-old male.</i>

547
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:50,022
<i>He underwent surgery two times
to put a stent in due to CoA.</i>

548
00:34:50,105 --> 00:34:51,690
<i>The last one was three months ago.</i>

549
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:53,776
<i>He went to Jeongmyeong Hospital
due to a high fever.</i>

550
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,028
<i>Based on the test,
it seems like his stent was infected.</i>

551
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,822
<i>They asked if they could send him
to our hospital for his surgery.</i>

552
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,532
How are his vitals?

553
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:03,077
<i>His BP is 90 over 60.
His heart rate is 120.</i>

554
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,953
<i>And he's already intubated.</i>

555
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:06,997
Tell them to send him.

556
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,502
He has a hemothorax.

557
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:13,629
I think his aorta is ruptured, too.

558
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,048
This is bad. I must operate on him now.

559
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,217
Get a circulation chamber and an OR.

560
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,843
-Okay.
-What about his family?

561
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:20,886
They are on their way.

562
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:28,519
Who's the patient?

563
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,438
He had surgery two times
to put a stent in, and it got infected.

564
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:32,981
I'll remove the infected stent

565
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,691
and do a replacement.

566
00:35:34,775 --> 00:35:36,193
I'm not sure if it will work.

567
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:39,613
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

568
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:41,907
Does it feel as if something
is coming out of your nose?

569
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,784
-No.
-I'm glad to hear that.

570
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:45,494
Is his BP good?

571
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,454
Yes. And his urine volume
is back to normal.

572
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,249
At the earliest,
you can get discharged tomorrow.

573
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,000
Or two days from today at the latest.

574
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,502
Thank you.

575
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:56,296
I'll go to the Sokcho branch
for my appointment now.

576
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:58,215
I heard you're transferring there.

577
00:35:58,298 --> 00:35:59,967
How did you know?

578
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,301
It's top-secret.

579
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:04,263
My gosh. All the patients here know.
Everyone heard about it.

580
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:07,015
Excuse me, Doctor.

581
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,227
I have surgery tomorrow.

582
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,187
I heard I have a test this afternoon,

583
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,022
but I didn't get an explanation about it.

584
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:16,733
I see. Who's handling his case?

585
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:19,236
He's Professor Min's patient,
and Dr. Heo is his doctor.

586
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:21,738
I'll relay the message to your doctor.

587
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:26,535
I heard that you had a tough morning
because of the cerebral angiography.

588
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,872
You'll have a Navigation MRI
later at 8 p.m.

589
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,250
Through this MRI process,
we will see the location

590
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,294
and size of the tumor before surgery.

591
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:38,046
The resident in charge of your case
will come later

592
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,716
and explain to you in detail
while getting your consent.

593
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,301
I see. Thank you.

594
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:46,722
Dr. Heo is assisting
Professor Min's surgery now.

595
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,599
She was probably going to
explain it to him afterward.

596
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,476
I got it. I won't think she's slacking.

597
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,311
-Bye.
-Bye.

598
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,908
Suction. I can't see anything.

599
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,160
His BP is 50.

600
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:09,995
He's bleeding a lot here.
Hang up more blood.

601
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:16,502
ELAPSED TIME

602
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:18,504
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

603
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:23,634
FASTING

604
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:25,844
-Hello.
-Hi, Professor Lee.

605
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:27,804
What brings you here? You must be busy.

606
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:29,973
-Hello.
-Please don't get up.

607
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,227
You have an embolization tomorrow, right?

608
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,812
Hello. What time is the procedure?

609
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:38,190
-It's at 2 p.m.
-Then, you must fast for a long time.

610
00:37:38,273 --> 00:37:41,193
Let me know if it's too hard on you.
I'll see if we can move it up.

611
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:43,028
No, Professor Lee.

612
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:46,448
It's okay. I don't have much
of an appetite these days.

613
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:51,078
I have surgery tomorrow morning,
but it won't take long.

614
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:53,705
So if I have time after the surgery,
I'll stop by.

615
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,415
Let me explain the procedure.

616
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:57,876
When you can't get surgery
due to liver failure,

617
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,504
you get this procedure as a treatment
instead of surgery.

618
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:03,799
We can't expect your condition
to be cured with this,

619
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,300
but until you get a donor,

620
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:08,220
let's get you the procedure
and be more patient.

621
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:10,347
Don't worry and get a good night's sleep.

622
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,182
Thank you.

623
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:27,155
Gosh, I'm sure we'll drink up
all the Coke in Korea.

624
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,782
Gosh.

625
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:33,579
Leave them. I'll help you sort them out.
You have a bad neck.

626
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:36,915
There's not much to sort out.
I'll just take a few books I need.

627
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,543
Come.

628
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:42,462
My gosh, I can't believe
we're eating dinner at this hour.

629
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:44,673
Goodness.

630
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,760
Is Jun-wan working all night?

631
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:52,723
Probably. He'll end late at night.

632
00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:00,564
ELAPSED TIME

633
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,034
I'm not sure if this will work.
It's severely infected.

634
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:13,410
Forceps.

635
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,375
What about Jeong-won?

636
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,463
He's in the PICU.
He lives there, you know.

637
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,090
But you put away risotto for him, right?

638
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:29,217
-Yes.
-Okay.

639
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:30,927
I did.

640
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,823
Her hemoglobin count didn't go down.

641
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,159
And she's not bleeding right now.
She's fine.

642
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:56,912
We can move her
to a general ward tomorrow.

643
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,122
-What a relief.
-Gosh.

644
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,542
-That's great news.
-Once we move her down,

645
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:05,420
she'll take a CT scan on the seventh day
after the surgery.

646
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,297
And we'll observe
for one or two more days.

647
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:10,342
And if everything checks out,
Ji-hyeon can go home.

648
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:14,054
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

649
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:15,514
-Thank you.
-That's great.

650
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:16,682
Bye.

651
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,226
Doctor.

652
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,770
When do you sleep?

653
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:27,609
I've been here for four days.

654
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:31,321
You're here every morning and every night.

655
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:34,658
Thank you, Doctor.

656
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:35,909
Thanks to you,

657
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:38,745
Ji-hyeon lived.

658
00:40:40,914 --> 00:40:43,750
No, I'm grateful that Ji-hyeon recovered.

659
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,127
Bye.

660
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:50,090
He's a great doctor.

661
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:52,342
-That's great.
-Yes.

662
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:09,776
I bet your patient got better.

663
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:12,279
Yes.

664
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:19,369
How can you guys tell so easily?

665
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:20,912
What?

666
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:24,499
How do you guys know
whether my patient is doing well or not?

667
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,251
How could we not know that?

668
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:27,961
How do you guys know that?

669
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,175
I took a guess. We just take guesses.

670
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,802
You guys are amazing.

671
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:39,347
When did you order this risotto?

672
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:41,391
Did you just order this? At this hour?

673
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:43,101
It's nice and warm.

674
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:45,979
I thought you probably skipped dinner.
So I put one aside for you.

675
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:47,230
I microwaved it at the store.

676
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,903
When are you moving to Sokcho?
Are you going to take everything?

677
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:54,613
Thursday. No, not everything.

678
00:41:54,696 --> 00:41:57,574
I'm just going to take some books
and a few things I might need.

679
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:00,702
Does the apartment overlook an ocean?

680
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:04,998
Can I visit you often?
My gosh, that's my dream.

681
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:06,875
Sure. You'll probably like it.

682
00:42:08,585 --> 00:42:11,713
Ik-jun is leaving on Thursday, too.

683
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,423
Isn't he leaving for his symposium?

684
00:42:13,507 --> 00:42:14,716
Yes.

685
00:42:18,178 --> 00:42:19,054
By the way,

686
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:21,181
Jeong-won.

687
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:24,184
Yes? What is it?

688
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,104
Nothing.

689
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:38,490
ELAPSED TIME

690
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,202
I've been pressing for an hour,
but it keeps bleeding.

691
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:45,163
Surgery won't cut it anymore.

692
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:48,667
I have no choice.
Let's pack it up with gauze and stop.

693
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,835
Gauze, please.

694
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,117
I removed the infected stent

695
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,077
and switched it with an artificial artery.

696
00:43:24,661 --> 00:43:27,414
But the bleeding is too severe,
so we blocked it with gauze.

697
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:31,585
We tried our best to stop
the bleeding in the OR,

698
00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:34,671
but the blood wouldn't coagulate,
so he lost a lot of blood.

699
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:38,550
We're inducing antihemorrhagic agents
in the ICU now,

700
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,136
but we may not be able to stop
the bleeding.

701
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:44,848
Let's observe for the time being.

702
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,436
Monitor him while giving him RBC and FFP.

703
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:51,354
And call me right away
if he keeps bleeding.

704
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:52,272
Okay.

705
00:43:58,862 --> 00:44:00,906
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

706
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:08,121
Thank you.

707
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:12,792
Ms. Choi Ji-eun.

708
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:14,878
-Ms. Choi Ji-eun.
-Yes.

709
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:16,421
-Come on in.
-Okay.

710
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,885
I waited so long for my appointment.

711
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:24,262
It's been more than an hour.

712
00:44:24,346 --> 00:44:27,307
I'm sorry. There were a lot of
expecting mothers today.

713
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,060
I have to wait so long
every time I come here.

714
00:44:30,894 --> 00:44:32,270
I'll see you next week.

715
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:34,356
Hello.

716
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:39,444
-It's been a month.
-Yes. Hello.

717
00:44:40,403 --> 00:44:43,740
Doctor, I have never seen
this many patients in my life.

718
00:44:43,823 --> 00:44:47,452
I had to wait really long
for my appointment. I always have to wait.

719
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:51,122
I'm sorry. I see outpatients
only three days a week.

720
00:44:51,998 --> 00:44:55,460
I took a look at the test you took
for gestational diabetes.

721
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:58,380
By the way, we have
about the same number of patients.

722
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:01,132
But compared to last week,
we have fewer outpatients today.

723
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:02,467
Dr. Chu.

724
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,763
Can you get me the ultrasound scan
she took last time?

725
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:08,139
Sure.

726
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,271
What is it? What happened?

727
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:18,316
We were preparing for a DDLT, but
the recipient arrested during hepatectomy.

728
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,902
So cardiothoracic surgeons
are putting the patient on ECMO.

729
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,279
Professor Kwon Sun-jeong said
the transplant is impossible

730
00:45:23,363 --> 00:45:25,031
so he wanted me to call the KONOS.

731
00:45:25,615 --> 00:45:27,283
You must find a recipient quickly.

732
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:29,202
Did the organ arrive at our hospital?

733
00:45:29,285 --> 00:45:30,662
Yes.

734
00:45:30,745 --> 00:45:33,540
This is Ham Deok-ju,
the transplant coordinator at Yulje.

735
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:35,166
The recipient had a heart attack.

736
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,252
So the professor said
the transplant can't happen.

737
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,546
You must select another recipient.

738
00:45:40,588 --> 00:45:41,965
Okay.

739
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:44,592
Okay. Call me right away.

740
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,848
They will call the first patient
on the list and call us back.

741
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:54,978
But I'm not sure if this will work.
We lost a lot of time already.

742
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:57,063
How long has it been
since you extracted it?

743
00:45:57,272 --> 00:45:58,898
It's been over eight hours.

744
00:46:05,947 --> 00:46:08,491
Jae-hak, his parents are outside, right?

745
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:10,535
Yes.

746
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:13,079
I must update them.

747
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:25,341
We've been giving him
antihemorrhagic agents in the ICU,

748
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,510
hoping that it would coagulate his blood.

749
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:30,472
After observing for five hours,

750
00:46:32,182 --> 00:46:33,975
he's still bleeding.

751
00:46:37,604 --> 00:46:40,815
Even if we go back to the OR now,

752
00:46:41,483 --> 00:46:44,402
there's not much we can do
except for changing the gauze we packed.

753
00:46:45,278 --> 00:46:47,197
I don't see any other way.

754
00:46:51,493 --> 00:46:52,452
I am sorry.

755
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:08,760
Doctor.

756
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:14,057
Can I go see my son just once?

757
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,436
I want to see him

758
00:47:19,229 --> 00:47:20,688
one last time.

759
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:23,775
Please let me do that.

760
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,536
<i>It's a 48-year-old female patient
with SAH.</i>

761
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,204
<i>She's in a coma,
and her pupils are dilated.</i>

762
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,122
<i>She can't breathe on her own.
No motor function.</i>

763
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:57,851
She's in a coma.
There's no point operating on her.

764
00:47:58,393 --> 00:48:00,520
Induce her with dopamine
if her BP goes down.

765
00:48:01,771 --> 00:48:02,897
Okay.

766
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:06,317
Okay.

767
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:10,321
The first patient on their list
is far away from Seoul,

768
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:12,198
so it's impossible
due to the time restriction.

769
00:48:12,282 --> 00:48:14,951
And the doctor
of the next patient in line gave up.

770
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:17,203
The ischemia time was prolonged.

771
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:19,706
It will take too long
to find another recipient.

772
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:22,584
They want us to find a patient
in our hospital and call them back.

773
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,127
Then, they'll approve it.

774
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:28,464
Hello, this is the transplant coordinator
from Yulje Medical Center.

775
00:48:28,548 --> 00:48:29,632
Is this Ms. Um Ji-seon?

776
00:48:29,716 --> 00:48:31,718
YANG SEOK-HYEONG

777
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:33,303
Ms. Jang Seul-gi.

778
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:36,431
-Is Ms. Jang Seul-gi here?
-Right here.

779
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:39,392
You're next.
Please wait in front of the office.

780
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:42,270
But why is the previous patient
taking too long?

781
00:48:42,604 --> 00:48:45,356
-A lot of people are waiting.
-I'm sorry.

782
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,319
Appointments may run long
when there's a lot to explain.

783
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:50,820
Please wait a little longer.

784
00:48:52,155 --> 00:48:54,741
It's been hours since I took
my ultrasound. Why am I still waiting?

785
00:48:54,824 --> 00:48:56,659
Aren't you Ms. Han Seung-hui?

786
00:48:56,743 --> 00:49:01,080
There are five more patients before you.
Please wait a little longer.

787
00:49:01,164 --> 00:49:02,540
How much longer must I wait?

788
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,500
What's the point of making appointments?

789
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,461
I'm sorry.

790
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:12,133
At our hospital, two patients
can be booked for every ten minutes.

791
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:15,094
And that's the only way we can accept
appointments due to the system.

792
00:49:15,678 --> 00:49:19,057
As you know,
Professor Yang has a lot of patients.

793
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:22,018
I am sorry for making you wait every time.

794
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,062
I hope you can understand.

795
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:25,939
Okay.

796
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,816
No fever, right?

797
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,111
Let me know once you get the X-ray scan.

798
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,864
What's the blood type of the donor?

799
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:36,074
He's a type-A.

800
00:49:37,325 --> 00:49:39,953
Kim Yeong-je, the second patient
on the list, is in Geochang.

801
00:49:40,036 --> 00:49:43,623
Even if we get ready while he gets here,
the liver won't be viable.

802
00:49:43,706 --> 00:49:44,874
What about Moon Jeong-hwa?

803
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:46,542
She said she'd wait a bit longer.

804
00:49:46,626 --> 00:49:49,629
She's been feeling well,
so she doesn't want it for now.

805
00:49:50,213 --> 00:49:52,632
Yoo Dong-jin doesn't have
the same blood type.

806
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:54,968
Well...

807
00:49:57,512 --> 00:49:58,805
Type-A.

808
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:01,307
We have one more type-A patient
at the hospital.

809
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:03,059
Lee Chang-hak?

810
00:50:03,142 --> 00:50:05,812
Yes. His blood type is A.

811
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:21,619
My son.

812
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:32,880
He used to be so tiny like this.

813
00:50:35,591 --> 00:50:37,677
When did you grow up so much, son?

814
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:43,808
Jung-min.

815
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:48,187
This is yours.

816
00:50:50,023 --> 00:50:52,483
Your dad and I

817
00:50:54,527 --> 00:50:57,030
love you so much,

818
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:00,158
so we kept this all this time.

819
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:04,245
But now, you should keep it.

820
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,207
My son.

821
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:11,502
I am not

822
00:51:13,421 --> 00:51:15,298
ready yet.

823
00:51:16,716 --> 00:51:17,925
So

824
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:22,638
don't leave us here.

825
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:24,557
Jung-min.

826
00:51:26,142 --> 00:51:27,393
Jung-min.

827
00:51:28,644 --> 00:51:30,938
Your dad and I

828
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:35,985
love you so much, our dear son.

829
00:51:40,615 --> 00:51:43,618
Don't leave us. Promise me.

830
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:45,912
Have you been well?

831
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:48,122
-It's been two weeks.
-Yes, doctor.

832
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:49,207
Is the baby active?

833
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:53,336
It's been about two days
since the baby has been quiet.

834
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:56,798
Perhaps, I didn't feel any movements
because I was sleeping.

835
00:51:56,964 --> 00:51:58,174
My baby is okay, right?

836
00:51:58,257 --> 00:52:00,760
I read online that that happens
in the last month of pregnancy.

837
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:03,387
Shall we check if your baby is doing okay?

838
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:36,796
Well, Professor Kim.

839
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:41,217
Why don't we try again from the front?

840
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:53,354
We can use an artificial artery to bypass
the ascending and descending aorta.

841
00:52:53,646 --> 00:52:56,190
And if we ligate the operated area
from top to bottom,

842
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:57,233
wouldn't it be isolated?

843
00:52:57,942 --> 00:52:58,818
How are his vitals?

844
00:52:59,735 --> 00:53:02,947
His BP is stable with 0.05mg of epidural
and 0.1mg of norepinephrine.

845
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:05,700
Can he urinate?

846
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:07,451
He can urinate with 5mg of Lasix.

847
00:53:07,535 --> 00:53:08,953
Every hour, it goes over 100.

848
00:53:10,913 --> 00:53:13,124
Let's try it. Ask them to open the OR.

849
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,250
Okay.

850
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:23,718
Well,

851
00:53:24,594 --> 00:53:26,721
I checked multiple times.

852
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:30,892
But I didn't detect any heart movement.

853
00:53:39,942 --> 00:53:41,235
Are you saying

854
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:47,617
my baby is dead?

855
00:53:49,911 --> 00:53:51,037
Yes.

856
00:53:51,412 --> 00:53:55,208
It looks like the heart stopped beating
in your womb.

857
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:59,712
I don't know what caused it for now.

858
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:03,507
I will be able to find the cause
after we take the baby out.

859
00:54:18,314 --> 00:54:19,232
Doctor.

860
00:54:20,983 --> 00:54:22,485
No...

861
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,488
Doctor! No.

862
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:26,906
Doctor...

863
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:29,742
My baby...

864
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,851
We'll now administer the anesthesia.

865
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,105
Relax and breathe.

866
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,191
Don't be nervous.

867
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:05,069
Yes, good.

868
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:23,587
As for the ischemia time, what are we at?

869
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:26,841
About ten hours. The biopsy results
look good. The liver should be fine.

870
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:32,847
Let's do this quickly. Scalpel, please.

871
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:47,778
WE ARE SORRY FOR THE DELAY

872
00:55:51,866 --> 00:55:53,451
I'm sorry, Doctor.

873
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:55,619
Here.

874
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,582
It's okay. Don't worry about us.

875
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:02,835
Take your time to calm down.
You can stay here for a bit.

876
00:56:03,419 --> 00:56:04,545
We're okay.

877
00:56:05,546 --> 00:56:07,214
I'm sorry, Doctor...

878
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:17,725
-Shall I tell the patients outside...
-Doctor...

879
00:56:19,518 --> 00:56:21,103
...that our system is down or something?

880
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:25,483
No, there's no need. It's okay.

881
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,578
She's taking forever.

882
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,497
Excuse me.

883
00:56:40,373 --> 00:56:41,665
Don't say anything.

884
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:03,104
NAME: BAEK SEON-JEONG
AGE: 48

885
00:57:05,398 --> 00:57:07,441
Unfortunately,
the situation is pretty bad.

886
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:11,070
She has a brain hemorrhage
accompanied by severe swelling.

887
00:57:12,154 --> 00:57:15,658
It's got to the point
that the contrast agent doesn't even work.

888
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:22,415
At the moment, she's unconscious
and can't breathe on her own.

889
00:57:22,498 --> 00:57:24,166
So we believe she's brain-dead.

890
00:57:25,334 --> 00:57:29,547
It's highly likely that she'll pass away
within a week or two.

891
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:33,884
No way...

892
00:57:37,596 --> 00:57:39,014
Mom...

893
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:42,643
Mom!

894
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:46,188
-Honey...
-Mom!

895
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:47,773
-Mom!
-Honey.

896
00:57:51,193 --> 00:57:52,361
Chi-hong.

897
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:56,449
I was so surprised when I saw her name.

898
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:58,200
Why?

899
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:01,620
She has the exact same name
as the patient who passed away

900
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:03,205
when I was a fourth-year resident.

901
00:58:05,124 --> 00:58:07,585
You remember all your patients' names?

902
00:58:07,668 --> 00:58:08,836
Well...

903
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:11,922
From the day she was brought in to the ER

904
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:14,633
to the moment she passed away
in the ICU after her surgery,

905
00:58:14,717 --> 00:58:16,510
I stayed by her side.

906
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:21,348
I thought she'd make it.

907
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:24,852
That's why I did nothing else and
just stayed by her side for over a week

908
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,729
while getting an earful from my professor,

909
00:58:28,814 --> 00:58:30,024
but she passed away.

910
00:58:31,233 --> 00:58:33,068
She also had SAH.

911
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:36,155
I beat myself up so much
after she passed away.

912
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:39,617
Maybe it's my fault that she passed away.

913
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:42,203
"Had I been smarter,

914
00:58:43,245 --> 00:58:45,372
she probably could've lived."
I kept thinking that.

915
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:50,044
She was so beautiful.

916
00:58:51,504 --> 00:58:54,256
I still remember what she looked like
as well as her name.

917
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:56,509
I remember everything vividly.

918
00:58:58,344 --> 00:59:01,514
Her name was also Baek Seon-jeong.

919
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:09,563
It was you.

920
00:59:15,236 --> 00:59:17,488
I had no idea.

921
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:19,490
Professor Chae...

922
00:59:22,117 --> 00:59:23,160
Yun-bok.

923
00:59:24,787 --> 00:59:25,913
What's wrong?

924
00:59:31,585 --> 00:59:32,586
What's the matter?

925
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:36,423
What is it?

926
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:46,183
I miss my mom.

927
00:59:57,403 --> 00:59:58,445
Professor Chae.

928
01:00:01,323 --> 01:00:04,535
I miss my mom so much.

929
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:10,666
My gosh.

930
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:16,672
You grew up
into such a wonderful young lady.

931
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:21,635
Your mom

932
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:24,805
must be so proud of you,
watching over you from heaven.

933
01:00:28,017 --> 01:00:30,603
Why are you crying?
She'll be heartbroken if she sees this.

934
01:00:33,188 --> 01:00:34,815
Don't cry.

935
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:36,358
Okay.

936
01:00:43,032 --> 01:00:43,949
My gosh.

937
01:00:55,336 --> 01:00:56,170
It's okay.

938
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:11,457
Mr. Kim Hyeon-su?

939
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:14,418
Doctor!

940
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:17,088
I was waiting for you.

941
01:01:17,588 --> 01:01:19,256
-Me?
-Yes.

942
01:01:19,715 --> 01:01:22,718
I asked the front desk for your number,
but they said they can't give it out.

943
01:01:23,594 --> 01:01:25,763
So I thought I should just wait here
until you showed up.

944
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:27,681
This year must be my lucky year.

945
01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:31,185
Well, it seems so.

946
01:01:33,396 --> 01:01:36,023
By the way, you look great.

947
01:01:36,982 --> 01:01:40,152
You don't look like someone who underwent
brain surgery three months ago.

948
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:41,904
Thank you.

949
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:45,699
Well, Doctor Ahn.

950
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:53,082
This is for you.

951
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,794
I know that doctors can't accept gifts,

952
01:01:56,877 --> 01:01:58,212
but still...

953
01:01:59,004 --> 01:02:02,174
Please accept it.

954
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:05,094
My gosh...

955
01:02:07,638 --> 01:02:08,889
Gosh, this is...

956
01:02:13,894 --> 01:02:17,106
It's not expensive.
It costs under 20,000 won.

957
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,068
My gosh.

958
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,029
Next week,

959
01:02:26,198 --> 01:02:27,658
I'll be returning to the police.

960
01:02:29,452 --> 01:02:31,579
My gosh, congratulations.

961
01:02:33,372 --> 01:02:37,168
It's a desk job, and I'll be working
short shifts for the time being.

962
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:38,335
But still...

963
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:42,256
I thought I'd never return to the force.

964
01:02:44,508 --> 01:02:46,594
But thanks to you, I can go back to work.

965
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,518
I hope this pen can be

966
01:02:56,061 --> 01:02:58,647
one of the many pens you always keep
in your pocket.

967
01:03:01,025 --> 01:03:02,693
And I hope this pen can cheer you up

968
01:03:03,694 --> 01:03:05,613
when things get stressful.

969
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,782
There are people who gained new life
thanks to you,

970
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:12,453
so don't be discouraged and cheer up.

971
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:21,962
You must be busy. I'll get going, then.

972
01:03:22,046 --> 01:03:23,589
I'll see you at my next appointment.

973
01:03:29,261 --> 01:03:31,972
All right.
See you at your next appointment.

974
01:04:04,463 --> 01:04:07,258
Doctor, how did the surgery go?
Did it go well?

975
01:04:10,177 --> 01:04:12,846
Yes, the surgery went well.

976
01:04:14,765 --> 01:04:16,600
He didn't even bleed much
during the surgery.

977
01:04:16,684 --> 01:04:19,228
We'll have to do a blood test
when he wakes up to be sure,

978
01:04:20,104 --> 01:04:22,022
but the surgery itself
went as well as it could,

979
01:04:22,147 --> 01:04:23,941
so I don't think you should be worried.

980
01:04:24,858 --> 01:04:27,736
We've overcome a huge hurdle.

981
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,239
Thank you so much, Doctor.

982
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:33,617
I really think this is a miracle.

983
01:04:34,243 --> 01:04:37,997
I'll be grateful to the donor
for the rest of my life.

984
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,665
Thank you very much.

985
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:44,461
Your dad's surgery went very well.

986
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:48,716
So my dad isn't ill anymore?

987
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:53,345
He still is. Just a little bit though.

988
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:57,141
But he'll recover soon.

989
01:04:57,975 --> 01:04:58,976
Don't worry.

990
01:05:00,436 --> 01:05:01,729
Thank you. I'm grateful.

991
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:06,066
I am a lot more

992
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,235
grateful.

993
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:09,778
Doctor.

994
01:05:10,446 --> 01:05:12,281
I will take the test.

995
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:17,077
And when you get the test result,

996
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:24,293
please tell them that I wasn't a match.

997
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:31,383
I'm sorry.

998
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,678
I'm really sorry.

999
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:48,233
Dong-ju.

1000
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:12,257
GIVE YOUR MOM A BIG HUG!

1001
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:30,818
I'm okay.

1002
01:06:32,778 --> 01:06:34,488
Don't cry.

1003
01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:06,270
What?

1004
01:07:07,563 --> 01:07:09,273
You have something to tell me, right?

1005
01:07:10,107 --> 01:07:11,442
Is something bothering you?

1006
01:07:13,152 --> 01:07:14,236
No.

1007
01:07:29,668 --> 01:07:30,794
I agree.

1008
01:07:33,547 --> 01:07:36,467
I agree with what you're thinking now.

1009
01:07:57,738 --> 01:07:59,239
You can read minds, can't you?

1010
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:02,743
People call me psychic, you know.

1011
01:08:07,581 --> 01:08:10,834
I think there are three types of people
in this world.

1012
01:08:12,085 --> 01:08:14,588
First, those who are happiest
when they're eating something good.

1013
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:19,176
Ik-jun and Jun-wan
are the perfect examples.

1014
01:08:38,445 --> 01:08:40,197
It's mine. It's my <i>ramyeon</i>.

1015
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,867
This is my first meal of the day.
Go get a new one.

1016
01:08:43,951 --> 01:08:46,328
-Jeez!
-You go get a new one. I'm exhausted.

1017
01:08:46,411 --> 01:08:48,455
Me too!
Do I look like I'm brimming with energy?

1018
01:08:50,332 --> 01:08:53,293
-Cut it out, you crazy prick.
-Come on, dude.

1019
01:08:53,377 --> 01:08:54,461
-Give it back.
-I'm not done.

1020
01:08:54,545 --> 01:08:55,379
Get a new one!

1021
01:08:55,462 --> 01:08:57,589
No! I want to eat this!

1022
01:08:58,423 --> 01:09:01,677
Then there are those who enjoy food
the most when they're eating alone.

1023
01:09:03,762 --> 01:09:07,558
I bet Seok-hyeong is eating <i>ramyeon</i>
all by himself now while watching

1024
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:08,809
<i>New Journey to the West.</i>

1025
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:25,158
Who is it?

1026
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,580
Professor Yang, even this resident
working the night shift

1027
01:09:29,663 --> 01:09:32,040
at the medical office
heard that you're eating <i>ramyeon</i>,

1028
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:33,834
so I came to eat with you.

1029
01:09:34,084 --> 01:09:35,502
I can join you, right?

1030
01:09:36,962 --> 01:09:39,214
Sure.

1031
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:41,675
Great.

1032
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,096
All right.

1033
01:09:47,973 --> 01:09:51,518
Then... All right, be careful.

1034
01:09:56,023 --> 01:09:57,065
Perfect.

1035
01:09:58,734 --> 01:10:00,444
And the fish cake bars.

1036
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:01,486
Nice. This is perfect.

1037
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:13,749
-Can I dig in?
-Yes, of course. Enjoy.

1038
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:17,169
Lastly, there's you.

1039
01:10:19,421 --> 01:10:22,341
Seeing others enjoy good food
makes you happier than

1040
01:10:22,841 --> 01:10:24,092
when you are eating it yourself.

1041
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:26,845
I'm not like that.

1042
01:10:27,429 --> 01:10:28,680
You are like that.

1043
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:42,778
DECEMBER 3, 2019
10:22 P.M.

1044
01:10:43,612 --> 01:10:45,572
It's already past ten o'clock.

1045
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,452
Ik-sun must be on the plane now.
I didn't even have a chance to call her.

1046
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,793
Jeez, what was that about?

1047
01:10:59,127 --> 01:11:00,295
What's with him?

1048
01:11:01,004 --> 01:11:03,674
<i>The number you have called is unavailable.</i>

1049
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:34,246
<i>I'm really okay,
so don't worry about it if you're busy.</i>

1050
01:11:34,329 --> 01:11:37,582
<i>I just left home.
I'll text you when I'm at the airport.</i>

1051
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:40,961
<i>I'm at the airport. It's not busy,
so I should be able to check-in quickly.</i>

1052
01:11:41,044 --> 01:11:44,756
<i>Both my mom and dad are crying.
I'm crying too.</i>

1053
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,050
<i>The check-in is done. I'm inside now.</i>

1054
01:11:47,134 --> 01:11:48,760
<i>I want to hear your voice.</i>

1055
01:11:48,844 --> 01:11:50,345
<i>I guess you have emergency surgery.</i>

1056
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:52,305
<i>I have so much time
until my boarding time.</i>

1057
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:54,766
<i>Take a breather after the surgery
and call me.</i>

1058
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,393
<i>Boarding will close in five minutes.</i>

1059
01:11:56,476 --> 01:11:59,146
<i>I wanted to hear your voice. I'm sad.</i>

1060
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:01,648
<i>I'm on the plane now.
I have to turn my phone off.</i>

1061
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:03,692
<i>I hope everything is okay.</i>

1062
01:12:04,234 --> 01:12:05,694
<i>It's okay if you're in surgery,</i>

1063
01:12:05,777 --> 01:12:08,822
<i>but I'm worried you can't check your phone
because something bad happened.</i>

1064
01:12:11,241 --> 01:12:12,492
<i>Bye, for real.</i>

1065
01:12:13,326 --> 01:12:14,953
<i>I'll call you when I arrive.</i>

1066
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,622
<i>I love you, babe.</i>

1067
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:30,427
No one's here.

1068
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:32,345
Leave me alone.

1069
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:37,976
Professor Kim.

1070
01:12:38,935 --> 01:12:41,104
The patient's tube drainage
has been under 100 per hour,

1071
01:12:41,271 --> 01:12:43,231
and the bleeding seems
to have stopped as well.

1072
01:12:43,398 --> 01:12:44,649
The vitals have also stabilized.

1073
01:12:46,026 --> 01:12:49,738
I thought I'd come and tell you
this happy news in person.

1074
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:51,198
I'll be off, then.

1075
01:12:51,281 --> 01:12:52,115
Jae-hak.

1076
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:57,120
Let's go get some fresh air.
My head hurts so much.

1077
01:12:58,705 --> 01:13:00,832
I took the CSAT four times
and the bar exam six times.

1078
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:02,084
That's ten years in total.

1079
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:04,544
That's why I know for a fact
that I can study very hard.

1080
01:13:05,378 --> 01:13:08,882
I'm a wimp, so I'm not confident when
it comes to exams and the actual work.

1081
01:13:09,716 --> 01:13:13,720
But I was always good at studying
and memorizing things all day long.

1082
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:16,473
That's why I thought
I'd have a successful career as a doctor

1083
01:13:16,556 --> 01:13:18,016
because you need to study a lot.

1084
01:13:18,308 --> 01:13:19,935
I thought I should be able

1085
01:13:20,018 --> 01:13:22,562
to live a decent life
if I became a doctor,

1086
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:25,148
so I studied very hard and became one.

1087
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:30,695
But then, my gosh. I learned that having
good judgment is more important than

1088
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:32,030
your ability to study well.

1089
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:35,117
Every day... No, you have to make a choice
every moment.

1090
01:13:35,909 --> 01:13:37,911
I mean, that's what surgery is all about.

1091
01:13:37,994 --> 01:13:40,288
If a patient's condition worsens,
should he or she

1092
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:41,957
be hooked up to the ECMO
or transferred to the OR?

1093
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,709
I struggle every time
I have to make such decisions.

1094
01:13:46,753 --> 01:13:49,339
Professor Kim, you see...

1095
01:13:50,173 --> 01:13:52,300
Indecisiveness is my biggest weakness.

1096
01:13:54,344 --> 01:13:56,054
I have a lot of knowledge,

1097
01:13:56,138 --> 01:13:58,598
but I don't know when and how
it should be used.

1098
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:02,394
What do I do, Professor Kim?

1099
01:14:03,562 --> 01:14:05,981
My patients could live or die
depending on what I decide to do.

1100
01:14:08,525 --> 01:14:10,152
What if I make the wrong decision?

1101
01:14:12,487 --> 01:14:16,783
I'll encounter hundreds of thousands
of moments when I must make a decision.

1102
01:14:19,327 --> 01:14:21,037
Gosh, I don't know if I can do it.

1103
01:14:23,623 --> 01:14:25,083
What should I do

1104
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:27,335
every time that happens?

1105
01:14:33,383 --> 01:14:34,551
Ask me.

1106
01:14:37,053 --> 01:14:40,348
When you're feeling overwhelmed
because you must make a lot of decisions,

1107
01:14:41,016 --> 01:14:43,977
you can ask me how to handle
a few important cases.

1108
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:51,359
I'll do my best to help you out
if I'm not too busy.

1109
01:14:57,532 --> 01:14:58,992
Jae-hak.

1110
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:09,211
I want to give this to my girlfriend,

1111
01:15:11,129 --> 01:15:12,756
but she doesn't like things like this.

1112
01:15:13,882 --> 01:15:16,051
Christmas is just around the corner,

1113
01:15:17,552 --> 01:15:19,554
so I want to send it to her
as a Christmas gift.

1114
01:15:21,598 --> 01:15:23,016
Will it be okay to send this to her?

1115
01:15:25,227 --> 01:15:26,895
Am I putting too much pressure on her?

1116
01:15:31,942 --> 01:15:33,318
Ask her.

1117
01:15:35,278 --> 01:15:37,239
Ask your girlfriend.

1118
01:15:39,324 --> 01:15:40,992
You two love each other, right?

1119
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,535
Is it one-sided?

1120
01:15:43,995 --> 01:15:45,247
Then ask her.

1121
01:15:46,164 --> 01:15:48,708
She'll give you the answer.

1122
01:15:54,005 --> 01:15:55,340
I have to say,

1123
01:15:57,175 --> 01:15:58,843
you're clueless when it comes to dating.

1124
01:16:00,095 --> 01:16:02,806
Gosh, you frustrate me so much.

1125
01:16:11,398 --> 01:16:12,315
There.

1126
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:15,068
The arm, please.

1127
01:16:15,485 --> 01:16:16,861
Good. This arm.

1128
01:16:18,029 --> 01:16:19,030
Look at me.

1129
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,994
U-ju, be a good boy and be good to Auntie.

1130
01:16:24,077 --> 01:16:26,746
Wait for just ten days
even if you miss Daddy, okay?

1131
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,498
Ten days? How many days is that?

1132
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:31,334
Ten days... It's more than nine days

1133
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:32,460
but less than 11 days.

1134
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:37,465
U-ju, Daddy will be back
when you finish counting

1135
01:16:37,549 --> 01:16:39,259
with all ten fingers.

1136
01:16:39,342 --> 01:16:41,636
My gosh, you're such a pro.

1137
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,515
Professor Lee, I hope you don't have to
work all the time when you're there.

1138
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:47,392
You should catch up on sleep

1139
01:16:47,475 --> 01:16:49,269
and go shopping while you're there.

1140
01:16:49,352 --> 01:16:51,646
Of course. I should be able
to take two to three days off.

1141
01:16:52,147 --> 01:16:53,565
Yes, come here.

1142
01:16:53,648 --> 01:16:55,317
There we go.

1143
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,153
U-ju, tell me the acrostic poem for Daddy.

1144
01:16:58,236 --> 01:17:00,864
You learned it at the daycare yesterday.
Go!

1145
01:17:00,947 --> 01:17:02,240
Daddy.

1146
01:17:02,324 --> 01:17:04,075
-Next?
-Bye-bye.

1147
01:17:06,286 --> 01:17:08,455
Don't you think U-ju should join Mensa?

1148
01:17:08,538 --> 01:17:09,789
He's as talented as Shakespeare.

1149
01:17:09,873 --> 01:17:12,459
That's exactly what I was thinking
yesterday.

1150
01:17:12,542 --> 01:17:15,628
-U-ju, come up with one for Auntie.
-Sure.

1151
01:17:15,712 --> 01:17:16,963
-Go!
-Auntie.

1152
01:17:17,047 --> 01:17:18,715
-Next!
-Bye-bye.

1153
01:17:22,552 --> 01:17:24,637
The daycare bus is probably here now.

1154
01:17:24,721 --> 01:17:26,014
Say bye to Daddy.

1155
01:17:26,306 --> 01:17:28,183
Have a good trip, Daddy.

1156
01:17:28,266 --> 01:17:29,142
Yes, sir.

1157
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:30,894
What?

1158
01:17:32,228 --> 01:17:36,566
Father, bring me
a ton of cookies and chocolates.

1159
01:17:42,822 --> 01:17:46,076
Yes, sir. I will. No problem.

1160
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:50,538
Oh, boy. That nearly killed me. All right.

1161
01:17:50,997 --> 01:17:52,123
Bye, Daddy!

1162
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:53,333
It still tickles.

1163
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:58,171
You have to wear it at all times, okay?

1164
01:17:58,254 --> 01:18:01,174
<i>You too.
You double-checked the address, right?</i>

1165
01:18:01,257 --> 01:18:02,801
<i>What if it gets misdelivered?</i>

1166
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:06,096
<i>The address is quite complicated,
so the mailmen often make mistakes.</i>

1167
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:08,723
I triple-checked it,
so I'm sure it won't be misdelivered.

1168
01:18:09,349 --> 01:18:11,768
You should go to bed.
It's after midnight there.

1169
01:18:11,851 --> 01:18:12,936
<i>All right.</i>

1170
01:18:13,436 --> 01:18:16,398
<i>Bye, babe. I love you.</i>

1171
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,941
I love you too.

1172
01:18:35,834 --> 01:18:37,085
Hello.

1173
01:18:37,752 --> 01:18:39,295
Hi, Yun-bok.

1174
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:41,592
Hello.

1175
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,802
Hi, Yun-bok.

1176
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:46,680
What brings you by?

1177
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:50,643
There's something I forgot to show Dr. Ahn
when I was doing the handover.

1178
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,187
Chi-hong is moving today.

1179
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,314
Oh, right.

1180
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,608
I bought him a gift for that
and forgot all about it.

1181
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,324
What are you doing tonight?

1182
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,410
-Me?
-Yes.

1183
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:10,079
You are not on-call tonight.

1184
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,665
I don't really have any plans.

1185
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,208
Then how about dinner together?

1186
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,724
Hey, yes.

1187
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:32,726
Hong-do.

1188
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,313
What? You're feeling sick?

1189
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,023
You feel like you're dying?

1190
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,317
Yes, okay.

1191
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,499
Message me when you're off work.

1192
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:57,751
I'll meet you in the lobby.

1193
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,295
Well, sure.

1194
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,037
Hey.

1195
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,998
Seriously,
what brings you all the way here?

1196
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,208
Shouldn't you have left by now?

1197
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,961
Gosh, it's so nice here.

1198
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,340
I came here
because I'd like your advice on something.

1199
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,426
I still have about five hours.

1200
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:55,392
Listen up, okay?

1201
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,731
I have a friend

1202
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,824
whom I've known for a long time.

1203
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,789
But I started to like her.

1204
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,103
If I tell her how I feel,
things might get a little awkward.

1205
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,732
But if I chicken out again

1206
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:46,985
and not tell her,

1207
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,574
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

1208
01:21:58,831 --> 01:21:59,957
What should I do?

1209
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,237
Take your time.
You can answer when I'm back.

1210
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,405
Bye.

1211
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,215
CHIEF

1212
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,393
<i>Congratulations on your new home
and becoming a chief resident.</i>

1213
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:47,314
<i>Dr. Ahn Chi-hong,
you're already doing a great job.</i>

1214
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,857
<i>I'll always be rooting for you.</i>

1215
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,945
<i>First, try not to get too nervous
during surgery.</i>

1216
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,656
<i>What you need now is a heart of steel.</i>

1217
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,993
<i>Second, focus on bleeding control
when performing brain tumor surgery.</i>

1218
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,246
<i>That will decide whether
the surgery will be a success.</i>

1219
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,249
<i>Third, make use of impactful diagrams
and videos</i>

1220
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:07,918
<i>when you're preparing
for your presentation.</i>

1221
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,336
<i>And practice is a must.</i>

1222
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,338
<i>From Song-hwa.</i>

1223
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,264
<i>Do you</i>

1224
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:22,683
<i>like me?</i>

1225
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:25,519
<i>I like you. Yes.</i>

1226
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,899
I was going to tell you,

1227
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,026
but I couldn't find the right time.

1228
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,904
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

1229
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:39,908
Don't.

1230
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:44,496
Hey. Stop talking. What's wrong with you?

1231
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,708
Well, it's not something
I have control over.

1232
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:53,213
I can't just stop because you told me to.

1233
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,811
I'll get going.

1234
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,315
Bye.

1235
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:28,790
PROFESSOR CHAE SONG-HWA

1236
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,175
They are cute.

1237
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,552
I used to be young like them.

1238
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:26,973
I'm sorry.

1239
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:29,851
Anyway, we have our precious med students.

1240
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,770
Let's listen to why
they applied to med school.

1241
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,439
What's wrong with him? Just let them go.

1242
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,525
Right? You don't like that either.

1243
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,196
-Pardon?
-I'm sorry.

1244
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:43,240
I won't talk to you.

1245
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:49,746
Both of my parents are doctors,
so I didn't have much choice--

1246
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,040
Hey, Seon-bin.
We're not interested in your story.

1247
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,768
You have to work tomorrow?

1248
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:14,396
I feel bad for you.

1249
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,273
Since when did we get Christmas off?

1250
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:19,693
Hey, tomorrow is Christmas. Don't you
have to spend time with your <i>bidulgi</i>?

1251
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:22,654
She's away at the moment.
And I also have to go into work briefly.

1252
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,990
-Hey, did you get me a gift?
-No.

1253
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,075
Seok-hyeong, what did you decide to do?

1254
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,285
Have you made your decision?

1255
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:32,330
What?

1256
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,082
A decision about what?

1257
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,917
You too. We'll talk about that later.

1258
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:38,044
Seok-hyeong, tell us.

1259
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,589
Is something else going on
with his family?

1260
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:45,302
His dad wrote in his will that he'd like
Seok-hyeong to inherit the company.

1261
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,345
-What?
-What?

1262
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,723
Hey, then are you going
to quit being a doctor?

1263
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:57,439
Just tell us.
Tell us already, you silly bear.

1264
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,232
Let go, and I'll tell you.

1265
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,912
Why would I run the company?

1266
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,291
I already told everyone
that I'm not interested.

1267
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,835
We'll find a management specialist
to run the company.

1268
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:20,337
You made the right choice.

1269
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,172
-Of course.
-Why would you do that?

1270
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:24,257
Well, I think it'd be nice to have
the opportunity

1271
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:26,343
to run a company before you get too old.

1272
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:27,552
I think it's a bad idea.

1273
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,971
What's so bad about it? When else
will he be called "Mr. Chairman"?

1274
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:30,889
Do it.

1275
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,058
Just come back if it doesn't work out.

1276
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,104
I don't want to waste time.

1277
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,819
My time is too precious for that.

1278
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,079
I want to live doing the things I like

1279
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,290
and the things

1280
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:59,084
that I want to do right now.

1281
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,340
That's why I wanted to start a band.

1282
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:11,179
I...

1283
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,601
used you guys.

1284
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:22,691
As if.

1285
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,653
-What's he saying?
-That nutjob.

1286
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,155
What is wrong with him today?

1287
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:32,576
-What are you saying?
-That's absurd.

1288
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:35,328
-What's with him?
-You silly bear.

1289
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:37,289
-What's wrong with him?
-My gosh.

1290
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,165
He actually looks like
the statue of Agrippa

1291
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,209
instead of a silly bear.

1292
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,838
-Hey, stop it.
-I see a lot of shadows.

1293
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,424
-Hey.
-What's that under his eyes?

1294
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,384
-The gradation...
-Let me see.

1295
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,344
-Cut it out.
-Come on. Let's see!

1296
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,772
Hey, why are you drinking that?

1297
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,196
Because I'm singing a line today.

1298

DECEMBER 24, 2019
11:20 A.M.

1313
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,141
Oh, hello.

1314
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,310
Ji-hyeon, say hello.

1315
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,645
Say, "Hello, Doctor.
Thank you for saving my life."

1316
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,064
Thank you.

1317
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,400
Doctor!

1318
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:54,777
My gosh.

1319
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:59,866
Ji-hyeon, is your stomach okay now?
It doesn't hurt anymore?

1320
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,493
No, it doesn't hurt at all now.

1321
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,244
Gosh, you're so adorable.

1322
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,789
What brings you by?
You don't have an appointment today.

1323
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:08,666
It's Christmas Eve, you know.

1324
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:12,253
You're the person we wanted
to see the most on Christmas Eve.

1325
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:14,881
Oh, my.

1326
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,970
Merry Christmas.

1327
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:26,476
It's healed nicely.

1328
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:28,853
If you have a fever or experience
other types of discomfort,

1329
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,438
come to the ER anytime.

1330
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:33,274
Then we'll see you
at your next appointment in two weeks.

1331
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:34,901
-We'll remove the stitches then.
-Okay.

1332
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:36,694
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1333
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:37,904
Thank you.

1334
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,117
-Son.
-Yes?

1335
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:46,621
What's the first thing you want to do
when you leave the hospital?

1336
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:48,957
I'll do anything for you.

1337
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,833
I mean, you nearly died.

1338
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,835
I'd happily do anything for my dear son.

1339
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:54,629
I want kimchi stew.

1340
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:58,299
I want to eat your kimchi stew, Mom.

1341
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:00,552
Gosh, that's it?

1342
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,680
Yes, I just want to go home
and eat a home-cooked meal.

1343
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:05,932
That's what I want to do the most, Mom.

1344
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:08,560
Me too.

1345
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:15,525
You can be discharged tomorrow.

1346
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,069
Really?

1347
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,197
Hello, Doctor.

1348
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:26,661
Well, there's nothing more
we can do for you here.

1349
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:28,746
Vacate the room, please.

1350
01:34:29,872 --> 01:34:30,707
Thank you.

1351
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,167
I owe it all to you, Doctor.

1352
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:34,168
Don't mention it.

1353
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,671
-Dong-ju.
-Dong-ju.

1354
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,131
Merry Christmas.

1355
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,508
Oh, one more thing.

1356
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:42,343
Merry Christmas.

1357
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:45,513
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1358
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:51,937
Question.

1359
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,774
Common indications
for liver transplantation?

1360
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:01,279
Chronic liver failure,
acute liver failure,

1361
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:02,822
hepatocellular carcinoma, and so on.

1362
01:35:02,905 --> 01:35:04,407
Bingo. Have you been studying?

1363
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,534
Yes, I had a feeling
that you'd test me today.

1364
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:09,871
Well done. Doctors have to study a lot.

1365
01:35:10,913 --> 01:35:12,874
You can't save patients
by being friendly to them.

1366
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:15,501
-Right.
-I'll quiz you every time I see you.

1367
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:17,420
Two questions if you get it wrong.

1368
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:30,975
It's good news.

1369
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:32,769
Why are you crying?

1370
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:36,439
I feel so bad for my wife.

1371
01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:40,735
She's been so stressed out,

1372
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,698
but there was nothing I could do for her.

1373
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:50,912
Doctor, do you mind saying that
one more time?

1374
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:57,543
You no longer need
to worry about premature birth.

1375
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:03,675
The baby now weighs over 1.5kg,
which means it's growing well.

1376
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,968
Everything seems stable so far,

1377
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:09,347
so it's most likely
that you'll be fine until you're due.

1378
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:12,517
You no longer need to be lying down
all the time.

1379
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,937
Like other expecting moms, you can now
return to non-strenuous daily activities.

1380
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:17,897
Thank you.

1381
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:23,569
You held out

1382
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:26,239
really well.

1383
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:07,572

1400
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,450
DECEMBER 25, 2019
06:30 P.M.

1401
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:46,170
Where's the nail clipper?

1402
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:16,242
-What's up?
-<i>A package came for you.</i>

1403
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:19,245
-A package? I'm not expecting anything.
-<i>Well...</i>

1404
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:20,997
<i>It's actually a returned package.</i>

1405
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:08,961
Who is it?

1406
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:09,921
It's me, Gyeo-ul.

1407
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:12,965
Come in.

1408
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,694
What is it?

1409
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:41,410
Professor Ahn.

1410
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:45,665
I...

1411
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,520
Professor Ahn... I...

1412
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:12,233
I like you.

1413
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:20,700
I'm sorry.

1414
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:22,743
Why am I crying?

1415
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,454
Sorry.

1416
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:27,289
I'm sorry.

1417
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,593
I know it's not my place to say this,

1418
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:46,058
but can you please stay at the hospital

1419
01:41:49,395 --> 01:41:51,480
instead of becoming a priest?

1420
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:02,033
Please stay by my side

1421
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:07,538
instead of God's.

1422
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,921
I'm sorry.

1423
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,051
I'm sorry, Professor Ahn.

1424
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:30,287
<i>Gyeo-ul.</i>

1425
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:31,997
<i>Since</i>

1426
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:35,334
when did you like Jeong-won?

1427
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:38,254
Isn't that obvious?

1428
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:44,802
Is it...

1429
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:49,765
Like love at first...

1430
01:43:54,436 --> 01:43:56,105
The moment I first saw him.

1431
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:01,152
I fell for him

1432
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:03,779
the moment I first saw him.

1433
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:11,370
Have some bread and milk.

1434
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:12,621
Thank you.

1435
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:17,334
Dr. Jang.

1436
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:20,254
Did you hear about the new professor
who's starting today?

1437
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:22,631
Yes, I heard he was
at Kangwoon Medical Center.

1438
01:44:22,715 --> 01:44:24,049
A professor of Pediatric Surgery.

1439
01:44:24,133 --> 01:44:26,927
That's right.
Pediatric surgeons are so rare.

1440
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,306
I heard he can perform operations
all by himself

1441
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,016
and handle appointments on his own.

1442
01:44:33,726 --> 01:44:37,271
So don't even worry about Pediatrics

1443
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:40,608
-and assist me--
-Guys, say hello.

1444
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,318
Today is his first day.

1445
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:44,653
Professor Ahn Jeong-won
of Pediatric Surgery.

1446
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:47,364
Hello.

1447
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:02,296
This is Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul,
the only resident in GS.

1448
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:03,964
I see.

1449
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:09,595
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ahn Jeong-won.

1450
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,643
Hello, I'm Jang Gyeo-ul.

1451
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:20,314
Hello, I'm Ahn Jeong-won.

1452
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:21,941
Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Bae-jin.

1453
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:23,108
Nice to meet you.

1454
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:26,362
-Nice to meet you. I'm Ahn Jeong-won.
-I'm Lee Ji-hun. Nice to meet you.

1455
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:28,739
-Nice to meet you.
-You're very handsome.

1456
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:30,282
My gosh, I'm flattered.

1457
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:32,910
<i>Right. Gyeo-ul is in the ER now.</i>

1458
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,119
My gosh, why?

1459
01:45:34,453 --> 01:45:36,455
It's gotten better after she got the shot.

1460
01:45:36,538 --> 01:45:38,582
I think she had anaphylaxis from NSAIDs.

1461
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:39,708
SUDDEN REACTION TO THE BODY

1462
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:42,336
Her face swelled 30 minutes
after taking the pill for cramps.

1463
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:43,629
Then, she couldn't breathe.

1464
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:45,798
She passed out like a scene in the movie.

1465
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:47,758
Oh, no. Please excuse me.

1466
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:50,761
She's much better now.

1467
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,179
She's probably asleep.

1468
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:01,397
Hey, "City Hall Subway Station" is fine
for tomorrow, right?

1469
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,400
Yes, I love all the songs by Zoo.

1470
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:06,402
I should practice tonight.

1471
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:09,280
Can you guys clean up mine? I have to go.

1472
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:56,660
Hello, Professor Ahn.

1473
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,163
You must be here for Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

1474
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:00,998
She's much better now.

1475
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:02,291
Let's go in.

1476
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,960
No, it's okay.
I got a call, so I have to go.

1477
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:06,837
I see.

1478
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:09,214
Wait.

1479
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,343
Take good care

1480
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:14,511
of Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

1481
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:16,430
Of course.

1482
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:22,770
<i>Seeing others enjoy good food
makes you happier than</i>

1483
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,022
when you are eating it yourself.

1484
01:47:26,023 --> 01:47:27,358
I'm not like that.

1485
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,776
You are like that.

1486
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,659
You made the right decision.

1487
01:47:39,244 --> 01:47:42,247
Stay here and save more lives.

1488
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,130
Don't tell the other guys
for the time being.

1489
01:47:52,091 --> 01:47:54,259
There's someone I want to tell first.

1490
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:14,613
Winter is here.

1491
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:20,244
The winter we've been waiting for.

1492
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:09,603
<i>Professor Yang, it's me, Min-ha.</i>

1493
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:12,147
<i>Do you have any plans for this evening?</i>

1494
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:15,192
<i>If not, let's have dinner together
at the steakhouse across the street.</i>

1495
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:16,193
<i>At 7:30 p.m.</i>

1496
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:22,449
<i>No pressure though.
You don't have to come.</i>

1497
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:25,744
<i>My friend lives in the area,
so I can eat with her if you can't come.</i>

1498
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:30,082
<i>But I really hope you can come.</i>

1499
01:50:52,104 --> 01:50:55,649
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER
WITH YOUR FRIENDS, MERRY CHRISTMAS

1500
01:50:59,194 --> 01:51:05,033
