HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,637
I didn't see this coming at all.

3
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:12,099
All of a sudden, she said
her peripheral vision was gone,

4
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,851
so I took her to an ophthalmologist.

5
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:16,312
The doctor told me to see a neurosurgeon.

6
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:19,482
But So-mi is okay, right?

7
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:27,990
She hasn't had her first period yet?

8
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:33,496
No. Is that a problem?

9
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:37,124
I see.

10
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:46,759
Look over here.

11
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:49,512
Do you see a mass here?

12
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:54,141
From the blood test, I see that
her prolactin level is quite elevated.

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,269
It's because there's a tumor
in her pituitary gland.

14
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:58,979
And the tumor is growing upward.

15
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:02,233
This part of the brain, optic chiasm,
is the crossing of the optic nerves,

16
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,151
and as you see,
the mass is pressing on this part.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,612
So there has been
a loss of her peripheral vision.

18
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,949
That might be the reason
she still hasn't had her first period.

19
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:11,909
Does it mean

20
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,287
I have a brain tumor?

21
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:18,499
In my opinion,
it may be a pituitary tumor.

22
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:22,419
I can officially diagnose it
based on the biopsy result.

23
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:24,922
They usually turn out to be benign,
so don't worry.

24
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,842
It's okay, So-mi. This is treatable.

25
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,344
It's definitely treatable.
Isn't that right, doctor?

26
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:31,846
Of course.

27
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,391
So-mi, it won't be open brain surgery.

28
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:37,268
It's called TSA surgery.

29
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,520
We insert an endoscope through your nose

30
00:01:39,603 --> 00:01:41,188
and scratch off the tumor.

31
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:43,315
If you take medication after the surgery,

32
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,901
you can recover from this
without a problem.

33
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,612
-Don't worry.
-Doctor.

34
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,657
When can she get the surgery?

35
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,702
There's no bleeding in her brain,
so it's not urgent.

36
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,161
But we shouldn't delay it.

37
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,997
Let's get her admitted and proceed.

38
00:01:58,581 --> 00:01:59,790
I'll get her admitted today

39
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:02,334
and proceed with a blood test,
ECG, and a chest X-ray

40
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,628
to see if she can get the surgery.

41
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:08,048
As for the surgery, I'll perform it
when our ENT doctor is available

42
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:10,009
and discuss when it will be.

43
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:11,886
I'll try to book it as soon as possible.

44
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,345
Thank you.

45
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:16,390
But she must have been experiencing
headaches and there must've been

46
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:19,518
a gradual loss of her peripheral vision.
Why didn't you come sooner?

47
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:21,896
Her tumor progressed quite a bit.

48
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,398
She just told me about it.

49
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:29,361
I just found out about it.
My gosh, I'm sorry.

50
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,615
Why are you sorry?

51
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,451
Excuse me.

52
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,871
Yes, what is it? I'm with an outpatient.

53
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,751
<i>Jun-wan just went in.</i>

54
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,128
<i>I don't think he can make it.</i>

55
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:51,342
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

56
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,707
Aren't you cold?

57
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,043
Why didn't you just wait in your office?

58
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:29,880
Go and get some sleep.

59
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,049
You need to see your patients tomorrow.

60
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,468
I can't sleep.

61
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,721
I thought about going home,
but I just can't.

62
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:39,515
Song-hwa.

63
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:46,230
I don't know how I'm feeling.

64
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,190
What do you mean?

65
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:52,194
I don't know if I'm sad

66
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:54,947
or relieved.

67
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,827
I don't know

68
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,329
how I'm supposed to feel.

69
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:03,914
They are my feelings,

70
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,380
but I can't put a finger on it.

71
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:16,301
And I don't know

72
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:20,264
what kind of a face I should put on.

73
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,022
Then, just don't do anything.

74
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,998
Guys, go home. I'm all right.

75
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:47,458
Jeez.

76
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:53,922
Will you stay here all night?

77
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:56,216
Jun-wan will be here.

78
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,178
Yes. I have to be up all night anyway
to check in on the other patients.

79
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,179
You should go home.

80
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:02,431
I'll call you if something happens.

81
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:05,392
Listen to him.

82
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,229
I swear.

83
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:12,316
I don't believe in superstitions.

84
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:17,029
But I have a bad feeling about it.
I don't think I should leave.

85
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:47,726
Perhaps,
I should wear a black suit all the time.

86
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:50,938
Goodness. There are so many funerals
to attend these days.

87
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,900
Chairman Yang had a bad heart,
to begin with, right?

88
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,028
Jeong-won told me he had angina.

89
00:05:58,112 --> 00:05:59,947
And he had gotten the surgery for it.

90
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:03,200
But he said it wasn't serious.

91
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,452
Gosh, I can't believe he died so suddenly.

92
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:07,496
If this was going to be it,

93
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,499
he should have been nice
to his wife and children.

94
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:13,961
What's going to happen to
his company, then?

95
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:18,132
Isn't he the majority shareholder
of Taegeon Apparel?

96
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:22,719
I doubt Professor Yang's mom
can run the company.

97
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:26,098
-Will Professor Yang run the company?
-How can he do that?

98
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:29,143
Jong-su.

99
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:33,105
I guess we don't live in an unfair world.

100
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:36,150
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about his mistress.

101
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:37,818
She's left with nothing now.

102
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:40,529
I'm sure she wanted
to take over the company.

103
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,575
Thank you for coming.

104
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,451
Did you eat?

105
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:49,079
Can you give them
more side dishes and drinks, please?

106
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,873
We're okay. We ate a lot.

107
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,417
Did you get some sleep?
What about your friends?

108
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,335
I took a short nap.

109
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:58,589
They all have surgery in the evening,

110
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:00,132
so they came this afternoon.

111
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:01,800
-Sir, do you want some beer?
-No.

112
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:04,052
What about your mother?

113
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:05,888
She went home just now.

114
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:09,725
I told her to sleep at home tonight
and come back tomorrow morning.

115
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:13,353
Most of his employees came
in the afternoon.

116
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,023
Only my guests are night owls.

117
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:18,192
Here come your night owls.

118
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:21,153
Jong-su, his friends are here.
We should go.

119
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:23,030
Okay. Let's go.

120
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:27,492
Bye. Hello, guys.

121
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,620
-Mom.
-Take care.

122
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:32,206
-Okay. Thanks for coming. Bye.
-Bye.

123
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,251
Your underwear and razor.

124
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:39,630
The underwear is new,
and I brought the razor from your office.

125
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:44,384
Thank you. I thought
about asking my mom to bring me some.

126
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:46,929
And this is a pain relief patch.
Put it on when you go to sleep.

127
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:49,014
When my dad passed away,

128
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,475
my knees hurt the most

129
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,227
because I had to bow a lot of times.

130
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:57,189
-You didn't eat dinner yet, right?
-I'm hungry.

131
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:59,066
-My gosh, I'm hungry.
-Give me one.

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,320
She came to the funeral? Really?

133
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:06,114
My gosh, she is one gutsy woman.

134
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:09,243
Luckily, my mom wasn't here,
so there wasn't a scene.

135
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:10,869
Did you curse and kick her out?

136
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:13,830
Don't you know Seok-hyeong?
I'm sure he sent her away quietly.

137
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,500
No, she paid her respect.

138
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:19,586
I told her to do that.

139
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:22,256
Are you insane?

140
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,216
The real Buddha was here.

141
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,134
Did she say anything else?

142
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,888
She told me that
she was six months pregnant.

143
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:31,765
Who wants to know that?

144
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:36,061
She said that the child may be fatherless
but will have a good older brother.

145
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:38,647
She kept going on about this and that.

146
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:40,816
I just listened to her.

147
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,859
She's on another level.

148
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:45,070
Well, that's how she could be
his mistress.

149
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:47,656
-Then, that lady...
-Lady? Are you mad?

150
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,244
-Then, she can't get anything, right?
-You bet.

151
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,037
When her baby is born,

152
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:56,623
the baby will have the right
to a part of the inheritance.

153
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:57,833
Will you let that happen?

154
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,253
It might be hard to prove paternity
since your father passed away.

155
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,380
Don't let them have a cent. Not a cent.

156
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:06,508
That's not up to me.

157
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:09,761
Besides, it's not the baby's fault.

158
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:11,430
-Hey!
-Hey!

159

HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

161
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:30,449
Yes.

162
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,409
Okay. I got it.

163
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:35,954
Hello. We're here to get admitted.

164
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:37,289
I see. This way.

165
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,625
-What's your name?
-It's Park Byeong-su.

166
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,670
I see. I need to ask you a few questions.

167
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:45,297
Do you have any underlying conditions?

168
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,216
-I have diabetes.
-When were you diagnosed?

169
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,010
-Was it ten years ago?
-Yes.

170
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,428
It was a long time ago.

171
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:54,181
I see.
Have you had any surgery in the past?

172
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,766
-No, this is my first one.
-I see.

173
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,101
-I'll get your height and weight.
-Okay.

174
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:01,605
The patient from Room One is about
to get surgery. Is the patient ready?

175
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:02,898
Hold on.

176
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,649
-Let me add antibiotics.
-Okay.

177
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,652
Lee Jang-u is back from his surgery.

178
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:09,154
Hold on.

179
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,742
Yes. Okay. I'll get it ready.

180
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:15,452
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

181
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:17,829
The patient in Room Eight
came back from surgery.

182
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:19,748
And a patient will be moved
from the ER to Room Three.

183
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,376
But I'm not done going over
the steps with him.

184
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,919
-Head to Room Eight, please.
-Okay.

185
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,379
Get his medical history first.

186
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:29,257
I'll check the patient in Room Eight,
Lee Jang-u's vital signs

187
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,676
-and see if a bed is ready in Room Three.
-Thank you.

188
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,095
-This way.
-Take a seat.

189
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:37,682
Ma'am, we need to get
Lee Jae-guk's consent for ERCP.

190
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:38,850
How should I explain it?

191
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,771
After his cholecystectomy,
he has a high total bilirubin level.

192
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:45,482
From the MRCP exam, we found a CBD stone,
so he's getting ERCP.

193
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,608
Okay.

194
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:50,529
So-mi, I have portrait rights.

195
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,155
Why don't you get my permission first?

196
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,867
You totally got it wrong.
I wasn't filming you.

197
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:03,583
You're going to be moved
to a regular room now.

198
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,168
Are you feeling okay?

199
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:09,923
Taking deep breaths will help you recover.

200
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:12,592
Make sure to go
to your physical therapy sessions.

201
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:14,386
And I'll see you in three months.

202
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:16,513
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

203
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:29,276
Professor Chae,
your herniated disc got worse.

204
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,444
Did you take your pills?

205
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,237
I'm thinking about taking it.

206
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,240
But taking one isn't enough now.

207
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:37,159
-Aren't we almost done?
-Yes.

208
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:38,577
-Bring in the next patient.
-Okay.

209
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:40,912
Wait.

210
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:43,415
-Yes?
<i>-Professor Chae.</i>

211
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:44,958
<i>He's in his 40s.</i>

212
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,461
<i>I see ICH in his left basal ganglia
from the CT scan.</i>

213
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,880
<i>And he's in a stupor
and his right motor skill is poor.</i>

214
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,339
Okay. I'm on my way.

215
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,926
I have an emergency patient in the ER.
I must get going.

216
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,928
Please explain it to my outpatients.

217
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:58,138
Okay.

218
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,655
This is your last year here?

219
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,867
-Yes.
-Did something happen?

220
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:24,331
Your absence will affect
the hospital a lot.

221
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,126
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:32,047
I know there aren't a lot of
pediatric surgeons at our hospital.

223
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,133
-And I won't be here.
-That's not the point.

224
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,803
There are only 48 pediatric surgeons
in Korea.

225
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,766
We are the only major hospital
with two pediatric surgeons.

226
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:46,061
And there are over ten hospitals
without a pediatric surgeon.

227
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:48,647
I'm sure you know this better than I do,

228
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:54,528
but each pediatric surgeon
means the whole staff.

229
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,449
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

230
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,787
The other pediatric surgeons
went to our branch in Sokcho,

231
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,707
and without you, Pediatric Surgery
at our hospital will have to close down.

232
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:11,419
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:15,757
Okay.

234
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,426
I'll think about it.

235
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:22,055
So can you please reconsider
your decision?

236
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:24,140
Okay.

237
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,727
Sir, open your eyes.

238
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:29,521
What's your name?

239
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,724
I'll insert a catheter
after looking at the CT navigation,

240
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:07,601
so take the CT navigation
and arrange an OR.

241
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,269
-Call me once the patient is ready.
-Okay.

242
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:14,566
A thin blood vessel in his brain
called basal ganglia

243
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,152
ruptured and began to bleed.

244
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:20,113
That's why he is unconscious,
and his right side has become weak.

245
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,616
After checking the navigation system

246
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,076
and insert the catheter
in the right spot and remove blood,

247
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,412
he may regain his consciousness.

248
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:30,165
But if his bleeding gets worse,
it might be dangerous for him.

249
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,416
Oh, no.

250
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,920
Does it mean something could
happen to him during surgery?

251
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:39,591
Yes. But if he doesn't get the surgery,

252
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:43,345
he won't be able to regain his
consciousness and die due to the bleeding.

253
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,597
Surgery is the only option he has now.

254
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:49,142
There is brain damage
the moment the bleeding starts.

255
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,394
So there will be sequelae.

256
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:54,731
But we must remove
as much blood as we can in his brain

257
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,567
to hope that
he may regain his consciousness.

258
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:01,029
For now, I'll do my best
to perform the surgery.

259
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:05,408
Doctor, please save my husband.

260
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:08,745
If you just save him, I don't care
if his arms or legs are paralyzed.

261
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:10,497
Please just save him.

262
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,124
I'll do my best.

263
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:23,885
I'm in the OR lounge.

264
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,346
Yes. I have two back-to-back surgeries.

265
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,931
I'm drinking coffee after my first one.

266
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,724
-What are you doing?
<i>-I'm shooting guns.</i>

267
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:31,810
Stop lying.

268
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:34,354
Are you looking down on me
because I didn't serve in the army?

269
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,730
<i>Officers have a firing drill.</i>

270
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:37,941
<i>We have to do it once every quarter.</i>

271
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:41,236
<i>We have to shoot a target that's 25m away
with a pistol, K5.</i>

272
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:44,114
<i>-I won first place.</i>
-Was there a prize?

273
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:47,534
<i>Gosh, do you think I'm at a festival?
What prize?</i>

274
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:54,416
<i>I'll go to Seoul this weekend, Jun-wan.</i>

275
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,419
<i>I'll sleep at my brother's house.
I miss U-ju so much.</i>

276
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,462
I see. Do you want to do that?

277
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:03,133
Then, I'll head there, too.

278
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,261
Okay.

279
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:08,680
I can come up with an excuse.

280
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:11,933
Okay.

281
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,941
<i>I'll go to Seoul this weekend, Jun-wan.</i>

282
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,944
<i>I'll sleep at my brother's house.
I miss U-ju so much.</i>

283
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,987
I see. Do you want to do that?

284
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,658
Then, I'll head there, too.

285
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:26,786
Okay.

286
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,205
I can come up with an excuse.

287
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,458
Okay.

288
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,378
Saturday?

289
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:37,964
Lunch? Okay.

290
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:39,674
What about dinner?

291
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:44,720
Right. Our lovely Universe
might go to sleep early.

292
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,809
Yes. Me, too. I love you.

293
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:54,021
My goodness. You're a nutcase!

294
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,899
Jeez. Gosh, I really want
to punch you right now.

295
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,819
-Why? Aren't I cute?
-Oh, my.

296
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:01,654
"I love you."

297
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:05,491
You're dating her quite long this time.
She must be a catch.

298
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,996
Yes.

299
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:14,375
That serious look on your face
doesn't suit you. Please don't do that.

300
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,632
FORMER MICKEY, CURRENTLY IK-SUN

301
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,219
Salute! What's up, Ik-sun?

302
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,763
I'm doing a liver transplant.
I'm on my break now.

303
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:32,393
Today? You're coming today?

304
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:36,647
I'd love it if you can sleepover.
My gosh, U-ju will be so thrilled.

305
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:40,234
What? What did you say?
What do you want to eat?

306
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:41,819
Snow crabs?

307
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:46,157
What are you doing?
How can I find snow crabs now?

308
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,745
What is this?

309
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,331
Can't you see? It's me.
And this is a box of snow crabs.

310
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:55,666
Why snow crabs all of a sudden?

311
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:59,128
U-ju, don't you love snow crabs?

312
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,005
I bought huge snow crabs.

313
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:04,008
-I love snow crabs?
-U-ju, thank him.

314
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:05,384
Thank you.

315
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,136
Thank you.

316
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,443
What? There is no water in your house?

317
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,362
Yes, it stopped all of a sudden.

318
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,323
But you just renovated your bathroom.

319
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,909
The construction was done poorly.
They are so awful.

320
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,329
How did you get your hair done
so neatly without the water?

321
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,664
Do I look neat? Me?

322
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,207
Not really. I just woke up.

323
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:45,508
So you're going to the hospital later?
Why? Are you also on call?

324
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,887
I have a symposium presentation
next month. So I must prepare for it.

325
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,514
And you guys are here anyway.

326
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,141
I'll go and study in a quiet place.
It's been a while.

327
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:56,310
-So you do study.
-Yes, sometimes.

328
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:57,478
You're so annoying.

329
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:00,147
-Where's the symposium?
-Spain. I have a bit more than a month.

330
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:03,693
U-ju, have fun with Aunt Ik-sun
and Uncle Snow Crab today.

331
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,736
I'll be at the hospital later, okay?

332
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,911
Dad, the snow crab is hurt.

333
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,580
What if its leg hurts a lot?

334
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,961
U-ju, can you close
your eyes for a second?

335
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,423
U-ju, look at me.

336
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,177
If you bend your joints correctly,
it doesn't hurt at all.

337
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:34,348
It just sounds loud,
but it doesn't hurt at all.

338
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:39,562
Whatever it is, if you bend it
the right way, it doesn't hurt.

339
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:44,483
U-ju, never copy your aunt, okay?

340
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,736
She's the Terminator,
so she can't feel any pain.

341
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,446
She's not a human. Stop it.

342
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:53,617
All right. Let's finish eating.

343
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,380
Hey, I'm leaving.
When U-ju wakes up, read him a book.

344
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:08,424
There's a book he likes
on his desk in his room.

345
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,967
-Okay.
-When are you coming back?

346
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,595
-I'll be back soon.
-Take your time.

347
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,515
You haven't had time for yourself lately.

348
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,434
Enjoy your alone time.

349
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:22,229
He's right. You can take your time.
We'll watch U-ju.

350
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,106
Okay. Gosh.

351
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,403
By the way, you two...

352
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,161
Don't fight.

353
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:40,664
-We won't fight. Why would we?
-No. Why would we?

354
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:41,874
My goodness.

355
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,626
Bye.

356
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:01,227
Leave them. I'll do it.
I'm good at washing dishes.

357
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,561
I'm almost done.

358
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,023
Give me a kiss.

359
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,494
U-ju.

360
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,455
Sleep in your room.

361
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:39,765
If U-ju gets hungry after he wakes up,

362
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:42,351
there's chocolate milk in the fridge.
Give him that.

363
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,686
And once he wakes up, call me.

364
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,355
Are you turning into Jeong-won?

365
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:47,857
That's enough.

366
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,609
Why are you wiping only one spot?

367
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:06,542
My brother changed a lot.
He became a new man after he got married.

368
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,502
Ik-jun changed a lot.

369
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,755
Yes. My brother went clubbing all the time

370
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,757
and went around the town like a dog.

371
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:17,761
So I thought he might freeze to death
on the street or would be beaten to death.

372
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:22,391
But when he became a father
after getting married,

373
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,226
he totally changed.

374
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,980
He stopped going clubbing
and playing games.

375
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,690
You know that he's good at poker, right?

376
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:30,816
Of course.

377
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33,527
He used to play hard, but now,

378
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:36,322
I guess he gave up on having his own life.

379
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:38,657
He used to go out all the time,

380
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:41,368
but now, he lives only for his son.

381
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:45,956
It makes me sad and breaks my heart
when I see him.

382
00:22:46,957 --> 00:22:48,751
That means he loves U-ju so much.

383
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,504
I think I would do the same
if I get married and have a family.

384
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:56,383
That's a huge blessing, too.

385
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,267
Yes, I just arrived at the hospital.

386
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,854
<i>How could you leave
right after finishing your birthday meal?</i>

387
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,481
<i>You're breaking our hearts.</i>

388
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,567
I'm sorry. I have a lot of work to do.

389
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,696
Okay. I'll call you often.

390
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,616
Thank you for giving birth to me.

391
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:23,327
Okay.

392
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,625
Why are you here? It's the weekend.

393
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:33,003
Hello. You're working hard.

394
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,761
Chi-hong is my friend and all,
but I respect him a lot.

395
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,680
He's diligent and thoughtful.

396
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:45,224
Everyone in the military academy thought

397
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:48,602
that he would become a general
because he's born to be in the military.

398
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:51,730
-I knew. I can tell he's diligent.
-Yes.

399
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,775
He always woke up at 5 a.m.
when he was in the military academy

400
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:56,318
to exercise by himself for an hour.

401
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:59,738
He even studied and read books.
He worked really hard to improve himself.

402
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:04,284
And when we heard that he was sick
and getting discharged all of a sudden,

403
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,664
a lot of us cried.
Chi-hong cried his eyes out, too.

404
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,209
Gosh, that was so awful.

405
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,419
It worked out well, though.

406
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:15,629
He'll take the medical board exam
after a year.

407
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:17,881
He must do a fellowship for a few years,

408
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:19,717
but he's almost at the finish line.

409
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,552
He just needs to work
his ass off for a year.

410
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:23,220
Right, it worked well.

411
00:24:23,554 --> 00:24:24,805
I was so worried

412
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:27,599
when I heard he was going to med school
and apply for neurosurgery.

413
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,601
There are so many weirdos at hospitals.

414
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:34,440
I knew he wouldn't give up
because he's tough.

415
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:37,985
But I was worried that he might meet
an awful professor and have a hard time.

416
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:39,820
Everyone was worried.

417
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:44,074
Luckily, he met a great professor at Yulje
and adjusted well.

418
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:45,784
You don't know how relieved I am.

419
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:47,661
He has Chae Song-hwa.

420
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,289
His professor is my friend, Chae Song-hwa.

421
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,791
I also matured
because I had her as my friend.

422
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,086
Seriously. It's all thanks to Song-hwa.

423
00:24:56,754 --> 00:25:00,758
She's a really good person.
Just the sight of her makes me happy.

424
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,264
Ik-jun should have tried to date her.
He's such a fool.

425
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:10,642
Are you sure there's nothing between them?

426
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:12,977
Nothing. There's nothing between them.

427
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,650
You came to check on the drainage
of the patient from yesterday?

428
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,027
Yes, it's an ICH patient.

429
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,154
We inserted a catheter
with the navigation system.

430
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:25,783
The surgery went well,
but the drainage isn't that high.

431
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:27,993
So Professor Chae is very worried.

432
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,163
And I need to take care
of some charts, too.

433
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:33,373
So I decided to check on the patient
while I'm at it.

434
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,460
People like you should be doctors.

435
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,671
I think I would sleep all day
if I had the weekend off.

436
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,131
I slept a lot before coming in.

437
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,342
-How many hours?
-Five hours.

438
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,887
You're so lucky
that you don't need to sleep a lot.

439
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,557
My body is used to it. I'd been doing it
since the military academy.

440
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,476
You're not going to move?

441
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:55,437
Stop sleeping in the on-call room
because you live far.

442
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,064
Get a studio in front of the hospital.

443
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,317
You'll be busier once you become a chief.
Until when will you sleep in that room?

444
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,195
Actually, I'm considering that option.

445
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:11,120
Seventh floor, neurosurgery, right?

446
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,288
Yes. Thank you.

447
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:20,963
Fourth floor, pediatric ward?

448
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,340
How did you know?

449
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:25,843
I have superpowers.

450
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,931
You didn't go camping?

451
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:16,351
Why are you here, Professor Chae?

452
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,896
I should ask you the same thing.
You're not on-call today.

453
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:20,689
I had some work left to do.

454
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,357
Are you here to check on Im Jang-hun?

455
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,734
Yes.

456
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,069
I can't seem to leave.

457
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,783
What about dinner?
Let's have dinner together.

458
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:35,871
I don't want to.
Not when it's just the two of us.

459
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:37,915
Why not? Is it uncomfortable for you?

460
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,211
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

461
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,839
But I just don't want you
to make the mood awkward again.

462
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,217
I won't do that.

463
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:50,510
I promise.

464
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,432
Fine. Let's get dinner together.
The elevator is here.

465
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:05,192
FORMER MICKY, CURRENTLY IK-SUN

466
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:09,655
-Go ahead.
-<i>Dad.</i>

467
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:10,864
Are you up, U-ju?

468
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:13,700
<i>Ik-jun, he must have had a nightmare.
He keeps crying.</i>

469
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:17,120
Seriously. Why did you pop your joints
in front of him? My gosh.

470
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:19,122
-I'm on my way now.
<i>-My dove trick isn't working.</i>

471
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:20,958
<i>I flew about a dozen, but he keeps crying.</i>

472
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,251
Your dove trick?

473
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,003
Stop. I don't want you to do anything.

474
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:26,588
There's a convenience store nearby.

475
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,507
The store sells the ice cream he likes.

476
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,884
Try to calm him down with that.
I'm leaving now.

477
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:32,636
Okay.

478
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:44,648
-First Basement floor.
-Okay.

479
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:56,243
Professor Chae, do you remember that day?

480
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,869
When?

481
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,414
My first day here as an intern.

482
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:03,250
I saw you on my way to work
on my first day.

483
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,210
Really? Where?

484
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,173
-Hello.
-Hi.

485
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,927
Weren't you going camping? What happened?

486
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:15,804
I couldn't go.

487
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:17,681
Why are you here?

488
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:19,766
To work on my paper
for the symposium next month.

489
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:21,518
Where are you two going?

490
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:24,563
-To have dinner.
-I see.

491
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,773
Did you have dinner?

492
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:28,525
I'll eat dinner at home. U-ju is waiting.

493
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:30,110
I see. Okay.

494
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,998
-I parked my car on the first floor. Bye.
-Okay.

495
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,384
Don't you have a lot to take care of?

496
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:58,347
-Not really.
-We really only have a month left.

497
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:03,894
I had no idea that I would be
in a long-distance relationship at my age.

498
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:06,313
I'm sorry.

499
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:10,192
Don't be sorry. It's all right.
It's a great opportunity for you.

500
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,905
Jun-wan, you'll be 43 in 3 years.

501
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:18,241
Being 40 or 43 aren't that different.

502
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,206
The time difference is eight hours,
so it'll be hard to call each other.

503
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:28,460
Then, we would misunderstand
each other and fight, right?

504
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:31,546
Right. We'll misunderstand
each other and fight.

505
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,673
We'll fight about who comes to where.

506
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:36,843
"Why are you leaving so quickly?
Why aren't you answering my calls?

507
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,472
It was on vibrate."
And we'll argue like crazy.

508
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,977
And we'll break up, then.

509
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:55,654
You didn't even leave yet.

510
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:59,074
Why are you worried about
something that hasn't happened yet?

511
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,036
Because you want
to get married and have children.

512
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:05,288
What if you waste your three years on me?

513
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:06,373
I really hate that.

514
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:08,750
No.

515
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:12,546
If you want, we can continue this
for five or ten years.

516
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:13,922
I'm okay with everything.

517
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:17,717
What I want isn't getting married.

518
00:31:18,802 --> 00:31:20,595
It's to be with you for a long time.

519
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:23,390
Of course, I want to marry you.

520
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:26,268
But if you don't want it, we won't.

521
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:29,729
I'm already so happy with you.

522
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,194
Ik-sun.

523
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:39,865
Three years will go by fast.

524
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:42,492
Forty years went by fast, too.

525
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,835
Give me your hand.
I have something to give you.

526
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:54,254
Don't do it.

527
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,674
I clearly told you that's not what I want.

528
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,135
When we first started dating,

529
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,972
I made myself clear that
you shouldn't do anything for me.

530
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:06,892
I said I hate presents
like rings and necklaces.

531
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,730
Who said I had a ring or necklace?

532
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:24,618
-I bet you're embarrassed.
-Give me that.

533
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:27,621
If you tell me not to do something,
I'll never do it.

534
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:29,748
I'm a kind boyfriend.

535
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:32,959
Can you hear it?

536
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,920
It's not playing.

537
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:38,882
It's playing now.

538
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,676
This is nice.

539
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:47,140
I love this song, Jun-wan.

540
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,142
What was the title?

541
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,062
-"ER."
-No.

542
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:54,481
Yes, it is. "Emergency Room."

543
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:57,317
It's the song
hospital employees hate the most.

544
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,403
Why do they hate it? I love it.

545
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,910
This is the perfect song for the weather.

546
00:33:07,661 --> 00:33:08,995
This is great.

547
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:25,887
It's the weekend.
Are you sleeping at the hospital?

548
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:27,973
I can drop you off at your house.

549
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,016
It's okay.
I feel more comfortable sleeping there.

550
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,977
You should get a place
close to the hospital.

551
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,895
Getting a good rest is necessary, too.

552
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,855
Okay.

553
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:38,233
GOOFBALL IK-JUN

554
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,946
I'm driving.

555
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:44,990
Chi-hong is with me.
You're on speakerphone.

556
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:46,616
Hang up if you want to goof around.

557
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,244
<i>Are you giving Dr. Ahn a ride?</i>

558
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,162
Yes, what is it? What's up?

559
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,706
<i>I was wondering what you were up to.</i>

560
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:56,042
<i>Okay. Drive safely. Let's talk later.</i>

561
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:57,168
Okay.

562
00:34:14,394 --> 00:34:15,812
Have a goodnight. I'll see you on Monday.

563
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,523
Okay. Thank you.

564
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,529
-Professor Chae.
-Yes?

565
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:26,906
It's my birthday today.

566
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,743
Really? Why did you tell me that now?

567
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:31,453
Do you need anything?

568
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:34,497
Hey, did you come to the hospital
on your birthday?

569
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:36,875
What's wrong with you?

570
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,003
-Don't you have friends?
-I have a lot of friends.

571
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:43,715
I had a birthday party
with my friends yesterday.

572
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,468
I had dinner with the people
from the hospital yesterday.

573
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:50,597
I couldn't tell you
because your surgery ended late.

574
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:54,392
Your birthday isn't over yet.
Is there anything you want?

575
00:34:54,476 --> 00:34:55,852
I'll buy it. Just tell me.

576
00:34:58,271 --> 00:34:59,939
There's a present I want.

577
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:01,441
What is it?

578
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,904
Can I speak to you casually just once?

579
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:17,123
I won't cross the line.

580
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,334
Go ahead.

581
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,305
Drive safely.

582
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:43,149
See you at work on Monday.

583
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,720
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

584
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:15,140
Is Seok-hyeong coming back today?

585
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,059
Tomorrow. He'll call
once he arrives in Seoul tonight.

586
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,438
He should rest up
in Jeju Island a bit more.

587
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:23,064
Isn't he coming back so soon?

588
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,942
He was off for over a week.
It's about time he comes back to work.

589
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:27,318
Where's Ik-jun? I'm hungry.

590
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:29,612
I'm right here.

591
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:31,448
-What is it?
-What is it?

592
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:32,991
Pork belly.

593
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,243
-No way!
-No way!

594
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,262
Should we call them in now?

595
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,347
Hey.

596
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,558
Hold on.

597
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,773
This is so good.

598
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,907
-Call them in now.
-Now? Wait.

599
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:16,409
Okay.

600
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:32,217
Did you know that this was grilled kimchi?

601
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:34,552
There was grilled kimchi? Give me that.

602
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:40,558
Hey, try the meat
with the pickled Siberian onion leaf.

603
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:42,644
It tastes totally different.

604
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:49,734
Seriously.
They are a fantastic duo of eaters.

605
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:52,195
They are so adorable.

606
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:54,239
Stay friends for long.
Just don't marry each other,

607
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,074
-but have meals together.
-Exactly.

608
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:59,369
How can they watch each other eat
every meal like this as husband and wife?

609
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:00,620
Did you taste the kimchi?

610
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:02,956
It's really good.

611
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:13,007
-Yes?
-<i>Professor Ahn, the patient went under.</i>

612
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,343
Okay. Get it ready.

613
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:17,303
Okay.

614
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,890
Is that emergency surgery?
I thought you didn't have surgery today.

615
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:23,893
Well, I do. It's a urachal cyst excision,
and the patient is a seven-year-old child.

616
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:26,020
I think it was Gyeo-ul on the phone.

617
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,189
Yes, it was. She's the surgeon today.

618
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,484
She is? Does it mean
this is Gyeo-ul's first solo surgery?

619
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,196
If you don't want it, I will.

620
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:38,700
-Just eat the meat. Eat the meat!
-No.

621
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,286
I want to eat it with rice.

622
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,610
You will lead the surgery today, Dr. Jang.

623
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:15,528
I'll assist.

624
00:39:16,362 --> 00:39:18,823
Congratulations, Dr. Jang.
It's your first surgery.

625
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:21,534
He doesn't let other doctors
lead pediatric surgeries.

626
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:23,578
So you should do really well today.

627
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:26,956
Thank you, Professor Ahn.

628
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,833
Sure.

629
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,129
I'll begin.

630
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:54,484
Pass me the tissue forceps.

631
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:05,536
You should peel off
the right side a bit more.

632
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,206
Okay.
I will ligate the blood vessel first.

633
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,000
-Okay. Sounds great.
-Mixter, please.

634
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,048
ELAPSED TIME

635
00:40:21,177 --> 00:40:23,471
Is the structure I'm seeing the cyst?

636
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:27,141
Yes, it is. You need to remove it.

637
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,227
But you have to hold
the top and bottom tracks.

638
00:40:29,811 --> 00:40:32,730
Okay. Right-angle forceps, please.

639
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,779
-I'll ligate it.
-Okay. Looking good.

640
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:41,990
-Mosquito forceps, please.
-One more pair, please.

641
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,575
Metzenbaum scissors, please.

642
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,502
-You did well.
-Thank you.

643
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:57,422
-Ligate closely on the blood vessel.
-Okay.

644
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:58,756
RESTRICTED AREA

645
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:06,389
When did he tell you that?

646
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:08,391
He told me a while ago.

647
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:10,518
I wasn't sure if telling you

648
00:41:10,977 --> 00:41:13,396
was the right thing to do
since it's about the hospital.

649
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:15,398
That's why I didn't tell you earlier.

650
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,693
But

651
00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:22,280
did something happen to him?

652
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,491
Jong-su, where's the smoking room?

653
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,786
Let's go out.

654
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:34,042
You have liver cirrhosis.

655
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:38,379
And we found a cancerous tumor
as big as 4cm.

656
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:41,132
In cases like this,

657
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:44,469
having liver transplant
is the best way to cure cancer.

658
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,888
Let's get you on the transplant list.

659
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,308
But cancer might progress
as you wait for a donor.

660
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:54,562
So as of now,
the best and the quickest way is

661
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,314
a living-donor liver transplant.

662
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:58,524
A living-donor liver transplant?

663
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:01,694
I don't want that, doctor.

664
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:04,947
I don't want to burden my family.

665
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:06,783
Chang-hak, what are you talking about?

666
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:09,744
You're not burdening us. Don't say that.
We're family.

667
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,039
Right, Chang-hak.
We'll talk about this together.

668
00:42:13,122 --> 00:42:14,832
You don't have to worry, okay?

669
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:22,215
Professor Lee, if he's going on the list,
there are a few more things to check.

670
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:24,050
He should get the tests now.

671
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:25,259
Okay.

672
00:42:40,233 --> 00:42:41,234
Sweetie,

673
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:44,529
why don't you donate
a piece of your liver?

674
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:52,286
You're still young.

675
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,082
It's only right that you do it.

676
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:01,170
Right. You are his wife after all.

677
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:05,049
Okay.

678
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:07,385
That's right. You must save your husband.

679
00:43:08,678 --> 00:43:11,222
You need to save your husband first.
That comes first. Okay?

680
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:15,351
I'm sorry. We're pretty old.

681
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,188
Well, he's Chang-hak's brother,
but he's been weak since birth.

682
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:22,733
I think you might be his best chance.

683
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:26,654
Okay.

684
00:43:30,032 --> 00:43:31,617
I will do it, doctor.

685
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:36,455
Then, when can she get the test done?

686
00:43:37,623 --> 00:43:40,793
The faster she gets the test,
the faster he will get the surgery.

687
00:43:41,169 --> 00:43:43,713
Schedule the test
as soon as possible, doctor.

688
00:43:44,213 --> 00:43:46,757
Okay. Once the donor is decided,

689
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,343
I'll schedule the test
as soon as possible.

690
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,262
To proceed with his tests,

691
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:54,140
could you go to the first floor
and settle the medical bill first?

692
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:55,933
Okay.

693
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:00,062
Your son seemed in pretty bad condition.

694
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:02,982
I think it's better that someone stays
with him during the tests.

695
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:05,026
-Okay.
-Okay.

696
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,711
Donating a piece of your organ
is risking your life.

697
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:25,963
I understand
it may be difficult to decide.

698
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:31,469
And I know that it becomes harder
when you have a family to take care of.

699
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,682
No one can criticize you
for not saying yes.

700
00:44:39,227 --> 00:44:42,396
If you don't want to do it,
be honest with me and just tell me.

701
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:45,650
I can tell them that it won't happen.

702
00:44:46,776 --> 00:44:48,069
Doctor.

703
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:52,281
I will take the test.

704
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:57,161
And when you get the test result,

705
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:04,293
please tell them that I wasn't a match.

706
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:10,967
I'm sorry.

707
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,720
I'm really sorry.

708
00:45:16,138 --> 00:45:19,809
There's nothing for you
to be sorry about. I'll talk to them.

709
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:22,853
I'm sorry.

710
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:36,826
Rosa.

711
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:40,705
It won't be easy to get
Jeong-won to change his mind.

712
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:42,915
I know that, too.

713
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,626
Stop putting him through this pain.

714
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,129
Why don't you let him do
what his heart wants to do?

715
00:45:54,343 --> 00:45:56,262
You can hang out with me.

716
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,348
What is it? You don't want that?

717
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:01,642
Where's the center garden?

718
00:46:03,102 --> 00:46:05,563
-Why?
-I was supposed to meet him there.

719
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,648
He's done with surgery.
He wants to meet there.

720
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,276
Okay. I'll take you.
It's right around the corner.

721
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:25,875
My goodness.

722
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:29,879
Gosh.

723
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:34,133
He's a grown man. What can you do?

724
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,218
He won't listen to us now.

725
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:40,097
Forget it. Just give up, okay?

726
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:47,938
Let's go.

727
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:03,371
-Hey. There he is.
-I was talking to you.

728
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:09,919
Hold on. Wait, Jong-su.

729
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:11,670
What is it?

730
00:47:14,715 --> 00:47:17,134
Professor Ahn, my incision
wasn't too long, right?

731
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:19,011
No, it was pretty good.

732
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:21,430
My sutures were pretty good, right?

733
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:24,183
You did well.

734
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:27,061
It was your first time, but you finished
in 30 minutes. That's good.

735
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,437
The patient will recover, right?

736
00:47:30,022 --> 00:47:32,066
I'm moving the patient to the ward.
Come with me.

737
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:35,361
-Pay attention when dressing tomorrow.
-Okay.

738
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:43,577
Okay.

739
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:12,606
Jong-su.

740
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:14,567
I have an idea.

741
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:17,528
-What idea?
-It's my last idea

742
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:21,699
that will make Jeong-won live
as my son, not a priest.

743
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:25,327
It's hit-or-miss.

744
00:48:25,828 --> 00:48:27,746
But I ought to give it a try.

745
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,248
Try what?

746
00:48:29,832 --> 00:48:31,667
Let's go. I'm craving <i>jjamppong</i>.

747
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:35,296
-What about Jeong-won?
-I won't see him. Come with me.

748
00:48:50,352 --> 00:48:51,520
Her name is Chae-yun.

749
00:48:53,314 --> 00:48:56,650
She had a microembolism in her brain
last week, so things don't look good.

750
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,028
And Professor Kim is troubled
because of that.

751
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,740
"Microembolism"? Is it a small clot?

752
00:49:03,782 --> 00:49:05,659
You have to apply for CS.

753
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:08,496
Yes, that's it.

754
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,417
But as for Chae-yun, she has HLHS,
Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.

755
00:49:13,501 --> 00:49:14,960
She was diagnosed before birth,

756
00:49:15,377 --> 00:49:17,922
and was born prematurely at 34 weeks
and weighed 1.6kg.

757
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:20,341
The left side of her heart
hasn't formed at all.

758
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:23,969
To help her live with what she has,
she needs several surgeries.

759
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,804
So far, she had two surgeries after birth,

760
00:49:25,888 --> 00:49:27,765
and was discharged 100 days after birth.

761
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:32,520
And she was scheduled for another surgery
six months after birth.

762
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:34,146
But

763
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:38,317
two months ago, her condition got worse,
so she was admitted to the ER.

764
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:42,738
And now, she's been
on ECMO for two months.

765
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:46,325
So now, the only option
she has is a transplant.

766
00:49:46,825 --> 00:49:48,619
You can't find any donors for her?

767
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:51,205
It's very hard to find a donor
for a heart transplant for a baby.

768
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:52,748
Less than three heart transplants

769
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:55,584
are done for babies in a year
all over the country.

770
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:58,003
Dr. Do, tell Chae-yun's mom
that I'd like to speak with her.

771
00:49:58,087 --> 00:49:59,171
Sure.

772
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,014
The paralysis of the arms
caused by microembolism

773
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:11,684
has gotten better
since we gave her an anticoagulant.

774
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:15,854
But to tell you the truth,
the situation isn't looking good.

775
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:22,152
I'm not sure
if it's okay for me to say this,

776
00:50:23,279 --> 00:50:26,448
but I really hope we can find
a donor soon. At the moment,

777
00:50:27,575 --> 00:50:28,993
that is the only way.

778
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:30,077
Doctor.

779
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,788
Chae-yun was born only seven months ago,

780
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:36,333
but she's spent five months
in the hospital.

781
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:39,503
There have been many emergencies,

782
00:50:39,587 --> 00:50:42,548
but she's made it through all of them
thanks to you.

783
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:43,799
She's

784
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,636
breathing and moving.

785
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,597
She's still alive.

786
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,434
Doctor, I know that Chae-yun will live.

787
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:55,185
We will find a donor,

788
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,314
and she'll be able to undergo the surgery.

789
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:02,693
So please don't give up on Chae-yun.

790
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,489
Of course, I will never give up on her.

791
00:51:07,615 --> 00:51:10,367
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

792
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:12,119
Thank you.

793
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:14,872
Thank you.

794
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:23,380
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

795
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:32,640
Professor Yang.

796
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:34,808
Professor Yang.

797
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,061
Professor Yang.

798
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:41,690
Professor Yang, have you eaten yet?

799
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:49,281
Professor Yang, have you eaten yet?

800
00:51:49,698 --> 00:51:51,325
How's your mother?

801
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:54,870
Did you have dinner?
Would you like to have dinner with me?

802
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,082
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but he's having dinner with us.

803
00:51:58,874 --> 00:52:01,627
Oh, hello! Bye!

804
00:52:02,127 --> 00:52:04,463
Where am I going? Bye!

805
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:07,466
Gosh, I'm screwed!

806
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,890
You came earlier than I thought.

807
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:17,518
I have a lot of outpatients tomorrow,
so I went through the charts.

808
00:52:18,018 --> 00:52:20,270
-Where's Song-hwa?
-At Neurosurgery's team dinner.

809
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:21,563
She'll join us later.

810
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:24,692
-What about Ik-jun?
-At Neurosurgery's team dinner.

811
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,736
Ik-jun sure loves to party.

812
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:33,075
-Hey, gosh.
-You're a lightweight.

813
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:34,743
You look so worried.

814
00:52:34,827 --> 00:52:36,453
Are you sure you'll be okay?

815
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:39,123
People still play this game?

816
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:41,083
I haven't played this for 20 years.

817
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,127
They're young,
so they're curious about each other.

818
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,294
I think it's cute.

819
00:52:44,753 --> 00:52:46,922
Why can't they just ask these questions
via text message?

820
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:50,134
Be quiet. Just be grateful
that they let us join them.

821
00:52:50,217 --> 00:52:51,468
Spin it.

822
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,178
Good.

823
00:52:57,433 --> 00:52:58,726
-My gosh.
-Yes!

824
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:01,019
Yes!

825
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:03,897
Well... You guys don't have
any questions for me, right?

826
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,108
-All right, pass.
-Doctor.

827
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:10,529
What do you think of Dr. Heo Seon-bin?

828
00:53:10,612 --> 00:53:13,198
Hey, I told you
that nothing's going on between us.

829
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:14,783
How many times do I have to tell you?

830
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:16,326
Hey, be quiet.

831
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,954
Just drink it
if you don't want to answer the question.

832
00:53:21,373 --> 00:53:22,374
Jeez.

833
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,584
Wait.

834
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:30,340
Now, you'll hear his answer.

835
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:32,843
Gosh, don't you know the drill?
Come on, guys.

836
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:36,138
Seok-min, answer the question.

837
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:40,267
What do you think?

838
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,810
I think she's a great colleague.

839
00:53:41,894 --> 00:53:43,604
-Come on.
-Come on.

840
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,273
-There, I answered.
-Guys, you asked the wrong question.

841
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,525
Of course, he'd give an answer like that.

842
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:50,986
You guys don't really know
how to play this game. Get with it.

843
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:53,781
-How should they have worded it?
-Do you like Heo Seon-bin?

844
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:58,660
Seok-min, answer the question.

845
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,539
Gosh, I thought
you were just demonstrating.

846
00:54:02,623 --> 00:54:04,291
See that? He got all worked up.

847
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,919
That's the reaction you're after. Got it?

848
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:08,462
Ask questions like that from now on.

849
00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:11,006
What are you teaching them?

850
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:26,897
Me?

851
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:33,278
Ask me anything you want to know.
I'll tell you everything.

852
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,115
What is your relationship
with Professor Chae?

853
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:41,186
What is your relationship
with Professor Chae?

854
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,688
Oh, let me rephrase my question.

855
00:54:42,771 --> 00:54:45,274
-Hey.
-I'm sorry, Professor Chae.

856
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:46,191
Professor Lee.

857
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:50,445
Has there been a moment
when you considered

858
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:53,949
Professor Chae
to be more than just your friend?

859
00:54:54,032 --> 00:54:55,576
-Nice one.
-Great question!

860
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,452
Seon-bin, you're such a fast learner.

861
00:54:57,536 --> 00:54:59,329
You're actually curious about that?

862
00:54:59,413 --> 00:55:00,289
-Yes.
-Yes, totally.

863
00:55:00,372 --> 00:55:02,207
Big-time. We're so curious.

864
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,460
We're really just friends.

865
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:07,713
We heard you,
but we're playing this game now.

866
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:11,717
Well...

867
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:14,803
Come on.
You said you'd tell us everything.

868
00:55:15,262 --> 00:55:16,930
Well...

869
00:55:32,487 --> 00:55:33,947
No comment.

870
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,408
No comment?
You practically said yes by doing that.

871
00:55:36,491 --> 00:55:38,327
What? Hey.

872
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,454
Seon-bin, how dare you talk to me
as if I'm a friend?

873
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,414
I'm a professor. How could you...

874
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:47,669
Gosh, didn't I totally sound like
an old geezer just now?

875
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,757
Sorry, guys. I regret saying that.

876
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,926
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm really sorry.

877
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:57,012
I really mean it. Okay, let's move on!

878
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,521
Me, again? Gosh.

879
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:11,777
Jeez, I guess it's my lucky day.

880
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,070
I keep getting picked.

881
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:15,656
I'm going to buy a ton of lottery tickets
on my way home.

882
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:18,700
-Professor Lee.
-Jeez, you again?

883
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:20,744
Your first love.

884
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,038
Who and when was it?

885
00:56:31,672 --> 00:56:32,631
Gosh.

886
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,054
What's happening here?

887
00:56:39,972 --> 00:56:40,973
Hey.

888
00:56:42,557 --> 00:56:43,642
Coming to his rescue?

889
00:56:43,725 --> 00:56:46,144
Gosh, why would you do that for a guy?

890
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:49,273
I can tell you my wish now that
I've downed that whole thing, right?

891
00:56:49,356 --> 00:56:50,649
Sure.

892
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:52,109
Okay.

893
00:56:53,568 --> 00:56:55,946
Please answer the question
we asked you earlier.

894
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:04,579
You've had feelings
for Professor Chae, right?

895
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:19,469
Yes, I have.

896
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:25,142
Of course, I have.

897
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:31,315
You were that curious about it?

898
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:35,235
My gosh.

899
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,800
Are you guys still together?

900
00:57:58,884 --> 00:58:00,385
<i>We're at a karaoke bar!</i>

901
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:01,720
<i>Come join us.</i>

902
00:58:01,803 --> 00:58:03,347
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>

903
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,348
Karaoke bar? Forget it.

904
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:06,099
-Ik-jun is drunk.
-<i>Tell them to hurry!</i>

905
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:07,351
No.

906
00:58:07,434 --> 00:58:09,061
-I'm not drunk.
-<i>Hurry up!</i>

907
00:58:09,144 --> 00:58:10,896
-I'm a skunk.
-<i>Come here now!</i>

908
00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:13,440
<i>Hey, we're all hammered here.</i>

909
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,567
<i>Gosh, Seok-hyeong
has been drinking all night.</i>

910
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,569
<i>-Quiet down!
-Tell this guy to shut up.</i>

911
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:19,821
<i>Anyway, stop by
even for just a few minutes.</i>

912
00:58:19,905 --> 00:58:21,740
<i>When will they get here?</i>

913
00:59:03,782 --> 00:59:04,741
Number three!

914
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:07,035
Here they are.

915
00:59:23,135 --> 00:59:24,386
-Time to go home.
-What?

916
00:59:25,053 --> 00:59:26,888
-When did you get here?
-Go home.

917
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:28,432
-Hey.
-Go home, guys!

918
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:30,350
Hey, we only have a minute left.
The last song.

919
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:31,935
I must sing the last song of the night.

920
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:33,979
Where is "Goodbye Now"?

921
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:36,106
You just sang.

922
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:37,357
-Get some rest.
-<i>One, five,</i>

923
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,152
-Why? Come on.
-<i>eight, five, four.</i>

924
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,488
"I KNEW I'D LOVE YOU"

925
00:59:58,837 --> 01:00:04,384
<i>The day I first saw the picture of you</i>

926
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:09,931
<i>January 31, 1999</i>

927
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:16,062
-<i>From that day until this moment</i>
-Is Ik-jun going through something?

928
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:19,274
<i>You waited</i>

929
01:00:19,357 --> 01:00:20,484
Something's up with him.

930
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:22,319
<i>Only for me</i>

931
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:23,612
What's going on?

932
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:31,703
<i>I called you today, out of habit</i>

933
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:37,918
<i>And you answered
In your warm, welcoming voice</i>

934
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:43,965
<i>You made me the happiest person</i>

935
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:48,303
<i>In the whole wide world</i>

936
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:52,933
<i>I love you so much</i>

937
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:57,854
<i>I knew I'd love you</i>

938
01:01:00,607 --> 01:01:04,069
<i>The day we first met</i>

939
01:01:07,405 --> 01:01:13,286
<i>Even if you falter</i>

940
01:01:14,246 --> 01:01:18,333
<i>As our love fades with time</i>

941
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:25,715
<i>I will be your anchor
Just like you were to me</i>

942
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:31,096
APRIL 1999

943
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:34,057
What about this one?

944
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:37,811
Well, I'd prefer something simple.

945
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,730
Oh, I think this one will look better.

946
01:01:40,939 --> 01:01:42,023
-The one at the front?
-Yes.

947
01:01:42,107 --> 01:01:43,650
Just a second, please.

948
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,903
My girlfriend is very neat and cute.

949
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:53,159
<i>I was mean to you</i>

950
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:58,373
<i>But you still waited for me</i>

951
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,919
<i>I knew I'd love you</i>

952
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:09,926
<i>The day we first met</i>

953
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:18,727
<i>Even if you falter</i>

954
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:23,732
<i>As our love fades with time</i>

955
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:30,864
<i>I will be your anchor
Just like you were to me</i>

956
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,241
Seriously?

957
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:35,702
From Hawaii? That's nuts.

958
01:02:36,911 --> 01:02:38,663
I must've been out of my mind.

959
01:02:38,913 --> 01:02:41,291
Anyway, you and Jeong-won
are the only ones who know about it.

960
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:43,543
Don't tell anyone.

961
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:46,379
Especially your brother. Do not tell him.

962
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:50,050
-My brother is very discreet.
-I know.

963
01:02:51,176 --> 01:02:52,761
But he'll tease me nonstop.

964
01:02:52,844 --> 01:02:54,679
He certainly has a knack
for teasing others.

965
01:02:58,266 --> 01:02:59,434
What about you?

966
01:03:02,103 --> 01:03:05,023
Me? I don't really want to talk about it.

967
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:12,530
But I should tell you because we said
we won't keep anything from each other.

968
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:19,663
I can't believe
you dated such a douchebag.

969
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:27,045
Don't worry. I'll never lie to you.

970
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:29,172
That will never happen.

971
01:03:33,718 --> 01:03:35,220
You see, Jun-wan...

972
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,433
Well, if we start growing apart
from each other,

973
01:03:41,643 --> 01:03:46,398
and if the butterflies die
because we're no longer crazy in love,

974
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,235
I want you to tell me first

975
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:52,946
that we should break up.

976
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:54,948
Hey.

977
01:03:56,741 --> 01:03:59,077
I was able to put my crazy ex-boyfriend
behind me for good

978
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,705
and start seeing you

979
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,583
because I really like you.

980
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:12,006
<i>You were in tears
But I turned around and left </i>

981
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,050
So I want us to only have good memories.

982
01:04:14,134 --> 01:04:16,636
<i>I was mean to you</i>

983
01:04:17,345 --> 01:04:21,558
<i>But you still waited for me</i>

984
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:26,354
<i>I knew I'd love you</i>

985
01:04:28,982 --> 01:04:33,486
<i>The day we first met</i>

986
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:42,036
<i>Even if you falter</i>

987
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:47,375
<i>As our love fades with time</i>

988
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:53,840
<i>I will be your anchor
Just like you were to me</i>

989
01:04:54,716 --> 01:04:58,470
<i>It must've been so hard</i>

990
01:04:58,553 --> 01:05:05,143
<i>You warmly embraced even my foolish tears</i>

991
01:05:06,644 --> 01:05:10,940
<i>I knew I'd love you</i>

992
01:05:13,568 --> 01:05:17,697
<i>The day we first met</i>

993
01:05:20,408 --> 01:05:26,498
<i>Even if you falter</i>

994
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:31,961
<i>As our love fades with time</i>

995
01:05:33,213 --> 01:05:35,673
<i>I will be your anchor</i>

996
01:05:36,424 --> 01:05:39,552
<i>Don't worry about anything</i>

997
01:05:39,928 --> 01:05:42,847
<i>Just hold my hand</i>

998
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:47,644
<i>Like the day we first met</i>

999
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:50,563
<i>Us two</i>

1000
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:14,128
SPRING OF 2016

1001
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:25,807
PASSENGER ELEVATOR

1002
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:30,854
Could you press seven?

1003
01:06:30,937 --> 01:06:32,230
Oh, sure.

1004
01:06:32,313 --> 01:06:33,565
Thank you.

1005
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:41,823
Excuse me.

1006
01:06:42,574 --> 01:06:44,033
The sixth floor, right?

1007
01:06:44,117 --> 01:06:45,827
Done.

1008
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,203
Thank you.

1009
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:56,629
Be careful. Sorry.

1010
01:06:56,713 --> 01:06:58,631
Sorry about that. Thank you.

1011
01:06:59,132 --> 01:07:00,008
Excuse me.

1012
01:07:00,091 --> 01:07:01,634
I already pressed five for you.

1013
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,344
I hope you have an easy delivery.

1014
01:07:03,428 --> 01:07:04,888
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1015
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:25,450
Excuse me.

1016
01:07:26,534 --> 01:07:28,328
Are you headed to Neurosurgery
by any chance?

1017
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,829
Me? Yes.

1018
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:31,039
Are you an intern?

1019
01:07:32,665 --> 01:07:36,044
It's my first day as an intern here.
I was wondering if you were an intern too.

1020
01:07:37,545 --> 01:07:40,006
Do I look like an intern?

1021
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,845
You're starting in NS? Poor you.

1022
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:51,601
Did you two go to the same school?

1023
01:07:52,185 --> 01:07:54,354
No, we met today.

1024
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:56,356
Hello, Professor Chae.

1025
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,815
Hi.

1026
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:01,778
Professor Chae, they are our new interns.

1027
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,781
Oh, hello.

1028
01:08:04,864 --> 01:08:07,951
Say hello. This is Professor Chae Song-hwa
of Neurosurgery.

1029
01:08:08,534 --> 01:08:09,786
-Hello.
-Hello.

1030
01:08:10,536 --> 01:08:11,871
It's nice to meet you.

1031
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:16,501
I hope to see you guys again in NS
next year.

YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1033
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:40,775
I couldn't really hear you.
Can you say that again?

1034
01:08:40,858 --> 01:08:42,944
<i>We found a donor, Professor Kim.</i>

1035
01:08:43,027 --> 01:08:45,113
-Age?
-<i>It's a four-year-old girl.</i>

1036
01:08:45,196 --> 01:08:46,948
<i>She weighs 18kg, and her blood type is O.</i>

1037
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,157
-<i>She's a TA victim.</i>
-My gosh.

1038
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,619
<i>They'll soon decide whether
she should be declared brain-dead,</i>

1039
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:53,746
<i>so I'll call you
once they make their decision.</i>

1040
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,998
Okay, thank you.

1041
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:10,930
I hope you didn't tell Chae-yun's mom
about this brain-dead patient.

1042
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:12,473
Gosh, seriously?

1043
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:15,435
Professor Kim, what do you take me for?

1044
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,562
No, I haven't told her.

1045
01:09:18,062 --> 01:09:21,274
If Chae-yun can't get the surgery,
she'll be so disappointed.

1046
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:24,694
I know that much.

1047
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:26,446
I was asking just in case.

1048
01:09:28,322 --> 01:09:29,699
-What happened?
-<i>Professor Kim.</i>

1049
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:31,409
<i>The committee just met,</i>

1050
01:09:31,492 --> 01:09:33,453
<i>and they declared her brain-dead.</i>

1051
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:37,540
<i>She'll be admitted at 9 a.m. tomorrow
as a donor.</i>

1052
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,375
Thank you.

1053
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:49,052
We found a donor.

1054
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:53,389
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

1055
01:09:53,473 --> 01:09:56,851
You should thank the donor's family,
not me.

1056
01:09:57,977 --> 01:10:01,022
Well, we should be very thankful

1057
01:10:01,105 --> 01:10:04,859
to have found a donor.
It is a huge relief,

1058
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:08,362
but the donor's heart is quite big
for Chae-yun.

1059
01:10:08,446 --> 01:10:10,573
She weighs over three times more
than Chae-yun does,

1060
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:12,617
so even if Chae-yun's heart is enlarged,

1061
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,078
the heart will most likely be big
for Chae-yun.

1062
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:21,709
However, we're not in the position
where we can be picky about that stuff.

1063
01:10:22,168 --> 01:10:24,629
The clock is ticking for Chae-yun.

1064
01:10:25,213 --> 01:10:26,380
Let's do the surgery.

1065
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:28,382
Okay.

1066
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:31,052
They'll procure the donor's heart
tomorrow morning,

1067
01:10:31,135 --> 01:10:33,179
and the two of us
will oversee the process in the OR.

1068
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,931
It won't be easy,

1069
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,517
but we'll do our best.

1070
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:05,753
Professor Kim, would you like me
to give you a wake-up call tomorrow?

1071
01:11:05,837 --> 01:11:07,672
Jae-hak, I think I have a fever.
Can you check?

1072
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:16,305
Maybe a mild fever?

1073
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:21,394
I can't have a fever.
I have to perform the surgery tomorrow.

1074
01:11:37,785 --> 01:11:39,287
You fool.

1075
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,713
-How does it look?
-<i>The heart is in good condition.</i>

1076
01:11:48,796 --> 01:11:50,173
<i>We can proceed with the surgery.</i>

1077
01:11:50,256 --> 01:11:51,382
Okay.

1078
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:56,721
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1079
01:11:57,805 --> 01:11:59,098
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

1080
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:00,725
I feel pain where the surgery was done,

1081
01:12:00,808 --> 01:12:02,977
and I'm all bloated.
I just don't feel well.

1082
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,439
I see. It's natural to experience
a lot of discomfort after the surgery.

1083
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,065
But the surgery went well.

1084
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:11,569
So hang in there,
and you'll become much healthier.

1085
01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:13,905
I know it won't be easy
but try to walk a little.

1086
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:15,489
It'll help you pass the gas soon.

1087
01:12:15,573 --> 01:12:16,741
Okay, thank you.

1088
01:12:16,824 --> 01:12:18,117
No problem. Try to walk a little.

1089
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:19,202
I will.

1090
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:22,830
What are you guys looking at?

1091
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:26,000
So-mi uploaded her first video
after leaving the hospital.

1092
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,919
-Gosh.
-I subscribed to her channel.

1093
01:12:28,002 --> 01:12:30,379
Ms. Song, So-mi is very good at editing.
She has a knack for this.

1094
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,882
Who's this? Hong-do is in the thumbnail.

1095
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:33,966
What?

1096
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,010
I'm off.

1097
01:12:37,094 --> 01:12:38,971
Oh, it's not Hong-do.

1098
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:43,935
It's Ms. Song.

1099
01:12:44,018 --> 01:12:46,646
Ms. Song, So-mi uploaded a video of you.

1100
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:49,190
What?

1101
01:12:49,815 --> 01:12:51,859
STOP LOOKING AT THE HANDSOME MED STUDENT
THE WOMAN OF THE HOUR IS...

1102
01:12:51,943 --> 01:12:56,530
<i>Jae-hwan, the IV and IM ampoules
should be kept separate.</i>

1103
01:12:56,614 --> 01:12:58,241
-<i>Got it.</i>
-What is this?

1104
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:01,702
NURSE SONG SU-BIN AT YULJE MEDICAL CENTER
WHO IS ALSO SO-MI'S MOM

1105
01:13:01,786 --> 01:13:03,079
<i>Intern!</i>

1106
01:13:03,996 --> 01:13:07,124
<i>This patient needs to get
the tests done now, so please go with him.</i>

1107
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:10,211
<i>You have to monitor his SpO2 level
to make sure it doesn't drop.</i>

1108
01:13:10,294 --> 01:13:12,922
<i>Gosh, what do we do with all this?</i>

1109
01:13:13,464 --> 01:13:14,924
<i>So-mi.</i>

1110
01:13:15,508 --> 01:13:17,343
<i>I feel bad wasting all this food.</i>

1111
01:13:17,718 --> 01:13:19,720
<i>Just have one more spoon of rice
with the soup, okay?</i>

1112
01:13:19,804 --> 01:13:22,390
<i>No, I weigh 43kg now. I won't eat.</i>

1113
01:13:22,473 --> 01:13:24,976
<i>You just got your surgery.
Why would you go on a diet now?</i>

1114
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:27,019
<i>Put that thing down.</i>

1115
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,981
<i>So what time
do I have to be here tomorrow?</i>

1116
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:32,191
<i>He didn't even explain everything.</i>

1117
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,404
<i>Ms. Yoo Sang-eun will be the first one
to go into surgery tomorrow morning.</i>

1118
01:13:36,487 --> 01:13:39,198
<i>She'll be moved to the OR
around 7:30 a.m.,</i>

1119
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:41,367
<i>so just be here by 7 a.m.</i>

1120
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,244
<i>The surgery will take about two hours,</i>

1121
01:13:43,327 --> 01:13:46,247
<i>but the whole process will take
a bit longer because of the anesthesia.</i>

1122
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:49,250
<i>The surgery will go well,
so don't worry. Get some rest.</i>

1123
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,835
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

1124
01:13:50,918 --> 01:13:51,877
<i>No problem.</i>

1125
01:13:53,004 --> 01:13:54,130
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1126
01:13:54,839 --> 01:13:55,840
<i>You need to eat.</i>

1127
01:13:56,007 --> 01:13:57,800
<i>Put that down, So-mi.</i>

1128
01:13:57,883 --> 01:13:59,969
<i>Just have one more spoon of rice, okay?</i>

1129
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:01,887
MY MOM, WHO TOLD ME TO HAVE
ONE MORE SPOON OF RICE

1130
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:04,098
GOES TO CHECK ON PATIENTS
WITHOUT DRINKING A CUP A WATER...

1131
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:06,642
<i>I'll check the patient in Room Eight,
Lee Jang-u's vital signs</i>

1132
01:14:06,726 --> 01:14:08,644
<i>and see if a bed is ready in Room Three.</i>

1133
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:11,355
OFF TO THE ROOM
WITH A BIG SMILE ON HER FACE!

1134
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:13,858
<i>Ma'am, we need to get
Lee Jae-guk's consent for ERCP.</i>

1135
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:14,900
<i>How should I explain it?</i>

1136
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:18,571
<i>After his cholecystectomy,
he has a high total bilirubin level.</i>

1137
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:21,115
<i>From the MRCP exam, we found a CBD stone,
so he's getting ERCP.</i>

1138
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:23,409
MY MOM IS AWESOME
I FEEL LIKE I'M WATCHING A MEDICAL DRAMA

1139
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:25,911
<i>So-mi, I have portrait rights.</i>

1140
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,788
<i>Why don't you get my permission first?</i>

1141
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,542
<i>You totally got it wrong.
I wasn't filming you.</i>

1142
01:14:34,462 --> 01:14:39,091
HER BUSY DAY CONTINUED
EVEN AFTER THAT

1143
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:44,305
I'M ROOTING FOR MS. SONG
AND ALL THE OTHER NURSES

1144
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:46,515
My gosh.

1145
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:50,978
I should have a daughter too.

1146
01:14:51,062 --> 01:14:52,229
Boys can do the same.

1147
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:55,608
I know. I'm just envious of Ms. Song.

1148
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,443
But... You know,

1149
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,653
So-mi and I had a huge fight this morning.

1150
01:14:59,737 --> 01:15:02,198
Gosh, I never know
what that girl is thinking.

1151
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:03,991
My goodness.

1152
01:15:05,076 --> 01:15:06,994
Im Jang-hun has been on POD for ten days,

1153
01:15:07,078 --> 01:15:09,538
but his brain CT scan shows
that most of his ICH has resolved.

1154
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:13,459
His motor responses are also improving,
so we'll move him to Rehabilitation.

1155
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:17,505
That's such good news. I was so worried.

1156
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:23,886
Try lifting your right leg, please.

1157
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:28,432
Can you draw up your right knee?

1158
01:15:34,146 --> 01:15:36,107
His leg has improved a lot more
than I expected.

1159
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:39,318
Yes, Doctor. It's still pretty weak,

1160
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,362
but it responds now.

1161
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:42,738
I'm so relieved.

1162
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:45,950
It'll improve a lot more
with the rehabilitation therapy.

1163
01:15:46,033 --> 01:15:47,576
What's the point?

1164
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,370
I can't move my arm.

1165
01:15:49,954 --> 01:15:52,289
Honey, why are you being like this?

1166
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,708
Your arm will recover soon too.

1167
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:55,876
No, it won't.

1168
01:15:56,961 --> 01:15:58,087
It's been completely numb

1169
01:15:59,713 --> 01:16:01,173
for over ten days.

1170
01:16:02,716 --> 01:16:05,428
Doctor, I won't be able
to use the arm forever, right?

1171
01:16:07,054 --> 01:16:08,722
I can't do anything with my right arm

1172
01:16:09,515 --> 01:16:10,850
for the rest of my life, right?

1173
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,060
The hemorrhage took place

1174
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:15,980
in the part that controls the limbs.
That's why it's still weak.

1175
01:16:16,063 --> 01:16:18,607
But the damage occurred
before the surgery,

1176
01:16:18,691 --> 01:16:21,485
so at the moment, we're not sure
whether or not it can recover.

1177
01:16:22,862 --> 01:16:25,114
The leg has certainly improved a lot,

1178
01:16:25,197 --> 01:16:27,575
but the arm might take a while.

1179
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:32,830
You're still young,
so you shouldn't give up.

1180
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:36,250
I've seen patients recover
with ongoing rehabilitation therapy.

1181
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:38,752
Why did you bother saving my life?

1182
01:16:38,836 --> 01:16:40,421
Honey, have you lost your mind?

1183
01:16:41,046 --> 01:16:43,382
Seriously, why are you being like this?

1184
01:16:46,886 --> 01:16:48,387
It was the best choice we could make.

1185
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,099
The surgery went well,
and the hemorrhage has resolved.

1186
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:55,519
I suggest you keep up with your
rehabilitation therapy and be patient.

1187
01:16:55,603 --> 01:16:57,897
How can I live like this?

1188
01:16:58,898 --> 01:17:01,150
I can't use one arm!

1189
01:17:02,067 --> 01:17:03,903
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1190
01:17:05,613 --> 01:17:07,239
I don't want to live.

1191
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,867
My life is over.

1192
01:17:20,586 --> 01:17:23,422
There was some adhesion caused
by being on the ECMO for months.

1193
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:26,050
In cases like that,
it's important to make sure

1194
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:28,886
we can open the chest for the transplant
without a cardiac event.

1195
01:17:30,095 --> 01:17:32,723
Thankfully, we managed to perform
the transplant without any events.

1196
01:17:32,806 --> 01:17:37,102
-My gosh. Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you so much, Doctor.

1197
01:17:37,228 --> 01:17:39,355
But it took a while for us
to open the chest.

1198
01:17:39,438 --> 01:17:42,149
The donor's heart is pumping well,

1199
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:45,528
but it's a little big and swollen
as we expected.

1200
01:17:45,611 --> 01:17:47,655
We left the chest open
as it was hard to close it up.

1201
01:17:47,738 --> 01:17:49,406
We'll try closing it again

1202
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,325
when the swelling goes down in a few days.

1203
01:17:52,284 --> 01:17:55,162
Anyway, the surgery went well.

1204
01:17:55,246 --> 01:17:57,665
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thank you, Doctor.

1205
01:17:57,748 --> 01:17:58,624
Thank you so much.

1206
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,210
Please wait outside.
I'll make sure you can see Chae-yun soon.

1207
01:18:01,293 --> 01:18:03,087
They're tidying up now,

1208
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:05,422
so you should be able to see her
in about an hour.

1209
01:18:05,506 --> 01:18:07,925
-Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
-Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

1210
01:18:08,008 --> 01:18:09,677
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1211
01:18:09,843 --> 01:18:11,011
Thank you.

1212
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:22,690
Everything will go well, right?

1213
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:26,986
Professor Kim, you perform this surgery
every day. What's with you?

1214
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,696
The surgery went well, you know.

1215
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:29,697
Well...

1216
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:32,700
We have to reduce the IO ratio
to make the swelling go down.

1217
01:18:32,783 --> 01:18:34,451
Let's close her up in a few days, okay?

1218
01:18:36,662 --> 01:18:38,247
Keep monitoring her to see

1219
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,208
if she's bleeding
and make sure she's urinating well, okay?

1220
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,334
Got it?

1221
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:44,336
You got it?

1222
01:19:01,145 --> 01:19:02,938
Because of the size of her liver,

1223
01:19:05,232 --> 01:19:06,150
she can't be a donor.

1224
01:19:08,152 --> 01:19:09,820
More than 30 percent of the liver

1225
01:19:09,903 --> 01:19:13,240
should be left after the partial removal
to ensure the donor's safety.

1226
01:19:13,365 --> 01:19:15,326
In her case, only 25 percent will be left.

1227
01:19:15,409 --> 01:19:17,244
We'll need to find another donor.

1228
01:19:17,328 --> 01:19:19,371
Gosh...

1229
01:19:19,997 --> 01:19:22,875
Doctor, I'm relieved to hear this.

1230
01:19:26,712 --> 01:19:29,506
Honey, I'm so relieved.

1231
01:19:30,883 --> 01:19:33,093
Even if your liver was suitable,

1232
01:19:33,552 --> 01:19:34,678
I wouldn't let you do it.

1233
01:19:36,847 --> 01:19:38,015
I'm ill, you know.

1234
01:19:38,932 --> 01:19:40,267
If you also ruin your health,

1235
01:19:41,018 --> 01:19:42,311
it'll hurt me even more.

1236
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,276
Who will look after Dong-ju?

1237
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:52,321
His daddy is ill,

1238
01:19:53,072 --> 01:19:54,573
so he needs a healthy mom.

1239
01:19:56,283 --> 01:19:57,701
I'm really okay.

1240
01:20:00,871 --> 01:20:01,705
Mother.

1241
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:06,960
Stop stressing my wife about this.

1242
01:20:07,878 --> 01:20:09,296
This is about the three of us.

1243
01:20:10,923 --> 01:20:12,424
We'll figure out what to do.

1244
01:20:37,574 --> 01:20:39,326
Oh, thanks.

1245
01:20:40,494 --> 01:20:41,370
It's cold.

1246
01:20:41,453 --> 01:20:42,579
Thanks.

1247
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:51,964
He was out of line.

1248
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:56,969
I mean, you saved that patient,
Im Jang-hun.

1249
01:20:58,303 --> 01:21:00,264
-Chi-hong.
-Yes.

1250
01:21:00,347 --> 01:21:03,100
Can you go speak to his wife?

1251
01:21:07,146 --> 01:21:08,856
She must be stressed out as well.

1252
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:13,777
Tell her that I'm not too busy
and let her know that she can call me

1253
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:18,449
whenever she has any questions
about his condition and rehabilitation.

1254
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,745
I might make her uncomfortable
if I tell her this myself,

1255
01:21:22,828 --> 01:21:24,580
so I want you to tell her.

1256
01:21:42,806 --> 01:21:45,225
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1257
01:21:46,477 --> 01:21:47,478
What?

1258
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:54,109
I've already told the director

1259
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,279
that I want to work at the Sokcho branch
for just a year.

1260
01:21:57,362 --> 01:21:59,072
What the heck are you talking about?

1261
01:22:00,157 --> 01:22:01,658
Why would you go there all of a sudden?

1262
01:22:02,743 --> 01:22:04,036
My neck hurts a lot.

1263
01:22:05,412 --> 01:22:06,997
I need a break. I want to get some rest.

1264
01:22:09,041 --> 01:22:11,460
They perform less surgical procedures
than we do,

1265
01:22:11,543 --> 01:22:13,921
so I'll take it easy
and get my disc problem treated.

1266
01:22:14,004 --> 01:22:16,048
I also want to study while I'm there.

1267
01:22:18,258 --> 01:22:20,010
I'll visit Seoul often,

1268
01:22:20,177 --> 01:22:24,181
and I'll take care of the VIP surgeries
if I can get the schedule in advance.

1269
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:28,435
And about that thing, I should definitely
be able to take care of it there.

1270
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:33,732
Why did you decide something
like that without talking to us first?

1271
01:22:34,358 --> 01:22:36,443
I'm sure Song-hwa made
the best decision for herself.

1272
01:22:36,527 --> 01:22:38,570
Don't get so worked up, okay?

1273
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:39,613
If she's gone...

1274
01:22:41,782 --> 01:22:44,618
Then what about the band?
What will happen to our band?

1275
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:46,870
I'll be in Seoul every weekend.

1276
01:22:47,454 --> 01:22:49,665
Sokcho is only two hours away.
It's not far.

1277
01:22:49,748 --> 01:22:52,876
Yes, just divide your time
between Seoul and Sokcho.

1278
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,837
You should get your neck treated first.

1279
01:22:57,923 --> 01:22:59,216
Hey, Seok-hyeong.

1280
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:01,093
How's your mom?

1281
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,178
She has to carefully monitor
her blood pressure.

1282
01:23:04,471 --> 01:23:06,390
Worry about yourself first.

1283
01:23:06,473 --> 01:23:08,308
My mom is healthier than you.

1284
01:23:09,226 --> 01:23:13,480
She just feels weak these days.
That's why she's in the hospital now.

1285
01:23:13,981 --> 01:23:14,940
It's nothing serious.

1286
01:23:21,947 --> 01:23:23,949
Mom, Mr. Pyeon is here.

1287
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,409
Mr. Pyeon? Why is he here?

1288
01:23:27,995 --> 01:23:30,330
Hello, Mr. Pyeon. How have you been?

1289
01:23:31,123 --> 01:23:33,625
What brings you by?

1290
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:39,089
I just got a call
from Chairman Yang Tae-yang's lawyer.

1291
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:45,087
I just got a call
from Chairman Yang Tae-yang's lawyer.

1292
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:50,592
Apparently, Chairman Yang left a will.

1293
01:23:53,387 --> 01:23:56,932
The lawyer
and Chairman Yang's chief secretary

1294
01:23:57,015 --> 01:24:00,602
would like to go over the will
with the two of you in person.

1295
01:24:00,686 --> 01:24:03,021
They're on their way here now.

1296
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,011
Me?

1297
01:24:34,553 --> 01:24:36,263
But the thing is,

1298
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:39,475
I'm a nobody to Professor Ahn.

1299
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:41,560
I'm his mom, you know.

1300
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:44,229
I know my son very well.

1301
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:49,067
I saw you having a conversation
with my son.

1302
01:24:50,736 --> 01:24:54,698
I could tell from the way
he was looking at you

1303
01:24:56,742 --> 01:24:57,910
that he really

1304
01:24:59,036 --> 01:25:00,704
cares about you

1305
01:25:01,789 --> 01:25:03,165
and likes you a lot.

1306
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:16,136
When my son likes or dislikes something,

1307
01:25:17,805 --> 01:25:19,848
it all shows on his face.

1308
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:26,230
You may think I'm nosy,
and I could be wrong.

1309
01:25:29,149 --> 01:25:32,194
But this is like my last hope.
I'm afraid I must ask

1310
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:38,784
a big favor

1311
01:25:40,911 --> 01:25:42,329
of you.

1312
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,840
Can you please ask him to stay?

1313
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,553
Ask him to give up

1314
01:26:00,264 --> 01:26:02,057
becoming a priest

1315
01:26:03,267 --> 01:26:05,269
and stay at the hospital.

1316
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,438
Please ask him for me.

1317
01:26:14,653 --> 01:26:15,779
Please?

What if I make the wrong decision
every single time?

1325
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:14,713
Professor Kim.

He only cared about himself all his life,
that worthless leech.

1333
01:27:31,104 --> 01:27:32,648
You won't go to the airport tomorrow?

1334
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:34,441
<i>Ik-sun is leaving.</i>

1335
01:27:34,524 --> 01:27:36,318
<i>Am I putting too much pressure on her?</i>

01:27:36,401 --> 01:27:37,986
<i>Will it be okay to send this to her?</i>

1337
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,907
<i>Professor, I hope you don't have to work

I'll take you out for a nice meal.

I heard you're transferring
to the Sokcho branch.
