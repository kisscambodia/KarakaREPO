[Pretending to be the Princess]

00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,000
Sweet and Sour Ribs.

00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,400
Sweet--

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,900
What type of person is this?!

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Princess, Prince Consort I am here to help you guys get ready.

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,300
Okay, come in.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,100
-You--
-What's the matter?

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,000
I scared her because I was sleeping on the floor.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,700
We will go outside to settle matters.

12
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,300
-You--
-Let's go.

13
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
Speak! Where did you hide Princess?!

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't know where your Princess went.

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Speak! Where's Princess?!

16
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,200
I-I really don't know.

17
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,100
Are you going to tell us or not?!

18
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,800
I-I seem to have encountered your Princess at Ruyi Restaurant.

19
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,600
How would you encounter our Princess at Ruyi Restaurant?

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,000
Hear me out, okay?

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,070
I am just someone who performs for a living.

22
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,000
I have to pay my father's gambling debts.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I was sold to the Green Dragon Fort as a bride.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Then the bandits asked me to take a shower at Ruyi Restaurant before heading up the mountain.

25
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Then I encountered your Princess.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Then later, I somehow got married to Third Young Master Mei.

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,400
I swear if I said a single lie, I will be striked by lightning!

28
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,800
Princess really did escape the marriage.

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
-Escape the marriage?
-Escape the marriage?

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,600
His Majesty has married off Princess to Young General Mei.

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Escaping a marriage is a crime of defying the orders of His Majesty.

32
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,500
Crime of defying orders of His Majesty?

33
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,990
What do you mean by a crime of defying orders of His Majesty?

34
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,700
It means killing the whole family and the bloodline of nine generations.

35
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't cry first, maybe there's a solution.

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Unless you can pretend to be Princess until we can find her!

37
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
I don't want to.

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,100
Mei Manor, Ninth Prince Manor, also your Father.

39
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,200
We will all have to die.

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,980
I have walked the lands for so many years,

41
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,000
you can't scare me like that.

42
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,800
-Qiaoyun, don't--
-Let go! Let go!

43
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
O-Okay, I'll help you!

44
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Attempting suicide.

45
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,200
But you have to agree to a condition of mine.

46
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
Help me find my dad.

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,200
I promise you.

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
It is all my fault for falling asleep last night.

49
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,200
Here.

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I am Princess's personal maid, my name is Qiao Yun.

51
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,400
He is Princess's personal guard, his name is Qiu Hua.

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,000
How about you? What's your name?

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,200
Just call me Xiao Wanzi.

54
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't have any personal items.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Xiao Wanzi, don't worry, this Third Young Master Mei, he can't see.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
There is also no one here who recognizes what Princess looks like.

57
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
As long as you follow my lead, there won't be any problems.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Alright.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Also one more thing.

60
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Did you and Third Young Master Mei make love?

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,100
How would that be possible?!

62
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,000
Also he doesn't want to marry your Princess either.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
How can that be good?!

64
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
Xiao Wanzi, I beg of you,

65
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,000
you have to protect our Princess's marriage.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,200
This isn't easy. He already said

67
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,800
we don't intercept one another's paths.

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,070
We are married only in name, there is no relationship.

69
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,600
If I were to guess he is thinking of how to divorce your Princess.

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,000
This is only to protect you and I, and everyone's life.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,200
As long as you listen, and agree,

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,800
there is no reason for Third Young Master Mei to divorce.

73
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,500
No.

74
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,800
What if Third Young Master Mei falls in love with me?

75
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,400
You are pretending to be the Princess, you won't actually become the Princess.

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,200
How would Third Young Master Mei fall in love with a performer?

77
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,300
Alright, what you are saying makes sense.

78
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,700
But...you guys have to help me find my father.

79
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,200
I promise you.

80
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Right, don't make love with Third Young Master Mei okay?

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,200
What are you saying? There's a male here!

82
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Then let's quickly go, Third Young Master Mei is still waiting.

83
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
Siheng.

84
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,800
I can help you to wash your face.

85
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you, Princess.

86
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Why are you using so much strength for?!

87
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,000
I am helping you wash your face.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
If you can't do it well, then give it to Siheng.

89
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
He's a male,

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,400
he can't be gentle or hard, for these type of things, it is better if I...

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,200
No, wifey do.

92
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
I have just become a wife, please be open-minded, Prince Consort.

93
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Open-minded.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
From today onwards, your face

95
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
will be my face.

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Here.

97
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Wasting such a handsome face for nothing.

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Don't know better, if it weren't for Qiao Yun,

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,700
I wouldn't serve you.

100
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
Do you have a fever?

101
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
No.

102
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,250
Then why is your face so warm?

103
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,100
That's good enough, if you continue to wash, the skin will fall.

104
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,600
Okay. Then may I ask, do you have any other requests, husband?

105
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,000
Help me change a belt.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Okay.

107
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Please stand up.

108
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
How is it, Husband?

109
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,320
It's not comfortable. Change it.

110
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,310
How about this one, Husband?

111
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,050
The leather isn't good. Change it.

112
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,440
It doesn't feel good. Change it.

113
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,440
How does this one feel?

114
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,210
Are you crazy?

115
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,450
You want to murder your husband on the first day of your marriage.

116
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,970
What poor taste. I'll do it myself!

117
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,700
It's this one. It smells good.

118
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,180
Wasn't this the first one?

119
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,770
Is that so? I have such good taste.

120
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,920
Good morning, Third Young Master and Princess.

121
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
What is it?

122
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
The General sympathizes with the Princess' weariness from her journey.

123
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,950
He excuses you two newly-weds from morning greetings.

124
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,450
At noon, tea will be served at the family banquet.

125
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,060
Alright, I know.

126
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,280
Then I will leave now.

127
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,280
What are you doing?

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,950
In order to save the lives of the three of us,

129
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,820
you must undergo emergency special training now.

130
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,810
What training?

131
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,290
How to become a princess.

132
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,440
Father, please drink some tea.

133
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,390
Use two hands.

134
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,860
Father, please drink some tea.

135
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,820
Tighten your legs.

136
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,780
Lift your waist.

137
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,050
Finally. Oh my god!

138
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,290
How could you eat like that? Eat them one by one.

139
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,250
I quit!

140
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,940
This is inhumane! If I'm fake, I'm fake.

141
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,020
No matter what, I can't become real.

142
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,480
Here, here.

143
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,870
Xiao Wanzi. Let me tell you,

144
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,260
you actually have a lot in common with the Princess.

145
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,990
Really?

146
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,540
It's true that some people have said that I have a unique temperament.

147
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,820
That's right! So it's natural that you can pretend to be the Princess, right?

148
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,250
But what if they see through me at the family banquet?

149
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,820
According to my experience,

150
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,300
you just need to keep your back straight, eat less, and talk less.

151
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,180
Then you'll basically be able to get through the situation.

152
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,880
For the rest, you can just act based on my eye signals. There won't be any issues.

153
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,450
Will that work?

154
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,790
Of course! I'm always by the Princess' side.

155
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,390
If I say it will work, it will.

156
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,620
Repeat what I said.

157
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,350
Keep your back straight.

158
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,080
Eat less and talk less.

159
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,030
Right.

160
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,140
Where's my dad?

161
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,560
I went to the Penglai Gambling House, but I didn't find your father.

162
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,850
Then where did my dad go?

163
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,390
Did anything happen to him?

164
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,140
Don't worry.

165
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,690
Let's get through this first and save our lives.

166
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,590
We'll find your dad sooner or later.

167
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,780
Is there any news from Old Eight?

168
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,450
Not yet. A'Rou's men are still watching.

169
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,400
Young Master, the family banquet is about to begin.

170
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,510
Why don't we go back to prepare?

171
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,590
What are you doing?

172
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,930
Wait, wait. Husband, let me help you.

173
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,930
No need, I can... I can walk by myself.

174
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,530
It's okay, I'm quite strong.

175
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,650
Besides, it's my duty to take care of my husband.

176
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,220
Dad, when will you help me get a wife?

177
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Mom, Dad.

178
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,120
I'll find you the best one. Don't rush.

179
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,860
Mom is the best. 
 Princess. Shiqing, take a seat.

180
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,920
Father, Second Madam, Second Young Master.

181
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,160
Husband, please have a seat.

182
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,950
The Princess serves tea to the General and Madam.

183
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,400
Father.

184
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,070
Father, please have some tea. 
 Good.

185
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,160
Second Madam.

186
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,790
Second Madam, please have some tea.

187
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,060
Princess, please have a seat.

188
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,040
Thank you, Father.

189
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,460
Princess, my Mei Manor cannot compare to the palace.

190
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,690
I don't know if you are growing accustomed to living here.

191
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,600
Everything is fine. Thank you for your concern, Father.

192
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,570
Siqing, it is my Mei Family's blessing

193
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,090
that you could marry the Princess.

194
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,830
You must treat the Princess well from now on, understood?

195
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,360
Princess, Shiqing usually doesn't talk much.

196
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,960
If you feel bored, you can come to me and I'll help you pass time.

197
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,460
Thank you for your concern, Second Madam.

198
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,780
Ever since I was ennobled last time,

199
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,720
there hasn't been a celebratory occasion in my Mei Family for almost ten years.

200
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,300
Come on, let's all eat. We can talk while we eat.

201
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,260
Princess, Shiqing's eyes aren't in a good condition right now.

202
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,560
In the future, he will rely on you to take care of him.

203
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,990
Alright, Second Madam. You can rest assured.

204
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,590
Shiqing, what do you want to eat? You can just tell me.

205
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,900
Here.

206
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,030
Father, there is something that I'd still like to say.

207
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,190
Since I'm already married, please allow me to move out.

208
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,760
Let's discuss this after we are done eating.

209
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,500
Seeing as everyone is here, I thought I might as well make it clear.

210
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,520
Is this also the Princess' wish?

211
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,490
Yes, Father. Siqing's wishes are my wishes.

212
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,520
Since the Princess is already married to me,

213
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,060
she naturally follows my arrangements.

214
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,060
I'm not dead yet

215
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,470
. You're so anxious to move out?

216
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,860
Shiqing. You and the Princess have just gotten married.

217
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,400
Why would you mention moving out?

218
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,760
What are you doing?

219
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,190
If I have to move out when I'm married,

220
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,120
I'd rather get married after Dad is dead.

221
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,570
Shut your mouth!

222
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,680
No, Dad. I want to be with you and mom. 
 Husband, husband.

223
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,490
Husband, don't be angry. Shiyuan had good intentions.

224
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,090
It's just that his mouth is a little clumsy.

225
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,370
These two rebellious sons. One is wicked and one is stupid!

226
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,190
I'm going to be killed by them.

227
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,490
Mei Shiqing, let me tell you.

228
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,830
As long as I'm still alive, I have the final say.

229
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,240
You are married. But you have to stay in this family as well.

230
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,370
You keep talking about the Mei Family.

231
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,510
You want the Mei Family's glory, wealth, and fortune, right?

232
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,890
My mother and I have done our best for the Mei Family.

233
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,660
How dare you!

234
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,430
Mei Shiqing, don't go too far.

235
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,800
Your father just doesn't want to argue with you.

236
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,420
In my opinion, you are just pretending to be blind to escape from the marriage.

237
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,830
Shut up!

238
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,590
I've made my decision. Father, please agree.

239
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,890
Rebellious. So rebellious!

240
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,160
Tao Juzheng, bring me the punishment tool!

241
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,760
Master.

242
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,820
Kneel down!

243
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,400
Father! Father, stop beating him!

244
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,260
Princess, stay out of this. I must teach this boy a lesson today.

245
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,890
I must teach this boy a lesson today.

246
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,460
If you want to hit someone, hit me.

247
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,230
I'm his wife. I'm sure the Emperor will understand if you hit me.

248
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,430
Alright, you bastard.

249
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,260
Today, I'll spare you once for the Princess' sake.

250
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,100
Princess. You are a member of the Mei Family now.

251
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,240
If this brat makes a mistake again, will you protect him every time?

252
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,540
Yes!

253
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,570
♫ Scene after scene flashes by ♫

254
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,530
♫ Lifting my head, I gaze at the galaxy ♫

255
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:13,690
♫ I diligently become more persistent little by little ♫

256
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,530
♫ Even if I'm fearfully gambling, ♫

257
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,640
Mei Shiqing! Since the Princess is protecting you today,

258
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,060
I'll let you go this time. Mind your behavior.

259
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,730
♫ My heart is like fire, burning for you ♫

260
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,330
♫ Even my tears are hot ♫

261
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,490
Princess. 
 Young Master.

262
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,100
Princess. Don't blame Shiqing's father for being too cruel.

263
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,070
There's an old saying that an uncut gem is not useful.

264
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,870
Everything is for the good of Third Young Master.

265
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,970
Shiqing lost his mother at a young age.

266
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,600
How could Shiqing's father not educate him?

267
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,030
However, Shiqing has finally lived up to his father's expectations.

268
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,940
Didn't you marry him?

269
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,950
Won't you eat a little more?

270
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,480
The dishes are getting cold. Here.

271
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,990
There's nothing to be afraid of if the dishes get cold.

272
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,790
The scariest thing is a cold heart.

273
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,020
To think that in the end, an outsider came to help me.

274
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,060
Look at his attitude. I doubt he can still hold on much more.

275
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,140
How long can the Princess protect you?

276
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,150
A dignified princess married a blind man!

277
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,900
Just then, didn't I really have the stance of the Princess?

278
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,340
- Acting as the Princess isn't that hard. 
- Shh!

279
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,190
- Lower your voice. 
- I got it, there are ears listening everywhere.

280
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,420
Xiao Wanzi, you must remember to keep a low profile.

281
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,630
Don't interfere with what you shouldn't interfere with

282
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,910
and don't say what you shouldn't say.

283
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,070
After wandering Jianghu for so many years, I understand that principle at least.

284
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,460
Earlier, it was only because I seriously couldn't watch any longer and helped impulsively.

285
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,710
But, I promise that I'll try to keep a low profile in the future.

286
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,530
Alright, I'll trust you once more.

287
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,870
Next time, don't act rashly and speak impulsively again!

288
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,900
Our lives are in your hands.

289
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,300
We all depend on you, got it?

290
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,050
Okay, okay. You're so young to be blabbering like an old lady.

291
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,230
You're the one who's an old lady!

292
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,710
Princess, the Young Master is hurt quite badly.

293
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,540
Why did you have to speak against General Mei?

294
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,940
He's the master of the family, can't you give him some face?

295
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,920
Shut up.

296
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,060
Is this how you speak to your savior?

297
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,560
At least I saved you! If I hadn't, who knows how badly you would've been whipped.

298
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,730
- Who asked for your help?
- I--

299
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,270
the Princess actually cares about the Prince Consort.

300
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,360
However, she hopes that he can care more about himself.

301
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,190
Right, Princess?

302
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,280
Siheng,

303
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,350
I'll dress the Young Master's wound.

304
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,620
You're hurt so badly.

305
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,680
If it hurts, yell it out and don't hold it in, okay?

306
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,110
Seriously, General Mei. He had to go so hard.

307
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,680
Is this even his own son?

308
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,970
-Someone might thing he holds a large grudge against you.
-Shut up.

309
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,950
Are you exacting vengeance on me?

310
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,710
What did you say?

311
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,450
Don't interfere with my life.

312
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,390
As if I want to!

313
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,920
It's all because-!

314
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,250
It's fine if you don't say thanks, what's with this atittude?

315
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,080
Fine, I was being nosy, alright? I was being nosy!

316
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,840
Since you say that,

317
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,240
then,

318
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,850
I still have to say something.

319
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,590
Quit bothering!

320
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,650
- I--
- We're all one family.

321
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,820
As long as you both have common interests, you can live harmoniously.

322
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,170
Won't that be okay?

323
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,390
She's right, she's right! Princess,

324
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,690
We've all noticed your care for the Young Master.

325
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,550
We all...respect that.

326
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,950
Respect!

327
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,870
It's just breaking up from your family, what's so hard about that?

328
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,740
Build a wall in the yard

329
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,640
and you'll be so peaceful with your own space.

330
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,590
If it's that easy,

331
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,390
then you go do it.

332
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,420
Do you think making a weak lady build a wall is reasonable?

333
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,230
Are you weak?

334
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,860
I can go build it.

335
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,210
But, the problem is, if I do successfully build it, what happens?

336
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,060
What do you mean?

337
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,270
If you want money, say it.

338
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,510
Qiao Yun and Siheng will bear witness.

339
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,930
If I, the Princess, build this wall,

340
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,460
then you, Mei Sanshao,

341
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,060
will have to respectfully and earnestly

342
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,980
bow down to me and thank me.

343
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,760
Good luck.

344
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,210
Princess!

345
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,830
Goodness.

346
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,780
- Princess, where are you going?
- Princess,

347
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,580
Don't be angry, Young Master isn't picking on you!

348
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,860
Don't just see that he is young and accomplished, talented, handsome and charismatic!

349
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,000
Actually, he lost his mother at a young age

350
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,610
and his father is like that.

351
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,110
He's very sensitive, he needs to be protected.

352
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,610
He's also really afraid of spiders.

353
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,470
A grown man who's afraid of spiders?

354
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,290
That's funny.

355
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,010
Our Young Master isn't afraid of pain or death,

356
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,930
but he's really afraid of spiders.

357
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,510
I ask you to keep that in mind, please.

358
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,460
Enough, enough, I got it so stop talking.

359
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,990
Take me to the Housekeeper

360
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,560
to ask for men and materials. We'll build the wall right now.

361
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,640
No matter what you say, I will make him

362
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,820
-thank me in person!
-Yes!

363
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,100
Also, take that side down.

364
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,110
Housekeeper Tao.

365
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,300
What is your command, Princess?

366
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,630
Call for more guards and get men.

367
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,060
We're building a wall.

368
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,880
Building a wall?

369
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,300
What wall?

370
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,210
Just, a wall. What other kind of wall is there?

371
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,830
Princess, to build a wall, we must prepare the materials.

372
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,570
The hour is getting late.

373
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,490
How about tomorrow? How about if I send people over tomorrow?

374
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,290
Tomorrow, then.

375
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,050
Remember to get lots of people early tomorrow morning, okay?

376
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,520
Yes.

377
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,400
Madam, I have something to report to you.

378
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,620
Go ahead.

379
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,880
Princess came to me in a rush.

380
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,490
She asked for men and materials to build a wall.

381
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,910
I didn't know whether I should agree or not, so I pushed it back to tomorrow.

382
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,090
- Build a wall? 
- Build a wall?

383
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,810
What wall?

384
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,510
If my guess is right, it probably to seal the wall of the third courtyard.

385
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,290
Has that Mei Shiqing lost his mind?

386
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,860
I'll go tell my father right now so that even the Princess can't save him.

387
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,200
- Stop right there. 
- Mother?

388
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,980
If you go right now, it's no use.

389
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,520
Let them mess around

390
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,210
so that hopefully, the wall is built a bit higher.

391
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,010
Mother, you're right.

392
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,570
- Tao Juzheng. 
- Yes.

393
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,200
If Third Young Master needs anything,

394
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,180
then try to help him.

395
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,770
You must cooperate with me.

396
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,910
Yes, I understand.

397
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,080
Mother.

398
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,010
Shiyuan, when you come across problems, you have to get it together.

399
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,340
Don't always act like a child.

400
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,880
I got it, mother. What you say is right.

401
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Let's sit and wait for the show tomorrow.

402
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,200
I've been here for so many days...

403
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,100
There's someone guarding outside everyday.

404
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,800
How do I get out?

405
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Master Bao? You-

406
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,200
Who are you guys? Why are you in my home?

407
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,000
We're your subordinates!

408
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,700
-Go! Go!
-Let's go. Let's go.

409
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Why are you here?

410
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,500
Why am I here?

411
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,700
I'm coming back to my room.

412
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,000
Why are you here? You came to find me?

413
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,800
N-No. Hey, hey!

414
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,200
I can't get out anyways, so where would I be if not here?

415
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,500
-Hey!
-You-

416
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,400
As of now, you can't accept

417
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,800
our feelings...

418
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,800
We...have feelings?

419
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,200
Alright...

420
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,200
It's fine if we don't.

421
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I, Master Bao, don't force women.

422
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,900
Let me tell you.

423
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,800
Actually, I think you're the best man among the bandits!

424
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,600
I think you're responsible and courageous,

425
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,600
and you're also handsome! I really really admire you!

426
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,800
You really admire me?

427
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Really admire you!

428
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,200
Look! I don't talk to anyone else. I only talk to you.

429
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
Then in the future,

430
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,400
I'll come talk to you everyday.

431
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
There's no need for that...

432
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,200
Then look here...Big Brother Master Bao...

433
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,800
If you like me so much, then can you promise me something?

434
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Speak!

435
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Can you let me go? Just treat it as doing a good deed.

436
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Once I get out, I'll grab a bunch of money and come repay you!

437
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,800
I-I'll really come repay you. Alright?

438
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Alright!

439
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,700
Really?

440
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Are you trying to-

441
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
What are you doing?

442
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,600
D-Didn't you say you wouldn't force me?

443
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
Force you?

444
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
What are you going to do?

445
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
I know...

446
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
I know you aren't asleep!

447
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
S-Stop pretending.

448
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,000
He's really asleep?

449
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,200
He had the guards leave earlier...

450
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,400
Today's my chance to escape!

451
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,400
Young Master Bao!

452
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
Why is Master Bao shorter today?

453
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,300
That's right. What's going on?

454
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Stop running!

455
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Young Master Bao!

456
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,000
If you don't want to die, then stay here quietly.

457
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,700
Hurry up!

458
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,400
Young Master Bao!

459
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,800
Someone ran away wearing your clothes!

460
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,600
Are you crazy? Are you still dreaming in the middle of the night?

461
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
Really! There really was someone!

462
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
Also! Ask him! Ask him!

463
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,000
That's right! I also saw it!

464
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Someone's running over there!

465
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Go chase them! Hurry up!

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,100
Ok, ok, ok!

467
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,200
If it wasn't because of me, you would've died there! Do you know that?

468
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,000
Thank you then.

469
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,770
Do you know what sort of people are in Green Dragon Fort?

470
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,500
They're a bunch of bandits!

471
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,200
If you were caught by them, do you know what would happen?

472
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,100
Aren't you a bandit? Aren't you?

473
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,000
The Green Dragon Fort is full of traps.

474
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,600
You can't escape. Stop trying to.

475
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,400
Take off your clothes.

476
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,800
What are you looking at? Those are my clothes!

477
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,100
Take them off!

478
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'll take them off then. What are you yelling for?

479
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,200
I won't take advantage of you.

480
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll wait for you outside. Leave the clothes on the ground after you take them off.

481
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,700
I won't take them off!

482
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,400
Let's work hard everyone!

483
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
After construction's complete today,

484
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,200
I'll treat everyone to a banquet of wine and meat!

485
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
-How's that?
-Ok!

486
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,800
Thank you, Princess!

487
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,000
Who would've thought the Princess understands so much?

488
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,400
My Lord, I heard the kapok flowers are just in bloom across the yard.

489
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
Let's go take a look.

490
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,200
I am never interested in these things.

491
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Father, kapok trees are also called "hero trees", and their flowers are called "hero flowers".

492
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,000
Only such handsome and elegant plants are worthy of a hero such as Father's appreciation.

493
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
Keep talking.

494
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
It's said that Nan Jiang Island

495
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,400
once had a hero who died fighting against other clans.

496
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,700
In the past...there wasn't a wall here.

497
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,600
That's right! What's going on?

498
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,800
In response to Madam's question, this seems to be Third Young Master's yard.

499
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,000
This wall...should have been just built.

500
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
T-This Third Young Master's actions are too severe!

501
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,300
He's built a wall within the house!

502
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,800
My Lord!

503
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,600
He's not respecting you at all!

504
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
That's right, Father.

505
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
Bring me a ladder!

506
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Hurry!

507
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,400
You're not doing it right. Come down and I'll do it.

508
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,300
Please be careful then, Princess.

509
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,000
You can climb up.

510
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,000
-Father.
-Princess?

511
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,600
Why aren't you going through the entrance?

512
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
I would like to go through the entrance.

513
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
I forgot to make a door...

514
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
Mei Shiqing!

515
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,200
Who allowed you to build a wall!

516
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,130
I have my own family now and would like to live separately.

517
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,800
The Princess has agreed as well.

518
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
You-

519
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
Princess. Get out of the way.

520
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,800
Mei Shiqing, I'm telling you.

521
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,400
As long as I'm still in the Mei family, I'm still in charge!

522
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,000
Who's idea was it to build a wall?

523
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,800
My idea!

524
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,200
Ok, Mei Shiqing.

525
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Don't think just because the Princess is supporting you,

526
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,400
that I don't dare do anything to you!

527
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,200
I don't dare.

528
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,100
If you want to beat or scold me, then please feel free to, Father.

529
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,000
Mei Shiqing.

530
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,700
You don't respect me, your Father, at all now. Right?

531
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,400
Since ten years ago, you and I

532
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,200
are only father and son in name, not in feeling!

 [Under the Moon by Zhang Zining] 

535
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:56,400
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

536
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:03,000
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

537
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,400
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

538
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,800
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

539
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,000
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

540
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

541
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,100
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

542
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,800
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

543
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,600
♫ My treasured memories ♫

544
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,600
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

545
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,300
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

546
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,200
♫ It's me missing you ♫

547
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,500
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

548
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,100
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

549
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:27,600
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

550
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:34,800
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

551
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,000
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

552
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,800
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

553
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,800
♫ My treasured memories ♫

554
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,800
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

555
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,400
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

556
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,300
♫ It's me missing you ♫

557
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:13,000
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
