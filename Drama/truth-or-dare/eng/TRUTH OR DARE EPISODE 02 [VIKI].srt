Wrong Marriages

5
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,850
Your daughter being able to

6
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,550
marry Master Xiao Bao is her dumb luck.

7
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,370
If any of you dare harm my Wanzi,

8
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,270
I'll fight them at all costs!

9
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,880
Father! Don't hit my father, stop hitting him!

10
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,330
- I'll marry, I'll marry. 
- Stop!

11
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,650
If I marry him, will you let my father go?

12
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,700
Don't worry, I, Chi Feng, keep my word.

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,460
If you marry,

14
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,340
I'll set your father free immediately.

15
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,370
Wanzi! You can't marry him!

16
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,630
Father, promise me you won't gamble again.

17
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,640
Don't make me worry for you again, take care of yourself.

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,990
Wanzi.

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,240
Take her away.

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,780
Wanzi! Wanzi!

21
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,550

- Let's go.

[Ruyi Restaurant]
We haven't come in so long. This way, please.

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,540
Why are we here at Ruyi Restaurant?

27
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,860
Ruyi Restaurant is Qingzhou's largest tavern.

28
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,640
To marry up the mountain here is very lucky.

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,000
Excuse me, are you here to dine or lodge?

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,050
Lodge.

31
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,170
Alright, this way, please.

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,830
Let's go.

Princess, I think we're almost at Qingzhou.

37
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,690
Since you're so happy,

38
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,050
how about if you go marry Young Master Mei Sanshao?

39
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,330
Princess, stop teasing me already.

40
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,600
It appears we're almost at Qingzhou,

41
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,720
why isn't there anyone coming to welcome us?

42
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,780
True. How about it I tell Qiu Hua to check it out?

43
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,930
It's fine.

44
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,590
This Mei Manor is so daring.

45
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,190
How dare they be so cold-mannered towards the Princess!

46
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,520
I'm not even interested in going.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,700
Young Master, hurry and come out!

48
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,770
Today is the wedding, Young Master.

49
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,920
Young Master.

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,650
Young Master! It's time.

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,250
Young Master, Young Master!

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,510
The Lord said that the Princess has arrived in Qingzhou.

53
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,180
If you don't greet them,

54
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,170
you'll face family discipline!

55
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,000
Greet?

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,410
Family discipline?

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,800
Lord, bad news!

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,440
Don't rush, take your time.

59
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,800
The Princess didn't come to the manor straightaway,

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,740
but is staying at Ruyi Restaurant!

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,140
- What?
- What?

62
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,810
Th-this--

63
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,660
Why is the Princess staying at Ruyi Restaurant?

64
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,020
Might it be because Shiqing didn't greet her,

65
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,730
so she's mad?

66
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,710
Then, hurry and tell Shiqing to go and welcome her!

67
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,850
Third Young Master won't go no matter what.

68
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,200
This unfilial son.

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,690
Lord, with Shiqing's current condition,

70
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,900
I'm afraid it might not be best to go welcome her.

71
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,500
Father, this won't do anyways. If there's no choice left, I can go.

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,980
Shut up! Is the Princess someone for you to go welcome?

73
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,920
Juzheng, hurry and go welcome the Princess from there.

74

[Ruyi Restaurant]
- What's going on?
- How grand!

77
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,660
Sir, the Princess came to stay here so suddenly, so

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,210
we didn't have enough time to prepare.

79
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,820
If there are any inconveniences, please forgive us.

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,050
Is there anyone else here?

Please don't worry, there is one guest left who is bathing and dressing. We'll ask them to leave soon.

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,810
We must ensure the Princess' safety.

[Lin Hai]

85
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,830
Miss, do we lack courtesy for suddenly staying in an inn?

86
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,450
Courtesy?

87
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,190
I'm a clan relative of the Royal Family,

88
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,020
a Princess conferred by the Emperor himself.

89
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,010
However, that Mei Sanshao isn't even coming to greet us.

90
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,820
What does he take the Royal Family for?

91
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,760
Miss, Mei Sanshao not being able to come

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,150
might be because he's injured.

93
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,470
What happened to him?

94
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,830
Earlier, I heard from the front desk that

95
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,290
in order to fight bandits, Mei Sanshao injured his eyes.

96
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,520
Eye injury?

97
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,580
The Mei Manor servants say that unfortunately,

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,480
- he's blind. 
- Blind?

99
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,120
I, as the Princess of the Ninth Manor, have to marry a blind person?

100
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,320
Let's hurry and pack our bags to return to the manor.

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,360
You must not, you must not! This is a bestowed marriage,

102
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,120
if we return, that would be deceiving the Emperor!

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
- Everyone will face death! 
- 'Bestowed' again!

104
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Miss, please calm down. Here, have some more tea.

105
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,410
- Stop talking about it, I want to be alone for a moment. 
- Okay, okay, okay.

106
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,100
I'll leave, I'll leave.

107
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,010
Think it over, okay?

108
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,710
Gosh.

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,190

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,820
Stop yelling, I hear you. What's happening?

111
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,920
The Mei Manor Housekeeper is waiting outside.

112
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,300
A small housekeeper dares to come welcome our Princess?

113
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,790
Did you see Mei Sanshao?

114
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,140
Nope, I guess he didn't come.

115
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,970
Come on, let's go check it out.

- What's up?
- Wait, Master Xiao Bao.

118
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,510
Why are you here?

119
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,460
I am here to see my cheap future wife.

120
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,220
You're in such a rush.

121
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,490
I'm in a rush?

122
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,320
I should thank you.

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,040
Thanks for finding me a stone-breaking dragon lady.

124
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,700
What's the woman's name?

125
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,400
- Her name is Xiao Wanzi. 
- Xiao Wanzi?

126
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,030
What are we waiting for? Let's go find her.

127
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,590
Wait, Master. Look, there are guards everywhere. I was chased out.

128
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,200
She's still bathing on the second floor.

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,770
Bathing? Then, which room is she in?

130
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,730
She's upstairs in the room named

131
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,590
'Lin Hai'.

132
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,670
'Lin Hai'?

133
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,390
I'll enter from the back to check it out.

134
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,410
My Lady has thought it through?

135
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,890
Since you're all dressed up,  let's go.

136
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,200
 Who is this? The matchmaker? 

137
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
So even bandits can be this particular about marriage.

138
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,180
She's here. 
 The Princess is here.

178
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,360
I can't escape. If I run away, my dad will die.

179
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,500
These people are simply despicable! I'll help you punish them.

180
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,560
Who are you?

181
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,610
Princess, the housekeeper is here!

182
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,570
 I ran into the wrong room. 

183
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,860
 So this is the General's manor. 

184
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,180
 What should I do? 

185
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,200
 If they find out that I'm not the Princess,  they'll kill me.

186
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,450
It's time. Proceed.

187
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,420
First, bow to the heaven and earth.

188
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,550
The Princess was nervous,

189
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,300
so she forgot the etiquette.

190
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,130
Princess.

191
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,330
Bow.

192
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,730
Secondly, bow to the parents.

193
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,720
Husband and wife bow to each other.

194
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,950
The General and his wife are both here.

195
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,100
Bow.

196
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,340
The ceremony has ended. Enter the bridal chamber!

197
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,660
 Oh my god! I'm doomed! 

198
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
 What should I do? 

199
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,260
You're awake?

200
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,900
Who are you?

201
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,160
Where... is this?

202
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,930
This is the Green Dragon Fort.

203
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,870
I'm the adopted son of Nan Batian, the chief of Green Dragon Fort.

204
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,590
I'm also the third-in-command here. Moreover, I'm your future husband.

205
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,960
Green Dragon Fort?

206
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,490
My husband?

207
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,320
How could this be?

208
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,660
 Could it be that I just...? 

209
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,920
[Lin Hai]

210
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,330
I'll hide here for as long as I can.

211
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,420
[Lin Hai]

212
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,270
Who are you?

213
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,090
I... I'm your husband-to-be.

214
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,690
My husband? Isn't he blind?

215
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,100
If you dare come over, I'll call for someone! Guards!

216
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,560
 This bandit mistook me for the girl in the restaurant. 

217
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,130
 What should I do? 

218
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,660
 Should I tell him that he has the wrong person right now, and I'm actually the Princess? 

219
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,530
 No, he might kill me. 

220
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,860
 He might even do something worse to me. 

221
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,490
What's on your mind? Let me tell you, don't even think about running away.

222
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,270
You dad has already mortgaged you to me.

223
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,960
It is natural that he repays his debts.

224
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,990
But don't worry. If you stay with me, Master Bao,

225
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,040
I can guarantee that it will be a lot better than performing on the streets.

226
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,570
Right, Master Bao...

227
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,560
Then, do you know what my name is? Do you know who I am?

228
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,760
Aren't you Xiao Wanzi?

229
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,970
Could it be that my martial arts skills are too advanced, so I hit you too hard?

230
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,540
Xiao Wanzi?

231
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,170
You must be hungry after a long day.

232
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,360
I prepared a lot of delicious food. All of them are my favorites.

233
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,580
Woah!

234
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,400
What are you doing? The dishes are getting cold.

235
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,960
What are you being distracted for?

236
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,060
Then come over here yourself.

237
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,640
Look, they're all delicious. Come on, hurry up and eat.

238
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,330
You didn't see so many delicious dishes when you were performing below the mountain, right?

239
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,170
Look at how thin you are. You must be starving.

240
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,280
Don't worry. You won't ever be hungry if you stay with me.

241
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,030
I'll make you chubby.

242
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,550
I want to go home. I want to see my dad.

243
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,020
Why are you crying? This dish don't suit your tastes?

244
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,000
There's also this! Here, eat this chicken.

245
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,650
Alright, don't cry. Look,

246
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,870
besides sending you home, I'll give you anything you want.

247
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,510
Can you promise, then, promise that you won't touch me?

248
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,430
Never touch you? Impossible. Why would I bring you back here, then?

249
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:20,050
My dad told me to marry you so that you could give me babies.

250
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,550
Master Bao! Master Bao.

251
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,500
The Big Boss said to bring your bride to meet him.

252
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,540
Okay, I know. You can go.

253
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,000
[Double Happiness]

254
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,200
Please don't take off the veil!

255
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
If you take it off, I'm finished!

256
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
Someone will believe me if I say there's been a mistake, right?

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,800
What if they don't believe me?

258
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,630
What if I get captured and beheaded?

259
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
What are you doing?

260
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,200
What? Princess, are you looking down on a blind man like me?

261
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,700
He really is blind? Was he already blind when I last saw him?

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
What are you doing? What are you doing?

263
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,300
I...! I'm telling you, this is a misunderstanding!

264
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,600
I...didn't want to marry.

265
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
You didn't want to marry?

266
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
I was forced!

267
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
No no.

268
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,400
I...I don't know how I was somehow delivered here.

269
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,000
The emperor decreed this marriage. No one can avoid it.

270
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,400
Since neither of us wanted to marry, then let us steer clear of each other.

271
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
We'll each stick to our own place.

272
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,400
No...! We've already come to this step. How will we stick to our own place?

273
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,800
We are married in name, but we will not consummate it.

274
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,400
That means you won't touch me?

275
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,800
What? Princess, you want to get married now?

276
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
No no no! I agree, I agree!

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
-I agree! I agree!
-Excellent!

278
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,900
I've never seen such a narcissist. 

279
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,600
Once I'm full and energetic tomorrow, I'll run away!

280
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
That's not right.

281
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Isn't he blind? I can run away right now!

282
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,200
What? You want to run away?

283
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,200
You ate too much. No matter how light your footsteps are, I can hear you.

284
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Besides, today is our wedding.

285
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,000
It's not safe for the bride to run around everywhere.

286
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,700
Our security here is very tight.

287
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,200
What are you doing? What are you doing?

288
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Sleeping.

289
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,100
If you sleep in the bed, where am I sleeping?

290
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,200
If you want to sleep in the bed too, I don't mind.

291
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
I mind!

292
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,300
I...!

293
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,100
This princess is beautiful and esteemed!

294
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,000
You can't take advantage of me!

295
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Then do as you'd like.

296
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Do as I'd like?

297
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Are you human?

298
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
You are a man!

299
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,000
How could you take over the entire bed?

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
This is my bed.

301
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,500
Your blankets are over there. Go get it yourself.

302
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Fine.

303
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Since you are a blind man

304
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
blind man,

305
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,400
I won't hold this against you!

306
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm magnanimous! I can sleep anywhere!

307
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,400
Oh no.

308
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,930
Godfather! We're here!

309
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Xiao Bao, look at you.

310
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,000
You carried your wife all the way here before you even got married!

311
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,500
I was in a rush! I wanted to see what my wife looked like!

312
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
Are you satisfied?

313
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,200
Godfather! I am too satisfied! This is all thanks to Master Wu.

314
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,410
Satisfied?

315
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,500
Bride.

316
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,400
Lift up your head, let me take a look.

317
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Wanzi! Lift up your head! Godfather wants to see you.

318
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,480
Hurry up!

319
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
Godfather?

320
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Chief?

321
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,200
Father?

322
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
Chief?

323
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Beautiful.

324
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,300
This girl is beautiful!

325
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,590
Lady.

326
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,580
This brat carried you all the way up the mountain.

327
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,600
Did he scare you?

328
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,800
I was scared.

329
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,300
He really doesn't know how to be tender towards women.

330
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,800
Godfather!

331
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
We already made up!

332
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,000
Who made up with you?

333
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,800
Give me some face in front of Godfather!

334
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
Xiao Bao.

335
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,300
You are so lucky!

336
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,400
Godfather picked a good lady for me!

337
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,710
Get up!

338
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,200
This is the girl?

339
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
If you are getting married, you have to get my permission first!

340
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,200
Why should I tell you? Why do I need your permission?

341
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
I-!

342
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,300
Father!

343
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
You are marrying this woman, right?

344
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,800
Don't even think of living well if you marry her!

345
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,400
-What does it have to do with you?
-I-!

346
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,700
This temper of mine!

347
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,800
Xiao Bao!

348
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,900
Hurry and go! Go!

349
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,600
-Go!
-Nan Xiang!
-Father!

350
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,800
Why are you doing this?

351
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,000
I-!

352
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
What is so great about Xiao Bao? He's not loyal, right?

353
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,900
Father, I just like him, I think he's great!

354
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,600
Are you my father?

355
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,800
Xiao Bao is going to get married, are you really my father?

356
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,400
I promise you!

357
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I will definitely deal with that brat Xiao Bao for you, alright?

358
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,800
No!

359
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,200
What use is that? He's still going to get married!

360
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
-Father!
-Fine!

361
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,400
I promise you. I will give you a satisfactory answer, alright?

362
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Go back first, alright? I have something to discuss with Old Wu.

363
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,800
-You sure?
-I'm sure. Hurry and go back.

364
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,600
Old Wu.

365
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,700
Come.

366
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
What is it, Chief?

367
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,200
You unreliable wicked man.

368
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,500
You told me she breaks slabs of rock on top of her chest! And she looks like that??

369
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,000
Why didn't you bring me a beautiful wife like that?

370
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Chief!

371
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,800
This is my first time seeing her too! Who knew she doesn't look that bad?

372
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,700
You're still saying that?

373
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,000
Damn!

374
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,460
Here, have a seat.

375
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Alright, stop with the long face already.

376
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,600
Don't worry.

377
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,270
Nan Xiang has no bad intentions, you'll get used to her in the future.

378
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,790
What future do I have with you?

379
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,270
Now that I'm full, I'm actually kind of tired.

380
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,380
Wife, let's go sleep. Come on.

381
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,510
Hold on, who are you calling wife?

382
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm so tired.

383
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,650
What are you doing?

384
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,250
Taking my shoes off to go to bed.

385
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,270
Wait, if you're sleeping here, then where do I sleep?

386
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,650
Do you want to sleep on the left or right side? Your choice.

387
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,600
You scoundrel...get out of here immediately!

388
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,850
Then, where am I supposed to sleep?

389
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,500
You can go sleep wherever. But, if you don't get out of here,

390
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,840
- I'll die in front of you. 
- Don't!

391
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,550
Fine, fine, fine! I'll leave.

392
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,450
- Are you satisfied if I leave? 
- I'm dead.

393
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,210
Well, Master Bao.

394
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,500
How come you aren't going to the bridal chamber at night?

395
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,790
One hour in a spring night is worth a thousand pieces of gold. 
(A romantic night is priceless.)

396
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,630
A thousand pieces of gold my head!

397
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,550
Although we are bandits,

398
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,240
we still have to be cultured.

399
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,740
How could we consummate when we're not yet married?

400
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,070
Also, go get me some items for women tomorrow.

401
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,740
Like lipstick, foundation, and blush, got it?

402
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,350
Then, stay here and keep watch. If you don't, then you'll be responsible.

403
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,060
Okay.

404
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,460
I have to hurry and think of a way to escape.

405
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,830
It seems Master Xiao Bao actually likes me. 

406
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,540
I might possibly be able to use him to escape. 

407
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,810
No...

408
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,930
Young Master, I apologize for the wait.

409
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,210
What have you found?

410
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,390
A few days ago, a lunatic appeared on the Qingzhou streets.

411
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,620
When he was spewing nonsense, he mentioned the murder of Madam Mei.

412
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,710
So, I ordered him to be tied up.

413
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,890
What is his background?

414
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,000
He is Chen Laodian from Qingzhou.

415
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,680
Has a crazy personality and is evil.

416
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,700
Ten years ago, he disappeared from here.

417
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,420
Recently, he's wandered back to Qingzhou.

418
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,280
Now, he's completely insane.

419
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,570
Without family or friends,

420
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,300
he can only survive on begging.

421
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,610
What else did you find out?

422
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,710
He also mentioned Lai Laobao from the beggar gang.

423
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,830
He specializes in finding people and building connections.

424
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,240
I found out that the year when madam was killed.

425
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,080
He was looking for assassins from the underworld sects.

426
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,390
Where is he now?

427
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,110
It is said he will appear at the shed next to the Earth Temple.

428
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,850
I've already sent someone to keep an eye out.

429
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,400
You must bring him back alive to me.

430
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,740
Yes.

431
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,230
I see.

432
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,900
Night-Spirited Hero.

433
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,700
We will uphold justice together.

434
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,470
Together.
