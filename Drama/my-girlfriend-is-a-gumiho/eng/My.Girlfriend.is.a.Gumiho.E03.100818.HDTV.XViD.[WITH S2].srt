3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,170
Noona! Noona!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,040
No!

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,700
She's not my girlfriend!

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,410
Please don't misunderstand.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,110
I don't have that type of relationship
with her.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,920
A situation suddenly cropped up.
So that's why we're temporarily together.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,980
Situation?

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,850
What kind of situation?

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,170
That...

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,400
It's not very convenient to say.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,030
Something inconvenient to say about a
man-woman relationship, isn't that obvious?

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,460
I already said it's not like that!

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,580
Alright, Dae Woong.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,680
If it's inconvenient to say, I don't think
it's necessary for me to hear.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,110
You and I, don't have a special
relationship anyway.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,010
Don't make your girlfriend misunderstand.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,650
I'm leaving.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,320
Noona!

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,690
This is all because of you!

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,430
Noona!

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>Noona!</i>

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,090
Noona, don't leave!
Noona!

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,300
Listen to my explanation.

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,890
You didn't call me these past few days,
not even sending a text message.

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,340
Because you've been so busy dating
a girl like that?

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,390
We're seriously not dating.

29
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,140
- Then why are you together?
- She insists on following me!

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,970
A few days ago, my grandfather and I
argued about the question of my future.

31
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,660
I wanted to relax for a bit,
so I went to the countryside.

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,990
I caused some troubles for her there.

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,060
So she ended up going as far as
following me to Seoul.

34
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,040
Then, did she run away from home?

35
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,290
Ran away from home?

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,980
Oh, it could count as running
away from home.

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,710
Her grandmother is very intimidating.

38
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,460
But, how can you have this type
of girl at your side?

39
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,350
She has nowhere to go and
doesn't know anybody.

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,310
Also, I truly did cause some trouble
for her.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,170
She's only sticking to your side because
she sees you as a kind-hearted person.

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,200
What about your grandfather and aunt?
They didn't scold you?

43
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,970
Huh?

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,250
Oh... I did get scolded.

45
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,710
Dae Woong...

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,550
Did you get hurt?

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,450
Is it really painful?

48
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,770
It's nothing, it doesn't matter.

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,010
Worrying about me, that's more like you.

50
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,670
There's a bit of value to being injured.

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,560
<i>That Dae Woong, seriously!</i>

52
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,360
Leaving and not caring for his girlfriend,
what is he doing?

53
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,670
Girlfriend...

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,120
Does it mean a friend one wants
as a mate?

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,340
Yes, it's like that.

56
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,220
Then, saying that I'm not his girlfriend

57
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,220
means that he doesn't want me
as a mate?

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,370
I didn't follow him here because
I wanted him as my mate.

59
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,260
Mi Ho, you can't just sit here
like this and not care.

60
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,730
You're just going to let Dae Woong
get away with it?

61
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,560
Why?

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,150
Actually...

63
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,700
Dae Woong really liked her before.

64
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,070
Everyone thought she would become
his girlfriend.

65
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,850
Girlfriend?

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,440
Then, Dae Woong wants that woman
as a mate?

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,800
Oh, that won't do!
It'll cause trouble!

68
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,580
That's right! The one two-timing
should get a good punishment.

69
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,930
Fighting!

70
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,700
Have you eaten yet? Let's go eat together.

71
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,750
Okay.

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,540
But...

73
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,050
What about her?

74
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,930
Her?

75
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,810
I don't like eating with a stranger.

76
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,120
Really?

77
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay, I get it.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,830
I'll go talk to her. Wait for me.

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,960
Hey, I'm going to go eat with her.

80
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,540
Tell Byung Soo to go eat at
the fried chicken chain store.

81
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,320
No need for chicken.

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,110
Do you like her?

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,510
What?

84
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,770
What does that have to do with you?

85
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,170
Are you going to mate with her?

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,190
Mate?

87
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,640
Dae Woong!

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,220
Hurry up!

89
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes.

90
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,660
Mate?

91
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,810
- Why are you saying such crude things?
- Humans are crude.

92
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,150
Those are apes.

93
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,590
Whether it's cows,

94
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,460
chickens or humans, we're all
counted in the same food chain,

95
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,200
but humans are different from
those animals.

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,530
So that means...

97
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,290
- You're not going to mate with her?
- Who said I'm not going to?

98
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,460
Whatever I do? What does that have
to do with you?

99
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,190
You haven't started liking me and
now you're jealous, have you?

100
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,990
A gumiho really cares about a wide
variety of matters.

101
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,720
I saw that you're a person and thought
to take care of you.

102
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,750
It seems wrong now, right?

103
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,470
I was wrong on the last sentence I said.
I'll punish myself.

104
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,200
I only cared because of my bead.

105
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,640
Bead?

106
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,890
- The one inside here?
- You can't wear it and

107
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,520
share the energy with another woman.

108
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,380
It will damage my bead.

109
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
Dae Woong!

110
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,420
What are you doing?

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,150
Noona, wait a moment!

112
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,880
Sharing the aura with another person...

113
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,300
Does it mean breathing in each
other's breath,

114
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,110
that kind of intimacy...

115
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,440
Mating.

116
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,860
I understand now!

117
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,000
That won't happen, I'll keep it in mind.

118
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,480
No, I can't let you go.

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,930
I saw the way you treat her,

120
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,550
not just your energy, you could even
give her your entire soul.

121
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,598
Hey, how can eating a meal in broad daylight

122
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,970
be interpreted as some energy sharing
or mating?

123
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,130
I'll be beside you keeping watch.
I'll go with you.

124
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,530
You can't!

125
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,520
She's already misunderstanding,
how am I supposed to take you along?

126
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,260
- You definitely can't!
- Then don't go.

127
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,490
- What if I insist on going?
- If you insist...

128
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,670
then give me back my bead!

129
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,830
Didn't you say that if it's taken away,
I'll die?

130
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,320
And you want it back?

131
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,950
I have to protect my bead.

132
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,310
- You're going to let me die?
- Yeah.

133
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,120
If you insist on going,
then you have to die.

134
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,180
Dae Woong!

135
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,980
Don't bother with her.
Come quickly!

136
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,970
Dae Woong, don't go to her.

137
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,920
Oh! Noona!

138
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:12,970
Noona!

139
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,100
<i>Noona!</i>

140
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,570
Noona!

141
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,280
Noona! Wait up!

142
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,570
Noona! Wait for me!

143
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,980
Let me explain! Noona!

144
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,050
Noona!

145
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,930
Noona!

146
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,890
Noona!

147
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,720
What? I chased after her all the way here,
are you going to kill me?

148
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,450
You didn't go with her.

149
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,220
You're not even afraid of death, following
her here, but she totally disregarded you.

150
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,290
Yes, it's really great.

151
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,560
She even waited for me.
If I then said that I couldn't go,

152
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,720
it'd definitely be even more shameful.

153
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,510
Even if she did wait for you,
you weren't planning on going, right?

154
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,260
Yes, even she's the person I like,

155
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,690
I didn't have the courage to risk death
and go eat with her, okay?

156
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,700
I did it to save you.

157
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,040
I don't want you to die,

158
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,850
that's why I gave you my most
precious bead.

159
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,350
<i>How come you only know how to get angry
at me?</i>

160
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,400
I'm like this because I'm ashamed and sad.

161
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,610
I'm so heartbroken that not even
your bead can cure it.

162
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,300
Please, don't stay too close to me,
let me be alone.

163
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,800
Heartbroken?

164
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,780
I'm about to die of hunger.

165
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,910
If I make him buy meat,
he'll get angry again, right?

166
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
Is he like this because he doesn't want
to buy me meat?

167
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm about to die of hunger and
he's still not buying meat for me.

168
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,790
Yes, Father.

169
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,020
I'm at the place where Dae Woong
is staying.

170
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,260
I'll pack his bags and bring him back home.

171
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,580
Action School?

172
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,140
The school even teaches fighting skills?

173
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,940
One, two, three.

174
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,530
Jump!

175
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,670
Everybody jump!

176
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,140
Jump!

177
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,040
That's right.

178
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,110
The effect of the script revision
isn't bad this time.

179
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,180
Especially...

180
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,750
Yes...

181
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,080
This scene.

182
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,090
This scene...

183
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,220
I can already see a picture of it
in my head.

184
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,440
Under the moonlight,

185
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,510
sword in hand.

186
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,500
Leaving the ground...

187
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,980
One flip... no, two flips.

188
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,350
Carefully performing the third flip.

189
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,500
After the flips, landing on the
ground gracefully.

190
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,410
Then pointing the sword at the
woman's neck.

191
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,530
The woman, with boiling hot blood,
flowing on me...

192
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,650
Director Ban.

193
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,530
Yes?

194
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,460
This drama is supposed to be a
beautiful and affectionate drama.

195
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,630
<i>Won't that be too much?</i>

196
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,860
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

197
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,660
you know when Chow Yun Fat fires a gun?

198
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,130
Why is it necessary, you say?

199
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,260
Why did he flip two times to the side,

200
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,300
just to fire the gun?

201
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,060
In here, there's a very important
meaning to life.

202
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,150
<i>And that is, to be graceful.</i>

203
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,290
With style. With style.

204
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,320
Have to be graceful even when firing
a gun.

205
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,760
Have to be graceful as well during
a sword fight.

206
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,830
That's what my class is striving
to achieve,

207
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,070
real action.

208
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,470
Ah, yes.

209
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,450
I'm just here to demonstrate for you.

210
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,890
Not me, Doek Man.

211
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,820
<i>- Yes.
- Fly a little bit today.</i>

212
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,080
Oh my, how can I get up to the attic?

213
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,560
This smell of perspiration...

214
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,150
<i>- Check carefully, get ready.
- Yes.</i>

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
Hey, Doek Man.

216
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,630
You've seen "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon", right?

217
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,350
Walk, skimming the water's surface,
do the actions to warm up.

218
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,190
I understand.

219
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,240
Now... Action!

220
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,480
Lighter, lighter, okay!

221
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,420
This time, leave the ground softly
into the air.

222
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,050
Flip three times. After completion,
push off the ground hard.

223
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,870
Jump forward towards the moon.

224
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,380
Okay.
Everybody, pay attention.

225
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,770
Now...

226
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,900
Action!

227
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,310
That's right, one, two, three.

228
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,860
Excuse me, how do I get to the attic?
Omo, omo!

229
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,960
No!

230
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,930
Are you all right?

231
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,620
It's you...

232
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,300
It's you...

233
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,350
My daughter said that a friend of hers
is living here.

234
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,450
Turns out, it's your nephew.

235
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,250
If Dae Woong's friend is your daughter,

236
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,820
then the young girl I saw at the
department store was your daughter?

237
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,430
Yes.

238
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,850
She has no mother.

239
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,080
I brought her up myself.

240
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,850
The child has been pampered and spoiled.

241
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,640
By yourself?

242
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,250
Then that means you're single?

243
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,460
You said that you're this action school's
martial arts director?

244
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,700
Just now, we just finished filming that part
of the drama that gets high TV ratings?

245
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,690
Right now, we're preparing for my movie.

246
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,150
When the movie production is complete,
I'll advertise it on my blog for you.

247
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,260
Blog?

248
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,260
Yes...

249
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,510
It's a blog where I write about topics
like poetry, music, and love.

250
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,990
Poetry, poop, love..

251
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,450
It's poetry, music, and love.

252
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,630
Ah, poetry, music, love.

253
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,690
I'm sorry, I made a very smelly mistake.

254
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,730
Don't say it like that, the mistakes
have all been made by me.

255
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,250
You've already saved me three times.

256
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:07,240
Everybody says that the third time
really is fate.

257
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,980
Then, have a pleasant meeting with
your nephew before you go.

258
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,250
So he's actually single! Single! Single!

259
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,810
Director Ban, the other half of my life!

260
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,400
She has a husband...

261
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,040
Did you forget?

262
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,940
What?

263
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,530
Let Dae Woong stay there?

264
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,870
Yes, you shouldn't forcibly
bring him in.

265
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,180
Instead, I'll keep a hawk's eye on him.

266
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,640
I will go see him every day.

267
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,970
I knew you'd give in like this,
I'll go bring him back.

268
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,740
You can't, Father!
You have to let him stay there.

269
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,170
He can't. Let's go.
You lead the way.

270
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,090
Father! If you bring Dae Woong back,
what excuse would I have to go see him?

271
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,370
What?

272
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,380
You think finding someone who pleases me
is that easy?

273
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,900
Pleases you? Who?

274
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,730
Eh?

275
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,960
Is she that great?

276
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,590
The girl that Dae Woong is with now,

277
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,570
do you really like her?

278
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,860
Well...

279
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,220
Pretty good. I'm really pleased.

280
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,370
Really?

281
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,210
So, Father, just let Dae Woong stay there,
and bear it a bit longer.

282
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,310
I... I will decide on what to do.

283
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,570
Then go ahead and do that.

284
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,080
I say, when you go,

285
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,620
buy some of those mangoes and kiwis
that Dae Woong loves.

286
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,850
All right, I will buy some fruit.

287
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,160
And make some hearts for him.

288
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,740
Our Min Sook is a child who has a bad temper
and always makes people worry.

289
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:31,070
Dae Woong is also a child with a rotten
temper and can never tolerate anyone else.

290
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,480
Seems like that girl is really great.

291
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,830
The picture looks too real.
I want to eat it even more.

292
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,380
If the taste was exactly the same,
it'd be so much better.

293
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,500
I really want to eat.

294
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,260
Woong!

295
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,130
<i>Noona, you have to accept my apology.</i>

296
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,100
<i>You will accept it, right?</i>

297
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,420
You absolutely have to say you accept it.

298
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,040
My baby, Mommy's going to bite you!

299
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,540
A bite on the forehead,
also a bite on the hand.

300
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,150
Why does she want to eat her own child?

301
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,610
<i>Oh, hello?</i>

302
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,510
I'm not going to eat you.

303
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,260
Then should I try eating humans?

304
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,680
What are you doing?

305
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,790
What's the matter?

306
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,590
Oh damn!

307
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,760
Please stop the bus!

308
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,510
Hey...

309
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,330
- What were you doing?
- What did I do?

310
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,560
- You can't eat a child even if you're
hungry! - I didn't want to eat her!

311
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,951
You were clearly biting that child's finger!

312
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:18,610
Still saying you didn't want to eat her?

313
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,760
I was just copying what her mother did.

314
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,720
A mother eating her own child?
What nonsense is that?

315
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,870
"My baby, Mommy's going to bite you."

316
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,990
"A bite on the forehead."
That's what she did!

317
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,670
"My baby..."?

318
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,640
So that was it?

319
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,880
I said before that I don't eat humans.

320
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,549
If I have to eat anything because
I'm hungry,

321
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,870
would I eat that little child?
I'd eat you!

322
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,590
Me?

323
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,440
Okay, as long as you say you won't eat.

324
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,914
<i>Now what? Because of you,
we got off the bus for nothing,</i>

325
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,660
and we have no money to begin with!

326
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,850
Oh! My cell phone!

327
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,990
Ah, I'm about to go crazy!

328
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,430
Noona might give me a call.
I have to find it quickly!

329
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,940
I can't even see the bus.

330
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,840
Because of you, I became distracted
and left my cell phone on the bus.

331
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,650
I'm sorry, can I borrow your cell phone?

332
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:34,070
I'm sorry, I left my cell phone
on the bus, can I borrow yours?

333
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,830
I hope the person who finds it will answer.

334
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,900
Found it!

335
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,170
Student, I have to go.

336
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,090
Let me make one more call. I'm sorry.

337
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,450
Ah, someone, please answer.

338
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,360
He... Hello?

339
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,180
Hello? Hello?

340
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,790
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

341
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,710
Are you Mi Ho?
How could it be you who picked up?

342
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,600
I ran over and found it!

343
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,610
- You chased the bus to find it?
- Yes.

344
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,090
Didn't I mention that I'm really fast?

345
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,880
Yes, very fast.

346
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,500
It came!

347
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,790
<i>Your apology, I only accept it
a little bit.</i>

348
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,190
Oh, just in time.

349
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,600
Dae Woong.

350
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,671
This time, you're happy because
of me, right?

351
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:49,689
Huh?

352
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,670
Yes, you found it. I'm very happy.

353
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,400
But, what's wrong with you?

354
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,590
I'm like this because I ran too fast
and too far.

355
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,260
When you run too much, you also
become out of breath and sweat?

356
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,980
Yes, because I don't have the
bead right now.

357
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,350
Didn't I give it to you?

358
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,100
This seems to be very important to you.

359
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,480
I've already said multiple times
that it's important.

360
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,130
Something you can't see or feel,
how can I understand even if you explain.

361
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,550
W... What are you doing?

362
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,530
Don't move.

363
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,530
Wah, it's amazing.

364
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,780
Just then, I felt that time and space
were completely different.

365
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,530
You and I are indeed different life forms.

366
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,510
The most valuable part of me, is in there.

367
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,150
You have to promise me that you
won't damage it.

368
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,000
Okay, I should promise you.

369
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,370
Cheers!

370
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:30,300
Dae Woong, drink one glass.
Come quickly.

371
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,770
Dae Woong sunbae!

372
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,330
The bar is too much fun! Come quickly!

373
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,300
Dae Woong! We're going to drive
to the east sea!

374
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,730
Let's go together!

375
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,220
My life has completely disappeared.

376
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,400
As long as she's here,
I can't do anything, nothing at all.

377
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,490
<i>I can't meet Noona either.</i>

378
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,530
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

379
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,450
<i>Dae Woong?</i>

380
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,390
Noona?

381
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,800
<i>Dae Woong.</i>

382
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,940
<i>I'm here, come out.</i>

383
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,900
Noona!

384
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,060
When I left like that today,
did I hurt your feelings?

385
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,790
I'm all right.

386
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,300
It's dangerous here,
let's go somewhere else.

387
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,860
Dae Woong...

388
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,520
You... you like me, right?

389
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,310
Noona...

390
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,680
If you do, just say it out loud.

391
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,878
I want to confess,

392
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:21,070
but if I say it out loud, I'd want to
hold your hands...

393
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,070
And I'd want a hug.

394
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,400
What else?

395
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,220
And then is...

396
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,360
But the situation doesn't allow this.

397
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,290
We... can't...

398
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,920
I told you that you can't!

399
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,870
You can't even last this little amount
of time? So in a hurry to mate?

400
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,210
I thought that something wasn't right...

401
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,990
Not only wanting to mate,
but also breaking your promise.

402
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,590
I won't dare, it won't happen again!

403
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,870
It definitely won't.

404
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,460
Oh, it was a dream.

405
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,010
Scared me to death.

406
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,860
- Woong!
- Aaaah!

407
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,060
If you collect ten of these,
you get one free, right?

408
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,630
I found one down there!

409
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,010
Collect two more, next time
we can eat one for free!

410
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,080
I'll go search some more!

411
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,160
I wonder how many pieces she'll collect
during the period she stays at my side.

412
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,360
I hope it doesn't exceed 30 pieces.

413
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,073
What exactly does Cha Dae Woong like
about that Mi Ho?

414
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,010
She's pretty.

415
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,340
Pretty?

416
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,070
Of course you are more beautiful
in my eyes.

417
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,310
What use is that?
Cha Dae Woong still likes that Mi Ho.

418
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,280
Seon Nyeo...

419
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,620
It could be said that Dae Woong
is now a woman's husband.

420
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,800
They're already living together.

421
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,790
Go over there immediately!
And kick her out.

422
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,040
Hey, endure it.

423
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,030
Dae Woong has an important
audition tomorrow.

424
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,940
For these next two days, just endure it.

425
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,530
Go immediately!

426
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,580
I will get my dad to eliminate
Cha Dae Woong!

427
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,420
Just endure it!
Endure it.

428
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,220
Endure it.

429
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,990
Only if Dae Woong gets through,
will he be able to support Mi Ho.

430
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,330
If I knew that Cha Dae Woong was
that shallow earlier,

431
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,480
I should have acted earlier.

432
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,290
I thought it'd be extremely difficult,
I didn't even had a chance to challenge.

433
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,210
Seon Nyeo, why don't you challenge me?

434
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,130
I'm very easy.

435
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,200
As soon as one finger presses down
gently, I will fall limply.

436
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,160
Ah, my head.

437
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,840
Seon Nyeo, you can't fall down first.

438
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,610
Your father will beat me to death.

439
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,377
Whoever touches one hair on my daughter,

440
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:02,566
don't ever think about holding
chopsticks again.

441
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,050
Bastard.

442
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,060
I definitely won't let you get away
with it.

443
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,860
Miss! Are you alright?

444
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,170
It was clearly here.

445
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,630
Definitely...

446
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,630
She definitely came this way.

447
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,560
Found it!

448
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,770
That should be nine now.

449
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,920
Just need one last one,

450
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,450
then we can exchange them for chicken.

451
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,130
What did I see just now?

452
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,810
Jumped up from here,

453
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,260
flew up to there with nothing at all.

454
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,440
This... How is this possible?

455
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,020
Finally, I've seen what I've hoped for
in my dreams...

456
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,870
Real action.

457
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,890
Finally, I met a person who can achieve
my dreams.

458
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,110
A woman who can complete real action.

459
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,087
Director,

460
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:56,230
if you saw a woman wearing a white dress
with long hair in the middle of night...

461
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,960
You think I'm possessed by a ghost?

462
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,740
Look into my eyes.

463
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,250
Do my eyes look like I'm possessed by
a ghost?

464
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,460
But, seeing her wear a white dress
like a nightgown,

465
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,590
she definitely must live in
this neighborhood.

466
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,650
Ah, I've collected nine.

467
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,730
Collecting ten is really not an easy task.

468
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,970
What should I wear to the audition?

469
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,310
Wearing this isn't bad; this one
isn't bad either.

470
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,360
I think this one is better.

471
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,960
What are you doing?

472
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,190
I'm going some place, just picking
out what to wear.

473
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,320
You think this one is good?

474
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,730
- I like this one.
- Really?

475
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:15,150
- Does this one look good?
- Yes, this is the color of cows.

476
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,040
Color of cows?

477
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,260
Then this is the color of pigs,
and this is the color of chickens?

478
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,040
Oh, that's right.

479
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,670
Cow, pig, chicken.

480
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,560
Number one, number two, number three.

481
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,700
No use asking you.

482
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,520
Saying they're cow, pig and chicken.

483
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,710
I won't wear them,
I won't wear any of them.

484
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,440
Why? Just wear the cow-colored one.

485
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,740
I'll just wear green, so you don't
develop an appetite. Oh my...

486
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,470
They say that it's at the top of
this building.

487
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,610
Isn't that just a storage room?

488
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,300
This kind of place, it's probably stuffy
and small.

489
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:10,150
He doesn't even have much money,
how does he live?

490
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,140
Ah, seriously.

491
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,335
I will definitely pass the audition.

492
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:25,530
This way I can earn money to buy you
some meat to eat.

493
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,550
Mmm.

494
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,304
Although the audition is for my dreams...

495
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:31,780
Right now, our survival also
depends on it.

496
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,600
Mmm.

497
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,270
In order to support you,
I will put in my best effort.

498
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,050
- So you have to cooperate with me as well.
- Mmm.

499
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,500
Not hesitating about his life to
earn money and support another person.

500
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,980
Surprisingly, that guy is capable of
saying something like that.

501
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,680
This isn't the same guy I raised
for 20 years.

502
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,200
You're really enjoying that.

503
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,740
If you want to become an adult,
you have to have ideals, Dae Woong.

504
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,330
- What do you want to become in the future?
- Isn't Grandpa really wealthy?

505
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,510
I want to be a person who eats, drinks
and plays for my entire life.

506
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,650
What?

507
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,280
Is that right?

508
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,790
Father, he's still young.

509
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,390
He'll understand better when he's older.

510
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,170
Hey, Cha Dae Woong.

511
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,130
You're not attending class,
why did you come to this place?

512
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,170
What exactly do you want to do?

513
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,730
Doesn't Grandpa have large estates?

514
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,900
- Why don't you build billiard rooms there?
- What?!

515
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,880
You... you...

516
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,950
Father!

517
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,620
He's going through a rebellious stage.

518
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,080
He'll be better once this period passes.

519
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,090
The time when you finally understand
should be now.

520
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,350
So what? What are you going to do?

521
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,090
Grandpa, open an agency for me, okay?

522
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,420
I want to become a celebrity.

523
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,370
He contacted me to say that he wants
to become a celebrity.

524
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,930
This is my business card.

525
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,390
Here's one for the lovely lady as well.

526
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,640
<i>No Brake Entertainment
CEO Hahn Min Kwan</i>

527
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,890
There's no hope left for you anymore.
No hope for you to become a decent adult.

528
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,390
<i>Father...</i>

529
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,050
I don't know either.

530
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,450
I don't want to go through hardships.
I want to be successful immediately.

531
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,150
Grandpa, you have a lot of money.

532
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,670
Please make it happen.

533
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,590
The Dae Woong who never
thinks of hardships...

534
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,610
To solve the problem of feeding and
clothing you, I will try hard and work well.

535
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,880
Yes!

536
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,530
Meeting a woman can really make him
thoroughly remold himself.

537
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,640
Oh, Woong.

538
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,800
- I think someone's talking about you.
- Talking about me?

539
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,880
Saying what?

540
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,220
<i>Our Dae Woong has high prospects,</i>

541
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,770
<i>has responsibilities, and an honest
side to him.</i>

542
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,520
Making people proud of him.

543
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,920
Really?

544
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,040
Then that's definitely not me.
Let's go.

545
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,870
Mmm.

546
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,940
Perfect!

547
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,160
These are the files of the supporting roles
for both genders for the audition today.

548
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,450
For the female supporting role of
Lady Seol Won, please consider Eun Hae In.

549
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,460
They say that she's the new investment
for many advertisements.

550
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,830
Director!

551
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,890
<i>You wouldn't let a new person take the
leading role, right?</i>

552
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,270
Real action.

553
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,510
My d...

554
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,670
<i>dream.</i>

555
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,615
Before the casting,

556
00:41:06,616 --> 00:41:09,530
why don't you pay a visit to the film
company's representative by yourself?

557
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,680
So...

558
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,270
Who's been picked as the female
leading role?

559
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,980
It should be a big celebrity.

560
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,970
Ah, I think they said it might be
Kim Hee Joong.

561
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,850
Really?

562
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,390
The role you're auditioning for
is very important too.

563
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,610
The director stresses a lot about
the action parts.

564
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,380
You have to be both strong
and energetic. Understand?

565
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,210
- Can you make my makeup look smokier?
- Smokier?

566
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,710
Yes, it'll look better that way.
Smokey, yes.

567
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,440
Come quickly, hurry!

568
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,470
- Wait a moment.
- Okay.

569
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,830
Director is considering using
a new actor as the female lead?

570
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,050
He must be possessed by something.

571
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,590
He's going on about long hair,
white dress, real action.

572
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,830
I don't know either.

573
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,950
Let's go.

574
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,570
Manager Moon, do I have a white dress
in my wardrobe?

575
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,850
Dress? No dresses were prepared.

576
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,490
I want to change my hairstyle
and change my outfit too.

577
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,380
Oh, it's the sight-seeing tour boat.

578
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,050
At this time last year, I was eating
with my friends on that boat.

579
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,940
That time was really great.

580
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,840
What's wrong?

581
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,050
Water...

582
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,860
I don't like passing by big areas
of water.

583
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:51,253
Ah, you said that you were afraid of
water because you don't have the bead.

584
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,965
If you're scared,
the bead is right here so...

585
00:43:26,966 --> 00:43:29,730
until we get past the river,
endure it like this.

586
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,950
Woong...

587
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,820
What is a couple?

588
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,330
Why?

589
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,740
They are saying that we're a couple.

590
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,350
Who said these anger-making words?

591
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,640
So it's actually not something good.

592
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,110
- It's too hot. Let's be farther apart.
- Mmm.

593
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,550
It really is extremely hot.

594
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,540
Oh my! This weather will cool off
as soon as it rains.

595
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,410
On a clear day like this,
if you want it to rain,

596
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,260
- you'll have to make me cry first.
- What?

597
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,230
It's called a "fox rain" when it rains
on a clear day because

598
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:45,030
it rains when I cry.
- Fox rain*? [*Korean for sun shower]

599
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,180
I think I've heard of it somewhere before.

600
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,810
- You cry too?
- Yes.

601
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,380
When I'm sad, my tears will fall.

602
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,170
If it rains on a clear day,
that means I'm crying because I'm sad.

603
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,320
Then when you're sad,
give the weather office a call

604
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,167
so that I can prepare an umbrella.

605
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,040
Woong...

606
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,150
I'm about to be sad right now.

607
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,830
My stomach is starving.

608
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,040
I don't have an umbrella so
it won't do if it rains.

609
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,860
Let's eat before we go.

610
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,910
Wow!

611
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,420
There's so much! Dae Woong!

612
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,470
<i>There's cow, there's pig and
there's chicken!</i>

613
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,010
The agency where we're going to
audition is nearby.

614
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,540
If we can finish eating, then go
there, the timing will be perfect.

615
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,850
She's taking it without even saying
anything. Then I want one too!

616
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,370
Hey, you can't.

617
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,740
Let go, quickly.

618
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,150
Why?

619
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,930
Do you see over there?

620
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,930
You have to pay money when
you're going through there.

621
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,340
Or you have to have this.
Otherwise you can't get out.

622
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,140
- Then set up one of those for me too.
- I can't.

623
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,770
You don't have any credit.

624
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,930
Do you have a bank account? No.
Do you have a job? No.

625
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,770
So you can't apply for this.

626
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,950
Then let's use yours.

627
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,720
This can't be used, my credit card's gone.

628
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,580
Ah, seriously! What's the point?

629
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,160
These can only be looked at,
but can't be eaten?

630
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,200
But you can have taste test.

631
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,780
Though this place is small,
there're still opportunities.

632
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,250
Go, feel free to eat whatever you want.

633
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,780
- Can I be at ease and eat boldly?
- Mmm.

634
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,360
But everybody is only eating one.

635
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,120
Do I have to be like that too?

636
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,930
If you have little nerve, then yes.

637
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,930
But you're not even a human, so you don't
need a good reputation.

638
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,670
Even if others are watching,
it won't hurt your self-respect.

639
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:56,920
Feel free to eat.

640
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,040
- But, you have to pretend you
don't know me. - Okay.

641
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,030
Cow, cow, cow.

642
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,670
Cow, cow!

643
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,290
Customer, taste this. It's really good.

644
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,660
She's really enjoying it.

645
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,700
<i>Oh, it's hot.</i>

646
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,300
While she's eating, I'll go upstairs
to the makeup counter,

647
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,690
put on some testers and spray on
some cologne.

648
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,010
<i>It seems like the human world is
very amusing, Miss Gumiho.</i>

649
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,060
<i>After being locked up for so long,
the world became more amazing, right?</i>

650
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,370
Who is it?

651
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,830
<i>Don't be afraid.
I won't catch you right away.</i>

652
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,290
<i>Try to find me.</i>

653
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,680
Where are you?

654
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,160
Let's see if you can find me in
the middle of all of these people.

655
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,220
<i>I'm quite curious too.</i>

656
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,750
Where are you?

657
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,330
Keep on talking.

658
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,110
- Is it you who's calling me?
- That's right.

659
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,340
It was me who called you.

660
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,590
You're not a human either.

661
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,180
Sure enough, you're not that child
I knew before.

662
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,770
If this movie is a success, it'll probably
bring in advertising offers too.

663
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,820
The makeup products are great.

664
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,050
Is it Dae Woong?

665
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,880
Oh, Noona!

666
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:43,270
He's my younger classmate.
I'll be back after I talk a bit with him.

667
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:44,700
Oh, okay.

668
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,180
- What are you doing here?
- Oh... Oh.

669
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,880
Since the auditions haven't started yet,
I'm just here to kill time.

670
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,150
Noona, you look beautiful.

671
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,850
Really? Does it look good?

672
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:02,060
Let's have a cup of tea and go together.

673
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,610
Where do we have to go to drink coffee?

674
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,510
How about let's go over there!

675
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,450
Where was it again?

676
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,010
You're saying that the Kil Dal whom
I resemble is a supernatural being?

677
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,270
Then, you’re a supernatural being too?

678
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,470
Well, almost the same thing.

679
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,400
So, you're actually not as powerful as me.

680
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:39,730
And I thought that you came to catch me.
You frightened me for a moment.

681
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,160
Actually, you're not as powerful as I am.

682
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,790
Because right now, you don't have
your bead.

683
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,280
You're already so weak that you can't
even distinguish my true form.

684
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,900
If I tried to catch you, you probably
couldn't put up much of a fight.

685
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,000
The bead isn't that far away from me.
It's nearby.

686
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,110
As we talk about this, doesn't it seem like
we should be in there instead of here?

687
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,270
I don't like going inside anywhere.

688
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,220
I've been locked up for too long.

689
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:23,560
It'll be best if you just returned.
This isn't the place for you to be.

690
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,840
No.

691
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,700
Why don't you find your bead first.

692
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,490
If he runs far away,
what are you going to do?

693
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,130
He promised me that he won't run away.

694
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:35,550
You believe in that human, Cha Dae Woong?

695
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,560
I've been in this place longer
than you have.

696
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,740
I'll give you some advice.

697
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,710
A human's promise...

698
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,990
Don't believe in it.

699
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,640
Ah, I have to go.

700
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,970
Next time, I'll find you again.

701
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,270
- Noona, here.
- Thanks.

702
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:12,748
Since you've been living in
Director Ban Doo Hong's action school,

703
00:53:12,749 --> 00:53:15,004
have you met him before?

704
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,180
Not yet. I asked Seon Nyeo to help,
and I'm just staying there temporarily.

705
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,910
Some issues arose between me and
my grandpa.

706
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,650
Really? Let's go.

707
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,830
- Noona, you go first.
- Why? Let's go together.

708
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,820
I still have some things I need to buy.
Noona, you go first.

709
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,130
What are you going to buy?
I'll wait for you.

710
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,020
You leave first. Practicing just a
couple lines would be really helpful.

711
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,460
You go first.
I hope your audition goes smoothly.

712
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,450
Why is Dae Woong always like that recently?

713
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,170
The plan to be together with Noona
has completely fallen flat.

714
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,280
I already promised her.
I can't do anything about it now.

715
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:14,130
But, where is she? What is she eating?

716
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,010
Yes, Manager Moon.
I’m heading there now.

717
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,270
<i>Come quickly, we still have
to change the outfits.</i>

718
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,690
Why?

719
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,690
I looked into the other person
that the director has his eye on.

720
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,730
So, even if you do dress like that,
you won't be able to get the lead role.

721
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:35,680
<i>Come quickly.</i>

722
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,040
Okay.

723
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,090
Ah, seriously, how annoying.

724
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,520
Whoa, it's cow.

725
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,450
Oh? Isn't she the girl from yesterday?

726
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,680
So it's because of her that he refused
to go together with me.

727
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,680
Are you looking for Dae Woong?

728
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:22,050
So you chasing after Dae Woong
is actually true.

729
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,330
Yes, I followed him here.

730
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,160
You're trying to mooch food again
by coming here with him, right?

731
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,370
Yes, but I didn't get any from him.

732
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,350
Oh, so you got this drink off him?

733
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,440
Dae Woong already left.

734
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,150
He was with me just now, and then he left.

735
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:47,110
It seems like he left without
even telling you.

736
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:49,210
No, Dae Woong is here.

737
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,280
He already left.

738
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,100
He can't be found, so why don't you
leave as well?

739
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,450
No, Dae Woong is looking for me right now.

740
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,470
Mi Ho.

741
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,780
Mi Ho.

742
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,230
Where did she run off to?

743
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,620
He stood you up.

744
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,600
So don't act proud and just leave.

745
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,720
No, he's coming to me right now.

746
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,090
- Then you're saying that I'm lying to you?
- Yes.

747
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,120
Dae Woong is right there!

748
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,610
What?

749
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,380
So you are indeed a liar.

750
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,550
Lying and mooching food off people,
Dae Woong doesn't like that.

751
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,640
I won't tell.

752
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,860
Hey!

753
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,190
What did you do?

754
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,300
What did you do?

755
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,630
What do I do?

756
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:57,100
Noona!

757
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,150
Noona! Are you okay?

758
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,560
It's all because of her.

759
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,930
What are you doing?

760
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:12,710
I was going to wear this outfit
to the audition. What to do?

761
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,670
- Then quickly change into another outfit.
- I can't.

762
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,470
This is matched with the role.

763
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,020
I picked it out especially for this.

764
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,330
<i>It has to be this outfit!</i>

765
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,300
Then I'll get you the same outfit
immediately.

766
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,320
Noona, you go over there first.

767
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,220
Exactly the same as this item
in white. Okay?

768
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,750
<i>The Gangnam branch still has one left.</i>

769
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,220
Thank you!

770
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,960
Dae Woong.

771
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,610
Auditions are starting now.
Please wait in order.

772
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,550
Aunt, thank you so much!

773
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,170
<i>Are you...</i>

774
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,970
<i>suspicious of me?</i>

775
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,890
Ok, enough.

776
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,210
<i>Here you go.</i>

777
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,420
Thank you!

778
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,050
<i>This is Miss Eun Hae In.</i>

779
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,950
Hello, my name is Eun Hae In.

780
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,140
Please wait a moment.
How is the audition coming along?

781
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:55,890
Eh?

782
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,050
Oh, Noona.

783
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,660
It's good that it ended successfully.

784
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,780
<i>But you weren't able to audition.
What are you going to do?</i>

785
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,050
It's okay.

786
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,860
There will be many other opportunities.

787
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,180
Noona, let's talk next time.

788
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,770
I'm hanging up.

789
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,380
We're going to eat at this restaurant.

790
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,060
Dae Woong, I don't like it here.
Let's go somewhere else.

791
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,980
I like this place.

792
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,310
I put up with a lot because of you.

793
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,660
So...

794
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,240
you put up with it this time.

795
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,850
I'm going to the bathroom.
Let go.

796
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,900
Hurry back.

797
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:21,990
Maybe it's because I'm on water that
I can't feel anything. I'm really scared.

798
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,370
Dae Woong is so sad, but I can't
talk to him.

799
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,960
Lots of delicious food to eat.

800
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:17,010
Why is it moving?

801
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,910
Dae Woong!

802
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,610
Dae Woong!

803
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,280
<i>Dae Woong!</i>

804
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,570
Dae Woong!

805
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,590
Dae Woong!

806
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,310
Woong!

807
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:49,980
Woong!

808
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,280
Regardless of how she is,
I don't care anymore.

809
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,310
Because of her, not one single thing
has gone smoothly!

810
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,370
There's still time before the ship pulls
into shore.

811
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,230
It'll be okay as long as she's not here,

812
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:51,490
doesn't matter if it's Jeju Island
or a foreign country.

813
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,210
He abandoned me.

814
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:22,420
He promised me.

815
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,360
It's raining.

816
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,090
<i>If it rains on a clear day, that means
I'm crying because I'm sad.</i>

817
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,840
Mi Ho...

818
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,950
She's crying...

<i>There isn't enough energy,
my face is starting to change.</i>

827
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:19,570
It's not the first time,
what's there to be afraid of?

828
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:24,680
<i>Wearing a large trench coat... you took your
pants off in front of a woman, didn't you?</i>

829
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,360
I'm definitely not that type of person.

830
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,410
<i>My body is back to normal. How long do I
have to keep the bead?</i>

831
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:34,120
<i>If I tell you that you've recovered, you'll
tell me to take back my bead and leave.</i>

832
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,290
<i>If there's a way for you to not go back,
are you willing die for it?</i>

833
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,900
After you drink my blood, if you can find
a human to accept your bead

834
