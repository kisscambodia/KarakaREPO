EPISODE 28

2
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:35,665
<i>Sir.</i>

3
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:37,464
Mrs. Lan is not feeling well.

4
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,824
Why don't I take you home first?

5
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:40,584
We'll take care of Xinya.

6
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:42,695
You must look after Xinya.

7
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,395
Don't worry.

8
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:45,865
Gu Nanxi.

9
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,024
I'll leave it to you.

10
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,105
Let's go.

11
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,465
Xinya.

12
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,025
Lanting.

13
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:01,105
Knife.

14
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:03,555
Do you have a knife? Do you?

15
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:06,304
Didn't you say that if I hurt myself,

16
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:08,735
I could keep Feng by my side?

17
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,784
I'm going to hurt myself.

18
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,744
-Xinya.
-I'll do whatever it takes.

19
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,744
Situ Feng is not going to come back.

20
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:17,465
Give me the knife. I beg you.

21
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:20,015
Let me keep him by my side.

22
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,744
Hua Munian, do you have a knife?

23
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:26,635
-Give me the sleeping pills.
-Xinya, knock it off.

24
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:28,585
Lanting.

25
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:32,185
Please help me.

26
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:36,064
-I beg you. Please help me.
-There's nothing you can do.

27
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,944
Even if you hit your head on the wall,

28
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:41,264
-Situ Feng wouldn't care.
-I beg you. Please help me.

29
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:42,145
Gu Nanxi.

30
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,144
Can you drag this crazy woman,
Yang Lanting, out?

31
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:47,424
Did you call me a crazy woman?

32
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,824
Did you not hear what I said?

33
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:50,665
Look.

34
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:54,904
You're a selfish, despicable
and reckless, crazy woman.

35
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,704
You don't understand anything.

36
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:57,944
I was only helping Xinya--

37
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,125
Helping Xinya?

38
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:01,335
Look at her right now.

39
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:03,184
Look at what you've done to her.

40
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,175
You weren't helping her.

41
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:06,984
This was Chen Qingqing's fault.

42
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,824
This has nothing to do with Chen Qingqing.

43
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:11,144
You're the one who should be responsible.

44
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,224
If you didn't plot any of those things,
Xinya wouldn't have become this way.

45
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:16,544
Her parents wouldn't have
to worry about her every day.

46
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:19,024
Situ Feng and Qingqing
wouldn't have had to endure that.

47
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,264
Today's farce wouldn't have happened.

48
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:23,245
All right. Stop fighting.

49
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:25,455
Let Xinya calm down first.

50
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:28,695
Lanting, come outside with me.

51
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,465
Feng.

52
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:39,345
Lanting.

53
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,904
Weren't you going too far this time?

54
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:46,425
You have to fight for what you truly want.

55
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:49,584
But that doesn’t mean
that you can put a person's life at risk.

56
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:52,224
You knew that Situ Feng
didn't like Lan Xinya.

57
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:54,155
How could you help her?

58
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,105
Gu Nanxi.

59
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,625
I'm very disappointed in all of you.

60
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,345
Lanting has left.

61
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,595
Nobody else will help me.

62
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:16,905
Xinya, if you want,

63
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,405
I can help you.

64
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:23,825
You?

65
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:27,505
Xinya.

66
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:31,464
From now on,
you have to let go of your past

67
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:33,275
and start a new life.

68
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,455
A new life?

69
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,424
You can't stop thinking
about Situ Feng right now.

70
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:44,175
But I'm telling you.

71
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:45,865
In a few days,

72
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:51,464
a few months or a few years,
you won't think about him anymore.

73
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:54,625
You will meet a better man.

74
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,975
Don't cry for a man who doesn't love you.

75
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,105
Without Feng,

76
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,915
what else can I do?

77
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:07,904
You'll definitely meet a man

78
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:11,384
who's better and more talented
than Situ Feng.

79
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:16,095
He will at least be ten times
or 100 times better than him.

80
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:20,465
Don't hurt yourself
for a man who doesn't love you.

81
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:25,085
It won't be easy to find such a man.

82
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,025
Besides,

83
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,664
I'm not worthy of love.

84
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,785
You are.

85
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,195
Do you want to bet?

86
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:42,424
You'll definitely find that man.

87
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,265
And...

88
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:45,145
I...

89
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,665
We can look for him together.

90
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,535
-Hurry, let's go.
-Let's go.

91
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,505
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

92
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:10,664
Where are we going?

93
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:11,944
To the airport.

94
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,224
I'm afraid that Lan Xinya
will create more drama.

95
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:16,664
I'm going to hide you at my house.

96
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,945
Qingqing, I'm sorry.

97
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,824
I don't think I can go with you.

98
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,265
-What?
-What?

99
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:26,205
What do you mean?

100
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:29,184
Are you going to leave me behind again?

101
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,965
-Seriously?
-Seriously?

102
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:33,745
Qingqing.

103
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:35,855
You're silly.

104
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:38,024
I didn't bring my ID.

105
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:40,215
I can't get on the plane.

106
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:42,264
That's right.

107
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:43,105
Qingqing.

108
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,745
I've promised you.

109
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,344
I will never let you go.

110
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:48,535
That's great.

111
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:58,985
So...

112
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,355
Where should we go now?

113
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,265
Nowhere.

114
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,024
Sometimes, when I run out of inspiration,

115
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:13,065
I will hop on a bus
and just wander aimlessly.

116
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:17,944
The view outside the window
will brighten up my mood.

117
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:20,605
Then, inspiration will come to me.

118
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,285
What are you doing?

119
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,784
I'm writing down what you said.

120
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:30,825
I'm making an illustration book

121
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:33,625
of Situ Feng's best quotes

122
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,504
to give back to my fans.

123
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,544
It's time for me to collect materials.

124
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,965
You're putting pressure on me.

125
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:43,195
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

126
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,784
You have the right to remain silent.

127
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:46,584
Anything you say can and will become

128
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:49,385
Hebiancao's source materials.

129
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,145
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

130
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:47,264
Shaofang, hurry up and ask Hebiancao
if she could get me a VIP ticket.

131
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,185
Hey!

132
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:52,064
Let's make Hebiancao's boyfriend
a resident singer at my place.

133
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,584
He'll sing every song that we request.

134
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:55,425
Hold on.

135
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:57,185
Calm down.

136
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:00,505
Have we all just become lovesick?

137
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:03,465
His Highness has a girlfriend.

138
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:08,375
I think that it's wise of him
to date someone like Hebiancao.

139
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:10,704
That's right. His Highness
has found the right girlfriend.

140
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:12,184
He has good taste in women.

141
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,304
I think that Hebiancao

142
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:17,265
will take His Highness's career
to the next level.

143
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:21,744
It's an honor to worship a star
with all of you.

144
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:22,984
Cheers to our bond.

145
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:26,024
-Cheers to our bond.
-Cheers to our bond.

146
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,025
Lin Yiyang.

147
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:28,864
Thank you for treating me to a movie.

148
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,675
Don't worry about it.

149
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:36,105
Fangfang.

150
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:37,945
I...

151
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,615
What is it?

152
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:42,375
It's nothing.

153
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:48,825
The movie was nice.

154
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:52,225
Did you like the female lead?

155
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,104
Yes, I liked her.

156
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,215
She's pretty. Why wouldn't I like her?

157
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,464
They went through so much in the movie.

158
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:03,144
They could finally be together.

159
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,765
What a nice ending.

160
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:13,585
Hey.

161
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:39,064
I didn't see anything.

162
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:40,565
You're a pervert.

163
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:44,585
Hey, I didn't see anything.

164
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:49,735
I didn't see anything.

165
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,895
I'm going back to the dorm.

166
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:55,305
So...

167
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:58,885
Are you going
to the library again tomorrow?

168
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,505
I really didn't see anything.

169
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:08,185
Stop talking about it.

170
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,145
Guys.

171
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:28,864
Are you both waiting
for the other person to talk first?

172
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:31,535
Are you trying to burn my tongue?

173
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,704
My little master, Situ Feng
and Madam Chen Qingqing.

174
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:38,504
Can you give me a heads-up
before you cause trouble next time?

175
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:40,184
The press was looking for me.

176
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:44,104
Do you know how much money I spent
to settle this matter?

177
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:45,725
By the way, Daniel.

178
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,575
You've maxed out all these cards.

179
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,184
Is there another way to pay?

180
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:51,304
They're all maxed out?

181
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,384
That's right. It's better to pay in cash.

182
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:54,955
I've got an idea.

183
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,664
I've borrowed 150,000 yuan from 9Fbank.

184
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,144
Withdraw the money.

185
00:11:59,145 --> 00:11:59,985
Okay.

186
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:07,745
Well...

187
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:10,144
I'm sorry, Daniel.

188
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,344
We'll give you a heads-up next time.

189
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,155
There's no next time.

190
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:18,664
Luckily, the fans reacted positively
to the news of you two dating.

191
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:21,544
It seems like if you find
the right person to date,

192
00:12:21,545 --> 00:12:23,595
the fans won't overreact.

193
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:27,304
Let me think of a way
to settle this matter.

194
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:29,784
By the way, Situ Feng,
have you checked the chart lately?

195
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:33,185
Your album has remained
among the top five.

196
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:36,384
The agency thinks very highly
of you and trusts you.

197
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:39,235
Talented boy, keep up the good work.

198
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:40,785
But...

199
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:41,985
Daniel.

200
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,944
-Yes?
-The things between Qingqing and I

201
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:47,665
may not be so simple.

202
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:49,705
We've caused

203
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:53,305
a small problem.

204
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:57,965
Stop. Let me take a sip of water
before you tell me.

205
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,985
Do you remember Qingchen?

206
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:01,875
Yes, I do.

207
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:10,225
Chen Qingqing? Qingchen?

208
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,835
Is she Qingchen?

209
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:13,825
It's you.

210
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,465
You're also Hebiancao.

211
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:18,184
You're quite an actress.

212
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:22,624
Do you want to join showbiz
and help grow the film industry?

213
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,905
I didn't have a choice.

214
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:27,224
Daniel, would it be a problem

215
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,544
if my fans found out

216
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:30,144
that Chen Qingqing is Qingchen?

217
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:32,144
But I shouldn't keep this from them.

218
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,184
I'll draft a news release regarding this.

219
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:36,384
And make the public
accept the fact step by step.

220
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:40,585
Can you stop giving me
a challenging problem each day?

221
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:41,585
I swear.

222
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,875
This is the last problem.

223
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:55,145
Hey!

224
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,305
Isn't this Zhang Fangfang?

225
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:02,065
<i>I heard that you're dating Lin Yiyang.</i>

226
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,024
Where is he?

227
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:06,984
Are you waiting for him?

228
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:09,264
He will be here soon.
Is there anything you need from him?

229
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,025
Nothing special.

230
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:14,344
But Zhang Fangfang,
if I remember correctly,

231
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:17,584
you came to our school
on scholarship, didn't you?

232
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:20,184
But you're hanging out with Lin Yiyang.

233
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:22,025
He's a bad influence.

234
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,625
I'm afraid

235
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:26,944
that you might end up getting
kicked out of school.

236
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:29,665
Xinyan, what are you talking about?

237
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:32,064
That will never happen to Fangfang.

238
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:33,384
And think about it.

239
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:35,024
If she becomes Lin Yiyang's girlfriend,

240
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:39,305
she will be able to live a wealthy life.

241
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,584
She won't have to go to school.

242
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:45,825
However, Lin Yiyang
is just dating you for fun.

243
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:47,305
I...

244
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,405
Let's go, Fangfang.

245
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:59,495
Lin Yiyang,
you haven't apologized to me yet.

246
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,264
I'm sorry, Hong Xiaoman.

247
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:02,584
Let me apologize to you for him.

248
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,145
Why are you apologizing for him?

249
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:07,584
Do you really think
that you're somebody to him?

250
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:08,545
I...

251
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,984
Of course she has the right
to apologize for me.

252
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:16,584
But you don't have the right
to accept her apology.

253
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:19,135
I heard what you said just now.

254
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,544
But you were wrong about something.

255
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,864
If Fangfang doesn't deserve
to attend this college,

256
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,424
I'm sure that the two of you
would get expelled sooner than her.

257
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,144
How dare you bully us?

258
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,504
Aren't you afraid
of getting kicked out of college?

259
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,725
Did anyone see you getting bullied by me?

260
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,824
But something came to my mind

261
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:36,944
after seeing you two.

262
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:39,344
I have a very special hobby lately.

263
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,515
Isn't that right, Fangfang?

264
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:42,985
Yes.

265
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:45,265
Lately,

266
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,855
I like to raise scorpions.

267
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:51,655
A scorpion loves to sting a girl's lips.

268
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,115
If you don't leave Fangfang alone,

269
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:56,305
I promise

270
00:15:57,185 --> 00:15:59,264
to give scorpions to you as a gift.

271
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,345
Xiaoman, let's go.

272
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,725
Let's go, Fangfang.

273
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,025
Fangfang.

274
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,264
Do you want to be the person

275
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,544
who gets to decide things
for me in the future?

276
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,185
What do you mean?

277
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:31,455
Why are you so dumb?

278
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:33,935
Be my girlfriend.

279
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:49,265
I made a lot of mistakes in the past.

280
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:58,184
But I really want to be
a part of your world.

281
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,304
I will try to become the person

282
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,425
that you expect me to be.

283
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:04,305
So...

284
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,735
will you be my girlfriend?

285
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:35,805
Sir, is there anything you need?

286
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,385
You.

287
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:41,304
Release Chen Qingqing's information

288
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:43,825
to the paparazzi.

289
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:47,835
Sir, but shouldn't we give
Mr. Chen a heads-up?

290
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,224
Don't worry about that old man.

291
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:52,744
Just listen to me.

292
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:53,625
Yes, sir.

293
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,584
Every girl tries to dress up,
but you dress down instead.

294
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:24,335
I don't know what to say to you.

295
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,504
I'm used to this look.

296
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,024
Which version of you do you prefer?

297
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,185
Well,

298
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:31,955
every girl wants

299
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,905
to look pretty.

300
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:35,105
Right?

301
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:37,185
Look at me.

302
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:42,335
Look at these pair of glasses,
these freckles and this hair.

303
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:44,664
Come to think of it.

304
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,665
I look

305
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:48,504
like a combination of SpongeBob and Arale.

306
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:49,584
Do you think so?

307
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:50,425
Look.

308
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:53,715
"Look, Patrick Star.

309
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:57,265
A cloud has appeared in the clear sky."

310
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,305
"That cloud is really a cloud."

311
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:08,825
Besides, I'm doing this

312
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:12,064
because I'm afraid that my grandpa
and Lu Jingyang will catch me.

313
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:16,065
Therefore, I have to act like Spider-Man.

314
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:18,985
This is my mask.

315
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:22,744
But you don't have to be afraid anymore.
You don't need the makeup now.

316
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,935
You're right.

317
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,104
Today's the first day of school.

318
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:29,184
Why don't you go to school looking pretty

319
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:31,725
and see how everyone will react?

320
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,225
Really?

321
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:36,155
But I'm used to this look.

322
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:40,584
If I become pretty all of a sudden,
I will be making a counterattack.

323
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,744
-You will become the campus beauty.
-Really?

324
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:45,225
The Goddess will become a joke.

325
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:50,105
<i>They've always been a joke in my eyes</i>

326
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,585
<i>The biggest joke ever</i>

327
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:58,645
Chen Qingqing?

328
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:15,465
She's so pretty.

329
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,185
Isn't she Qingchen?

330
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:19,815
I can't stop drooling over her.

331
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:23,465
She's so pretty.

332
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,104
There are two good-looking people

333
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:31,625
in the class.

334
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,464
You must feel really lucky.

335
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,655
That's right.

336
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:36,224
Zhang Fangfang is also very pretty.

337
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,624
We're really lucky.

338
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,584
That's right. We're aware

339
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,464
that we'll never get
to date girls like them.

340
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:44,624
Therefore, I'm happy
to just be able to look at them.

341
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,805
That’s true.

342
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:51,205
-Chen Qingqing is so beautiful.
-Chen Qingqing is so beautiful.

343
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:56,665
Please don't go away.

344
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,145
-So pretty.
-So pretty.

345
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,445
Situ Feng.

346
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,625
Do you notice anything different
about me today?

347
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:14,145
No, I don't.

348
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:15,664
You didn't wear your glasses.

349
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:21,675
Even if you walk on the streets like this,
no one will take a glance at you.

350
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:27,024
What are you looking at?

351
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:29,085
Don't you need to study?

352
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,024
You only care about your appearances.

353
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,384
You should be embarrassed of yourselves.

354
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:39,425
Have you solved the permutations
and combinations on the blackboard?

355
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:42,045
Turn around.

356
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,824
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

357
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:45,705
Teach me.

358
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:50,845
But Your Highness,
this is the Chemistry textbook.

359
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:55,385
Are permutations
and combinations not Chemistry?

360
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:57,145
Yes.

361
00:21:58,425 --> 00:21:59,705
You're close.

362
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:12,665
Nanxi.

363
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,465
Over there.

364
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:21,545
Right there.

365
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:30,544
Who's looking at you?

366
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:32,824
Why were you trying
to act cool all of a sudden?

367
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:34,024
The word is out.

368
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,955
My fans have come here.

369
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:36,945
Fans?

370
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:38,985
Where?

371
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:42,105
Ten o'clock.

372
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:50,184
Hello. So you've found out
where I go to school.

373
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:51,744
Situ Feng, are you a student here too?

374
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,424
That's right. Do you want my autograph
or do you want to take a photo with me?

375
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:57,144
We're looking
for the famous Chen Qingqing.

376
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:59,504
We heard that she goes to this school.
She's a wealthy girl,

377
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,144
but she chose to live like a commoner.

378
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,264
We're really inspired by her.

379
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:05,624
Can you give her
these flowers and letters?

380
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,144
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

381
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:08,695
-Okay.
-Thank you.

382
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:12,125
Thank you.

383
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:17,505
Actually, I can give you my autograph.

384
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,305
Well,

385
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:22,544
I went to your signing event once.
I've already got your autograph.

386
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,385
But thank you.

387
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:43,704
Can you tell us the progress
of your latest comic book?

388
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,385
Hey!

389
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,935
-Show me the characters.
-Move.

390
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:49,904
Hey, what are you doing?

391
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,184
She's pretty, but it doesn't mean
that you can harass her.

392
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:54,745
Also, stop giving her gifts.

393
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,904
Can you not be so shallow?

394
00:23:56,905 --> 00:24:00,264
We represent
the Ballet Academy of Yuncheng.

395
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:04,504
Miss Chen Qingqing's ballet technique
has reached the realm of the fairies.

396
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:07,144
We really hope to witness
your performance.

397
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,225
Thank you.

398
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,184
We're from the Comics Club.

399
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:14,704
Goddess Chen Qingqing's drawings remind me
of several pioneer cartoonists from Japan.

400
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,435
I hope to directly learn from her.

401
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:18,904
We're from the Piano Association.

402
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:22,104
Miss Chen Qingqing's music
has cleansed our souls.

403
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:25,705
Just the thought of it
makes me want to cry.

404
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,505
You're exaggerating.

405
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:31,504
It's true.

406
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:33,704
After seeing the video
of Goddess Chen Qingqing,

407
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,624
we were all shocked.

408
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,624
And it's unbelievable
that she's also so pretty.

409
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,065
I'm no match for her.

410
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:45,985
After hearing your confession,

411
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,664
I'm pretty shocked too.

412
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:55,475
Mister, please don't block our way.
We're trying to learn from our goddess.

413
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:01,265
Thank you.

414
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:04,705
Excuse me.

415
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:07,625
Goddess.

416
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:08,665
Thank you.

417
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:14,455
-Miss Chen Qingqing, I worship you.
-Goddess Qingqing, you're amazing.

418
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:23,344
Hello, Daniel.
Qingqing's gone back to being pretty.

419
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:24,544
Aren't you going to step in?

420
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:26,304
Gosh. You've never asked me

421
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,224
to step into anything
since you made your debut.

422
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:29,105
I...

423
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:31,265
I'm doing this for her.

424
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:32,224
Think about it.

425
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:35,664
Once her looks are exposed,
she will get caught up in scandals.

426
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:38,064
<i>People might bash her
for hiding her identity</i>

427
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:41,024
in order to get close to me. Am I right?

428
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:42,104
It won't be fair to her.

429
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:46,145
Gosh, Situ Feng.

430
00:25:46,305 --> 00:25:47,544
Give me some advice.

431
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,864
You don't understand the public at all.

432
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:51,915
The frog became a prince.

433
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:53,384
The beast also became a prince.

434
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,145
The prince and princess
lived happily ever after.

435
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:01,464
Did the public get upset by the stories?
They didn't.

436
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:04,184
<i>The public will be thrilled
to see an ugly girl become pretty.</i>

437
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:06,344
<i>There won't be any negative coverage.</i>

438
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:08,464
<i>I think the public
will like Chen Qingqing.</i>

439
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:09,704
You know what?

440
00:26:09,705 --> 00:26:11,144
She should become a celebrity too.

441
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:12,784
I think this is a great idea.

442
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:13,744
What do you think?

443
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:14,585
Hello?

444
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:16,865
Situ Feng?

445
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:17,945
<i>Hey!</i>

446
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:19,705
<i>Feng.</i>

447
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:20,945
<i>Hello?</i>

448
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:29,904
<i>I've done too many stupid things.</i>

449
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:31,704
For someone who doesn't even love me,

450
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:34,425
I've forgotten what really matters.

451
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:36,184
<i>Why are you here?</i>

452
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:38,744
You don't have to work
in this cafe anymore.

453
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:40,424
What the hell do you think you're doing?

454
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:43,944
<i>We're dating. We're not starring
in the drama The President's Lovely Wife.</i>

455
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:46,544
I have done what you ordered,
Young Master.

456
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:47,464
This is smart of you.

457
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:50,064
This couple would not be able
to handle all the negative comments.

458
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:51,065
Come here.

459
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:53,704
Tell me. Why did you look at me like that?

460
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,024
I'm trying to drive a wedge between them.

461
00:26:56,025 --> 00:26:57,585
<i>Just wait and see.</i>

462
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:03,075
