352
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:09,574
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

353
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:11,708
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

354
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:13,945
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

355
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:17,717
You can kiss your license goodbye.

356
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,418
I heard the chief's daughter was here.
- CHARLIE: Dr. Cullen.

357
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:21,858
Charlie.

358
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:24,321
I've got this one, Jackie.

359
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,728
Isabella.

360
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:28,522
Bella.

361
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:31,870
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?

362
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:33,098
Good.

363
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:35,238
Look here.

364
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:40,269
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress or disorientation,

365
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:42,246
but your vitals look good.

366
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:44,407
No signs of any head trauma.

367
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:46,007
I think you'll be just fine.

368
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,552
TYLER: I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really...

369
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:52,915
You know,
it would've been a whole lot worse

370
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:55,858
if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.

371
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:58,020
Edward? Your boy?

372
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,995
Yeah, it was amazing.

373
00:23:00,065 --> 00:23:02,829
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.

374
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,994
Sounds like you were very lucky.

375
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,367
Charlie.

376
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,605
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...

377
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:16,746
You should probably call your mom.

378
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,442
Did you tell her?

379
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:23,186
(GROANS) She's probably just

380
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:25,983
freaking out.

381
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:28,623
ROSALIE: fifteen kids that saw
what happened.

382
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:31,253
EDWARD: What was I supposed to do, then?
Let her die?

383
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,024
This isn't just about you. It's about all of us.

384
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:36,896
CARLISLE: I think we should
take this in my office.

385
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:41,905
Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Rosalie.

386
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:49,377
What?

387
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,116
How did you get over to me so fast?

388
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:57,654
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

389
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:01,522
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

390
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:03,718
No, I wasn't.

391
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:05,688
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

392
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:07,892
Yes, you were.

393
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:12,799
Bella, you're... You hit your head.

394
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,632
I think you're confused.

395
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,137
I know what I saw.

396
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,333
And what exactly was that?

397
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,540
You...

398
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:24,212
You stopped the van.

399
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:27,477
You pushed it away with your hand.

400
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:31,148
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

401
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:34,617
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

402
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:37,725
I just need to know the truth.

403
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:41,560
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

404
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,489
Thank you.

405
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,664
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.

406
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,706
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

407
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,376

I need everybody's permission slips, okay?

411
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,677
Sammy, please collect them.
- Yeah.

Guys, let's go.

413
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,486
Come on, get in. In. Let's go!

414
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,329
Look at you, huh? You're alive.

415
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,962
I know, yeah. False alarm, I guess.
- Yeah.

416
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:01,806
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

417
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,571
it's like a month away, but...

(MIKE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

419
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:08,709
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

420
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,846
So, what do you think?

421
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:16,856
About what?
- Do you want to go?

422
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,292
To prom?

423
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,021
With me?

I...

426
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:26,795
Prom.

427
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:29,033
Dancing.

428
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:31,798
Not such a good idea for me.

429
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,872
I have something that weekend anyway.

430
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,876
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

431
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,912
You can't go another weekend?

432
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,880
Non-refundable ticket.

433
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:44,741
You should ask Jessica.

434
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:46,786
I know she wants to go with you.

435
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,616
All right. All right.

We gotta go. We gotta go.
Green is what? Good.

Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.

442
00:27:05,537 --> 00:27:07,027
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.

443
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:12,476
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup
of compost tea.

444
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:13,903
Okay.
- Give me that.

445
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:17,881
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

446
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,578
Don't drink it! It's for the plants.

447

What's in Jacksonville?

448
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,452
How did you know about that?

449
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,790
You didn't answer my question.

450
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,794
You don't answer any of mine, so...

451
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:36,494
I mean, you don't even say hi to me.

452
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,130
Hi.

453
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:42,399
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

454
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:45,374
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush.

455
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:48,504
It's very common. You can Google it.

456
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,145
Floridians.

457
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,516
That's what's in Jacksonville.

458
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:59,852
Can you at least watch where you walk?

459
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,626
Look, I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.
I just think it's the best way.

00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:09,462
Bella! Guess who just asked me to prom.

461
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,230
Who?

462
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:16,763
Yeah, I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.

463
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:20,004
It's not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No. Zero weirdness.

Bella, we shouldn't be friends.

470
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:41,423
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

471
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:43,557
I mean, why didn't you just
let the van crush me

472
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,101
and save yourself all this regret?

473
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:50,036
What, you think I regret saving you?

00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:53,565
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

Well, that's your fault.

You shouldn't have told her
about the "almost" accident. You finished?

Yeah.

483
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:25,931
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
She always did know how to worry.

and it was a foam board.

are kind of giving me whiplash.

not that I didn't wanna be.

What does that mean?

511
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:47,485
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

512
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:51,652
Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake
that I'm not smart.

513

Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.

You're not.

I can see what you're trying to put off,

521
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:20,749
but I can see that it's just
to keep people away from you.

522
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,378
It's a mask.

523
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:30,089

01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:25,947
The prom is an important rite of passage.
I didn't want you to miss anything.

Do you want to go?
- Yeah.

DJ: All right, slowing it down.

1585
01:50:09,133 --> 01:50:10,657
Shall we?

1586
01:50:11,802 --> 01:50:13,394
You're serious?

If you just let the venom spread,

1600
01:51:02,752 --> 01:51:04,947
I could be like you by now.

1601
01:51:06,756 --> 01:51:09,281
You don't know what you're saying.

1602

You don't want this.
- I want you.

Every second, I get closer.

1608
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,870
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1609

Alice said that she saw me like you.

1610

- Her visions change.

1611
01:51:39,754 --> 01:51:42,245
Yeah, based on what people decide.

1612
01:51:42,991 --> 01:51:44,583
I've decided.

1613
01:51:47,963 --> 01:51:50,454
So that's what you dream about.

1614
01:51:50,532 --> 01:51:52,329
Becoming a monster.

1615
