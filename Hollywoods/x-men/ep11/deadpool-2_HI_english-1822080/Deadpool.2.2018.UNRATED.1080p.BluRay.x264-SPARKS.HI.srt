is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

569

01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,536
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

1236
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,364
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

1237
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,290

1238

1240

1244

catfished here or...?

1245

tell us about?

1246
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,223
PETER; No.

1247
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,430
I don't have one.

1248
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,807

1249

1250

Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

1251
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,605

1252
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,810
That's all the diabetes.

1253
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,145
- Right?
- Yeah, you got 'em all.

1254
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,151
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

1255
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,649
Yeah.

1256
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:19,824
You're in.

1257
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,401
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

1258
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,201
It's fulfilling work.

1259
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,582

1260
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,765

departing the Ice Box.

1263
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,571
I was born into war.

1264

1265
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,406
Okay-

1266
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,583
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

1267
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:13,753
These restraints are pretty...

1268
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,251
People think
they understand pain.

1269
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,169
They have no concept of it

1270
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,217
beyond their own
worst experience.

1271
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,968

1272
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,548

1275
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,684

1276

Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

1277
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,103
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

1278
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,779
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

1279
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,072
I've got a list.

1280
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,783
We're gonna work down it.

1281
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,485
Together.

1282
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,780
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

1283
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,038
Something that was not
meant to bend.

1284
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,163
I'm gonna stop you right there

1285
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,540
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

1286
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,917
I won't even make it to one.

1287
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,668
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

1288
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,875
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

1289
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,169
I cried when they
canceled Felicity.

1290
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,383
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

1291
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,805
I have one right now.

1292
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,428
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

1293
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,553
I don't want you to hurt me,

1294
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,886
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

1295
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,472
Except for where they are.

1296
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,273
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

1297
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,566
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1298
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,064
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

1300
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,363

1301

I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.

1304
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,533
Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.

1305
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,285
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

1306

Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1307
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:37,163
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

1308
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,002

we all go home early.

them, Cable, I warn you...

in effect.

1326

your opinion, Peter!
