Ugh, I don't know.

181

She'll be okay.

182
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,512
We'll be okay.

183
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,266

184
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,980
she's tough. (CHUCKLES)

185
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,564
Yeah, she is.

186
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,485
Hey.

187
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,279

is in there, but that is not my son!

You went back to my house?

195
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,802
To look for Barb.

196
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,971
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

197
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,681
That's crazy.

198
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

199
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,311
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

200
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,063
just hanging out in my yard?

201
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,898
I don't think it was a mask.

202
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,775
But he had no face?

203
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,778
I don't know!

204
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,739
I don't know, I just...

205
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,408
I have a terrible feeling about this.

210
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,083
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

My dad's a grade-A asshole.

Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

216
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,934
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

217
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,936
don't mention the beers.

218
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,813
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

219
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,024
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

220

(SCOFFS) I can't believe you right now.

- No, I...

00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:34,541
(STAMMERS) I need to think.
Just go on home.

226

- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.

No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

232
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,978
- Shut down? What...
- We have to deal with this, Mom.

234

The funeral?

(LOUDLY) For that thing back there?

Okay, let me get this straight.

Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

238

And there's a monster in the wall?

239
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,202
Do you even hear yourself?

240
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,205
I know it sounds crazy.

241
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,623
(STAMMERS) I sound crazy!

242
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,500
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

243
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,751
It is crazy!

244
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,670

247
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:28,303
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

248

I don't care if anyone believes me!

249
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:35,018
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

250
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,188
(SHOUTING) I am going to bring him home!

a funeral for Will!

00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,780

another day!

into a baby monitor.

He spoke last night.

Maybe he's haunting us.

702
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:17,805
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

703
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:19,932
Talk to them.

704
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,975
I know.
It's weird.

705
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,060
No!

706
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,270
(STAMMERS) No, it is.

707
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:26,855
It's just, sometimes...

708
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,567
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

709
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,403
But you capture the right moment...

710
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:35,656
it says more.

711
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,116
What was I saying?

712
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,743
What?

713
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,120
When you took my picture.

714
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,456
I shouldn't have taken that.

715
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:47,668
I'm, uh...

716
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:49,294
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:52,673
It's just...

718
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,299
That's it.

719
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,344
That's what I saw.

721
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:01,807
My mom...

722
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,851
I thought she was crazy

723
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,686
'cause she said...

724
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:08,522
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

725
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,275
- And if he's alive...
- Then Barbara.

726
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,337
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

727
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:34,923
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.

728
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,717
(LAUGHING) I'll just be a minute.

729
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:44,892
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

730
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,018
Hey, you can't be back here.

731
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,821
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

732
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:49,730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

733
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,899
- It's some emergency...
- What the hell are you talking about?

734
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:53,108
I don't work with O'Bannon.

735
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,985
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

736
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,989
