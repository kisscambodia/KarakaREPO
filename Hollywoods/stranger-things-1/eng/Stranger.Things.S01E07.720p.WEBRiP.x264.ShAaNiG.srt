1
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:11,366
[Mike sighs] That's better.

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,625
You don't need it.

3
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:24,903
Still pretty?

4
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:26,780
Yeah!

5
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,758
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:36,098
El?

7
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,392
Yes?

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,647
[stammers] Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:45,232
Me, too.

10
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:53,348
- [door opens]
- Guys!

11
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:55,250
[panting] It's Lucas, I
think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,937
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:00,605
- [Mike] Yeah.
- What if he found it?

14
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:02,708
[Lucas shouting indistinctly on radio]

15
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,734
What's he saying?

16
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:06,879
I don't know, he's way out of range.

17
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:08,905
[Lucas] ...son of a bitch!

18
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:12,117
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow
down. We can't understand you.

19
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:14,786
Yes, I copy! Do you?

20
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:16,621
They know about Eleven!

21
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,748
Get out of there! They
know about Eleven!

22
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:21,334
The bad men are coming! All of them!

23
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:24,087
Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!

24
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,839
"Mad hen." Does that
mean anything to you?

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,257
Like a code name or something?

26
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:29,801
- [Lucas] The bad men are coming!
- "Bad men."

27
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:31,511
- Bad men!
- [radio static]

28
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,531
[gasps] Stay here.

29
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:44,107
[Mike] What's that guy doing?

30
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:46,127
You don't think...

31
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:50,504
Well, I know she and Steve have
been spending some time together,

32
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:51,756
- so I thought maybe...
- Mom!

33
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,491
[stammers] Well, is he home?

34
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:54,618
- Maybe you could ask him?
- Mom!

35
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:55,994
I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please?

36
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:58,338
Michael, I'm on the phone. I've
told you a million times...

37
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:00,206
- Did you schedule any repairs?
- What?

38
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,977
Is there anyone supposed to
come and do repairs on the house?

39
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:14,679
I don't understand. Is
there something wrong...

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,015
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- [Dustin] Mike!

41
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:19,059
- One second.
- [yells] Mike!

42
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,080
We need to leave... [panting] right now.

43
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:27,126
- [sighs]
- Michael!

44
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:30,987
If anyone asks where I
am, I've left the country.

45
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:32,173
What?

46
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,136
[Dustin grunts]

47
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:59,909
[Dustin] Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

48
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:06,582
- [engines starting]
- [tires screeching]

49
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,736
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

50
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:14,280
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- [Lucas on radio] Dustin!

51
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,157
Dustin, do you copy?

52
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,076
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

53
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:19,786
- Where are you?
- Cornwallis.

54
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:21,162
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!

55
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,872
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

56
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:24,183
Okay.

57
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,609
- Shit!
- This way, come on!

58
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:37,952
- [indistinct singing]
- [bicycle bell ringing]

59
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:39,973
Out of the way!

60
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,700
- Out of the way!
- [ringing continues]

61
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,480
- [Mike] Lucas!
- Where are they?

62
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,464
- [stammers] I don't know.
- I think we lost them.

63
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,320
- [tires screeching]
- Go, go, go, go, go!

64
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,840
[Dustin yelling]

65
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,491
[Mike] Go, go, go, go, go!

66
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:00,928
- Faster, faster!
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

67
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:06,267
[yelling]

68
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:18,154
- [van crashing]
- [tires screeching]

69
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,505
Holy... holy shit!

70
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,965
Did... did you see what
she did to that van?

71
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,133
No, Dustin, we missed it.

72
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:59,719
- [stammering] I mean that was...
- [Lucas] Awesome.

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,721
[Lucas panting]

74
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:03,490
It was awesome.

75
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:14,210
Everything I said about you
being a traitor and stuff...

76
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,921
I was wrong.

77
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:21,759
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:27,473
Friends...

79
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,267
friends don't lie.

80
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm sorry, too.

81
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,024
[Mike] Me, too.

82
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:52,289

85
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:08,514
Hey.

86
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:11,059
Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?

87
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,363
- [Callahan] Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

88
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,853
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

89
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:16,064
Well, your boy assaulted a
police officer. That's why.

90
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:18,441
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.

91
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,610
- Take them off!
- You heard her. Take 'em off.

92
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:26,175
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

93
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,165
What is this?

94
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,833
Why don't you ask your
son? We found it in his car.

95
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,543
- What?
- Why are you going through my car?

96
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,887
Is that really the question you
should be asking right now?

97
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,589
I wanna see you in my office.

98
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,025
You won't believe me.

99
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:47,112
[softly] Why don't you give me a try?

100
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:50,908
Mike? Mike?

101
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:55,788

[doorbell rings]

103
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:14,223
Yeah, just a minute, please!

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,976
- [under breath] Jiminy Christmas.
- [doorbell continues ringing]

105
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,354
Hold your horses.

106
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:25,383
Mr. Wheeler?

107
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:27,111
Yes?

108
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,244
[men speaking indistinctly]

109
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:10,928
[Karen stuttering] I don't understand.

110
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:13,389
You think my son is hiding this girl?

111
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,599
What happened to her hair?

112
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,226
We just need to know if you've
seen her in the past week.

113
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:20,521
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.

114
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:22,315
Our son with a girl?

115
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,692
[chuckles] I mean, believe me,

116
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:28,112
if he had a girl sleeping in
this house, we'd know about it.

117
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:29,781
Wouldn't we?

118
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:30,865
[Karen sighs]

119
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,700
This girl...

120
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,826
what has she done?

121
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:35,661
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

122
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,325
- Oh, my God, is she Russian?
- [stammers]

123
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,249
- You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.

124
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,043
You come into my house,

125
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:44,629
and you tell me that my
son is hiding some girl,

126
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,840
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

127
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:50,777
And you, what, you
expect me to remain, what, calm?

128
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,704
[sighs]

129
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,458
I understand how upsetting this is.

130
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,753
I wish we could tell you more...

131
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:14,134
but I can tell you that your
son, Michael, is in real danger.

132
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:18,037
We want to help him.

133
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,933
We will help him. I give you my word.

134
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:24,895
But in order for me to do that...

135
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:28,315
you have to trust me.

136
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,444
Will you trust me?

137
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:39,392
Good.

138
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:40,661
Now...

139
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,040
do you have any idea where
your son might have gone?

140
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:52,363
[Lucas] This is Randolph
Road, right here.

141
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:56,009
The fence starts here, and
goes all the way around.

142
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,036
And this is the lab right here.

143
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:00,620
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

144
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:01,706
It's gotta be.

145
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,666
[Dustin] Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

146
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,168
The sign says "Department of Energy."

147
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,378
Department of Energy? What
do you think that means?

148
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,422
It means government. Military.

149
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:11,674
- [Dustin] Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

150
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,258
It's military. My dad's told me before.

151
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,052
Mike's right. There's
soldiers out front.

152
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,180
Do they make, like, lightbulbs
or something?

153
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:18,472
[Mike] No, weapons...

154
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:20,256
to fight the
Russians, and commies and stuff.

155
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:21,900
[Lucas] Weapons.

156
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,146
[gasps] Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

157
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:28,024
Really bad. The place
is like a fortress.

158
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,150
Well, what do we do?

159
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,902
[Mike] I don't know,
but we can't go home.

160
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,403
We're fugitives now.

161
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,780
[helicopter approaching]

162
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,133
[stutters] Guys?

163
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,968
Do you hear that?

164
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,417
- [Mike] Go, go, go, go!
- [Dustin] Come on, come on!

165
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:48,169
- It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

166
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,503
- [Mike] Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
- [Lucas] Come on!

167
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:51,005
[Dustin] Go, go, go, go, go, go!

168
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,548
[helicopter whirring]

169
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,901
- [panting]
- [Lucas] Get down!

170
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:01,182
[helicopter receding]

171
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:02,659
Mental.

172
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,581
[Joyce sighs]

173
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,567
You say blood draws this thing?

174
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:13,003
We don't know.

175
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,255
It's just a theory.

176
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:20,534
[Jonathan] I'm sorry, Mom.

177
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:23,621
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

178
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,498
- That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.

179
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,082
That's not even close. That's
not even in the... in the ballpark.

180
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,669
I wanted to tell you, I just...

181
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,004
What if this thing took you, too?

182
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:35,383
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

183
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:38,928
[stammers] I thought I
could save Will... I still do.

184
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,389
This is not yours to fix alone.

185
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,310
[stammers] You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

186
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:47,520
You're not alone.

187
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:48,980
I know.

188
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,481
[sighs] God damn it, Jonathan.

189
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:53,293
- I know.
- Damn it.

190
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:55,254
[sniffling]

191
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:57,363
[Troy's mom] I want an apology!

192
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:58,614
[Callahan] An apology for what, exactly?

193
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,449
[Troy's mom] Where is the
chief? I want to speak to him

194
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,867
- right this instant.
- Stay here.

195
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,786
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

196
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:05,037
What is your name, Deputy?

197
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:06,914
Well, I'm an officer... [chuckles] okay?

198
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,457
[Troy's mom] Name and
badge number, both of you!

199
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,561
- What the hell is going on here?
- [Powell] Chief...

200
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:12,461
These men are humiliating my son.

201
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:14,547
- No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.

202
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:16,091
There was some kind of fight, Chief...

203
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:18,759
A psychotic child broke his arm!

204
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,096
- A little girl, Chief. A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone?

205
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:23,431
Honestly, I'm just
trying to state a fact.

206
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,932
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl...

207
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,601
Will you please take a
statement... [mouthing] and get her out?

208
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,585
- [Callahan] Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like?

209
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:32,106
She had no hair and she
was bleeding from her nose.

210
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:34,108
Like a freak.

211
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,335
What'd you just say?

212
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,528
I said she's a freak!

213
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:40,406
No, her hair. What'd
you say about her hair?

214
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:42,408
Her head's shaved.

215
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,261
She doesn't even look like a girl.

216
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,680
And...

217
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,515
And what?

218
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,601
Tell the man, Troy.

219
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,272
She can...

220
00:13:57,549 --> 00:13:58,799
do things.

221
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,177
What kind of things?

222
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:02,320
Like...

223
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:05,740
make you fly.

224
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,019
And piss yourself.

225
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,121
What?

226
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:13,707
Was she alone?

227
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,984
She always hangs out with those losers.

228
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,253
"Losers"?

229
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:20,881
What losers?

230
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,052
Hey.

231
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,681
You owe me $1.20.

232
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:33,037
Don't worry, he'll need more than
aspirin when we're done with him.

233
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,544
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

234
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:37,213
The cops should just
lock him up forever.

235
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,882
- Did you see the look on his face?
- [Steve groans]

236
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,801
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

237
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:44,545
He probably had that same look whenever
he killed his brother, right?

238
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:48,808
Oh, God, I just got an
image of him making that face

239
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,226
- while he and Nancy are screwing.
- [chuckles]

240
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:52,250
Carol, for once in your
life, shut your damn mouth!

241
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,062
- What?
- Hey, what's your problem, man?

242
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,359
You're both assholes. That's my problem.

243
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,777
- Are you serious right now, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

244
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:00,961
You shouldn't have done that.

245
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:02,238
- Done what?
- You know what.

246
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,198
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

247
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,534
Oh, that's funny, because I
don't remember you asking me to stop.

248
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,285
I should've put that spray
paint right down your throat.

249
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,995
- What the hell, Steve?
- [Steve] You know,

250
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,164
neither of you ever cared about
her. You never even liked her,

251
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:13,916
because she's not
miserable like you two.

252
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,460
She actually cares about other people.

253
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:16,752
The slut with a heart of gold.

254
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,045
I told you to watch your mouth!

255
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:20,423
Hey! I don't know what's
gotten into you, man,

256
00:15:20,424 --> 00:15:22,800
- but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.

257
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,385
- Or what?
- [grunts]

258
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,553
Or what?

259
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:27,221
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

260
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,389
You gonna fight me now, too?

261
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,784
Because you couldn't
take Jonathan Byers...

262
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:34,621
so I wouldn't recommend that.

263
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:41,694
[car door opens]

264
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:43,779
Here, let me get
the door for you, buddy.

265
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,657
That's right. Run away, Stevie boy!

266
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:49,243
Run away! Just like you always do.

267
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:52,681
That Nancy's turning
you into a little pussy!

268
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:56,041
- [tires screeching]
- That's right, Harrington, run away!

269
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,770
Run away! [scoffs]

270
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,930
[Nancy] I have to go home.

271
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,533
No, you can't.

272
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:15,370
- My mom... my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.

273
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,898
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.

274
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,642
- Let go!
- Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

275
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:22,151
The last thing in the world we need

276
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:23,944
is them knowing you're
mixed up in all this.

277
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:26,572
- Mike is over there...
- They haven't found him.

278
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:27,948
Not yet, at least.

279
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:29,717
[helicopter whirring]

280
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,304
- For Mike?
- Come on, get in the car.

281
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:37,750
Look, we need to find
them before they do.

282
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,574
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone?

283
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:42,046
- No, I don't.
- I need you to think.

284
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:43,839
I don't know. We haven't talked a lot.

285
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,758
I mean, lately... [sighs]

286
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,009
Is there any place that your...

287
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,053
your parents don't
know about that he might go?

288
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:51,263
- [stuttering] I don't know.
- I might.

289
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:52,431
What?

290
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:56,536
I don't know where he is, but
I think I know how to ask him.

291
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,005
Whoa.

292
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,097
I got it.

293
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,004
[helicopter hovering]

294
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:27,633
[Nancy on radio]
Mike, are you there? Mike?

295
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,051
You guys hear that?

296
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:31,279
Mike, it's me, Nancy.

297
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:35,015
Mike, are you there?

298
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,767
Answer.

299
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,519
Mike, we need you to answer.

300
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,163
Is that your sister?

301
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,774
This is an emergency, Mike.

302
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,168
Do you copy?

303
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,820
Mike, do you copy?

304
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:49,446
Okay, this is really weird.

305
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,031
Don't answer.

306
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:53,200
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick?

307
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:56,036
- It's your sister!
- What if the bad people kidnapped her?

308
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:57,822
What if they're forcing her to say this?

309
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:58,998
I need you to answer.

310
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,625
It's like Lando
Calrissian. Don't answer.

311
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:03,478
We need to know that you're there, Mike.

312
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:07,006
Listen, kid, this is the
chief. If you're there, pick up.

313
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:09,091
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

314
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:11,218
Why is she with the chief?

315
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,595
How the hell does he know about...

316
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:16,599
[Hopper] We can protect you, we
can help you, but you gotta pick up.

317
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,327
Are you there? Do you copy? Over.

318
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:23,331
[sighs]

319
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,253
Anybody got any other ideas?

320
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:31,339
[Mike] Yeah, I copy.

321
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,366
It's Mike.

322
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,802
I'm here.

323
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,431
We're here.

324
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:50,567
[Steve] Need a hand?

325
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:53,820
Did you have something to do with this?

326
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:55,989
I just...

327
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,158
I wanna help.

328
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:07,876
All yours.

329
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:24,458
[sighs] They expect us to
just sit here like prisoners.

330
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,168
We should be out there looking for him.

331
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:29,046
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

332
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:31,924
This is our
government. They're on our side.

333
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,026
[Karen sighs]

334
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:35,946
That man gives me the creeps.

335
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,640
Nancy.

336
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:42,184
You don't think she's involved
in this, too, do you?

337
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,686
Nancy with Mike?

338
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:45,246
[chuckles] No.

339
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:48,333
- No.
- [sighs]

340
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:53,546
[Dustin breathing heavily]

341
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,161
Will you stop pacing?

342
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:03,205
It's been way too long.

343
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:06,208
Do you know what? Maybe you're
right. Maybe this is all a trap

344
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,072
and the bad men are
coming to get us right now!

345
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,086
It's not a trap.

346
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,171
Why would the chief set us up?

347
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:13,424
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

348
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:14,883
Lando Calrissian.

349
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,635
Would you shut up about Lando?

350
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:18,979
I don't feel good about
this. I don't feel good about this!

351
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,960
[shouting] When do you
feel good about anything?

352
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,701
[vehicles approaching]

353
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:33,610
[Dustin] Shit!

354
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,046
[Mike] Go, go, go, go.

355
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:38,991
[panting] Lando.

356
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:40,826
You think they saw us?

357
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,595
Both of you, shut up.

358
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,623
[grunts]

359
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:28,887
- [man 1] Hey!
- [blows landing]

360
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,209
[man 1 grunts]

361
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,645
[man 2] What the... [grunting]

362
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:34,939
[door creaks]

363
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:39,319
[breathing heavily] All right, let's go.

364
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,655
Let's go!

365
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:08,181
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

366
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:14,044
I was so worried about you.

367
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:16,564
Yeah, uh... me, too.

368
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:23,279
Is that my dress?

369
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,935
Okay, so, in this
example, we're the acrobat.

370
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:32,938
Will and Barbara, and that
monster, they're this flea.

371
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,399
And this is the Upside
Down, where Will is hiding.

372
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,944
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

373
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:40,648
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

374
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:42,042
With our compasses.

375
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:47,202
Okay, so the gate has a really
strong electromagnetic field,

376
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:49,496
and that can change the
directions of a compass needle.

377
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:50,789
Is this gate underground?

378
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,558
[Eleven] Yes.

379
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,645
Near a large water tank?

380
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:57,522
Yes.

381
00:22:58,298 --> 00:22:59,857
[stutters] How do you know all that?

382
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:03,010
He's seen it.

383
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:04,946
[Joyce] Is there any
way that you could...

384
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:08,682
that you could reach Will? That
you could talk to him in this...

385
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:09,850
The Upside Down.

386
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:11,577
[whispering] Down. Yeah.

387
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,354
[Nancy] And my friend Barbara?

388
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:15,915
Can you find her, too?

389
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:21,838
[static]

390
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:30,179
[static increases]

391
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,112
[static becomes faint]

392
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:53,226
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:54,353
What?

394
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,581
[stuttering] What's
wrong? What happened?

395
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:59,333
[voice breaks] I can't find them.

396
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:25,193
[turns faucet off]

397
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,102
[Mike] Whenever she uses
her powers, she gets weak.

398
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:37,729
The more energy she
uses, the more tired she gets.

399
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,399
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.

400
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,776
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.

401
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:45,737
Well... [stutters] How
do we make her better?

402
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:48,657
We don't. We just have
to wait and try again.

403
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:50,575
[Nancy] Well, how long?

404
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:52,035
I don't know.

405
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:53,370
[Eleven] The bath.

406
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:54,722
[Joyce] What?

407
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,018
I can find them.

408
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,562
In the bath.

409
00:25:04,424 --> 00:25:05,858
[screaming]

410
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:07,944
[woman] Oh!

411
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:12,347
Oh. Oh, my... No, mmm-mmm.

412
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:14,531
Hey, you know how they did
that? You know what that is?

413
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:15,767
[sighing] No, what?

414
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:18,395
Melted plastic and
microwaved bubble gum.

415
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:20,355
[woman] No way. Really?

416
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:21,999
Really.

417
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:23,668
[phone ringing]

418
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:26,445
- What in the world?
- Do you want me to pause it?

419
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:28,131
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

420
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:32,117
Hello?

421
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:33,994
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

422
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:36,955
Dustin? Is everything okay?

423
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,665
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

424
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,834
I have a science question.

425
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:44,296
It's ten o'clock on
Saturday. Why don't we pick this up...

426
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:47,340
Do you know anything about
sensory deprivation tanks?

427
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:49,217
Specifically how to build one?

428
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:52,280
Sensory deprivation? [stutters]
What is this for?

429
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,556
Fun.

430
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:56,325
Okay. Well...

431
00:25:57,143 --> 00:25:59,561
Why don't we talk about it
Monday? After school, okay?

432
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:02,105
You always say we should
never stop being curious.

433
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:04,107
To always open any
curiosity door we find.

434
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:05,233
Dustin...

435
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,962
Why are you keeping this
curiosity door locked?

436
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:10,489
[sighs]

437
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,782
Uh-huh.

438
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:13,593
[indistinct chatter over phone]

439
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,846
Uh-huh. How much?

440
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:18,806
Uh-huh.

441
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:22,876
Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful.

442
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:24,586
Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke.

443
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:27,170
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday. I'll
see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

444
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,340
Bye.

445
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:30,717
Do you still have that kiddie
pool we bobbed for apples in?

446
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:33,095
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah.

447
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:34,846
Good. Then we just
need salt. Lots of it.

448
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:36,657
How much is "lots"?

449
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:39,827
1,500 pounds.

450
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,622
Well, where are we
gonna get that much salt?

451
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:53,799
[Jonathan grunting]

452
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:58,703
Hey, wait.

453
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,747
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

454
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,916
[sighs] Worst case, no school.

455
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:05,710
Even if we find Will in there...

456
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,337
what are we gonna do about that thing?

457
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:08,713
We're not gonna do anything.

458
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,215
I don't want you anywhere
near this, all right?

459
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:11,826
Your mom's been through enough already.

460
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:12,717
He's my brother.

461
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:16,138
Listen to me. I'm gonna
find him. All right?

462
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:17,764
You gotta trust me on this.

463
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:19,575
I am going to find him.

464
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:28,084
[grunting] This damn thing is heavy.

465
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:36,032
Come on. It's upside down.

466
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,384
[Lucas] No, this way.

467
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:41,746
- Okay, um...
- How does this even work?

468
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,999
- Try that side.
- [grunts] Son of a bitch!

469
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,084
- Pull it back. Pull it back.
- I am!

470
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:48,795
- [Lucas] One, two, three.
- [grunts]

471
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:50,231
Shit!

472
00:27:58,472 --> 00:27:59,848
[grunts] Ah.

473
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,033
[Nancy] Stand back.

474
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,500
Whoa.

475
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:21,203
[Nancy] What did she even eat?

476
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:23,914
- [Mike] What?
- Eleven.

477
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:28,269
[Mike] Oh. Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

478
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,605
She really likes Eggos.

479
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:34,883
[Nancy] I knew you were
acting weird. I just...

480
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,010
I thought it was because of Will.

481
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:39,989
I knew you were acting weird,
too. I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

482
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:42,491
Hey...

483
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,394
No more secrets, okay?

484
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:48,522
From now on we tell
each other everything.

485
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:51,650
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

486
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:53,711
What? No.

487
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,465
No, it's... it's
not... it's not like that.

488
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,283
Do you like Eleven?

489
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:03,721
What? No. Ew. Gross.

490
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,886
This will keep it dark for you.

491
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:22,073
Just like in your bathtub.

492
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:25,100
[sighs]

493
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:26,893
You're a very brave girl.

494
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:28,788
You know that, don't you?

495
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,793
Everything you're
doing for my boy... for Will...

496
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:36,879
for my family...

497
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,905
[sighs]

498
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:41,133
[sniffs] Thank you.

499
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,971
Listen.

500
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:50,333
I am gonna be there with
you the whole time.

501
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:52,377
And if it ever gets too scary...

502
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:56,857
[stutters] in that place,
you just let me know, okay?

503
00:29:59,802 --> 00:30:00,945
Yes.

504
00:30:03,514 --> 00:30:04,657
Ready?

505
00:30:06,142 --> 00:30:07,702
[breath trembling]

506
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:10,621
Ready.

507
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,598
Colder!

508
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:32,852
Warmer!

509
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:36,647
Right there!

510
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:11,849
[static]

511
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,869
[sighs]

512
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:51,764
[electricity surging]

513
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,409
[breathing heavily]

514
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:55,518
Barb?

515
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,871
Barbara?

516
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:01,458
[breathing heavily]

517
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,350
[squelching]

518
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:23,296
[bubbling]

519
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:24,297
[gasps]

520
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:25,840
[breathing heavily]

521
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:27,318
[electricity pulsating]

522
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:30,279
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

523
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:34,265
Is Barb okay? Is she okay?

524
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,351
[screaming] Gone! Gone!

525
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,186
Gone!

526
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:40,939
Gone! Gone!

527
