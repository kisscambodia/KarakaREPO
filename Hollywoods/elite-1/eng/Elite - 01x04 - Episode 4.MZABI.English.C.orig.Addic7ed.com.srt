2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,040
- Press that button.
- What's that?

3
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,640
It's a time machine.

4
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,960
Press that button.

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,720
We're going back in time now.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,880
To last week's Monday.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
To the moment when you told me.

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,040
I am HIV-positive.

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,841
Only, this time, I don't stand like
an idiot, not knowing what to say.

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
I don't care.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,360
That's not true, I do care.
It makes me like you even more.

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,000
Something huge happened to
you and you've overcome it.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,040
It makes me want to know
you more than before.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,120
Have I fixed it? If not
I'll keep trying until I do.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
Nailed it the first time.

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,563
Great, this was a
doorbell for science class,

17
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:43,520
I was never able to make it ring.

18
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
Congratulations, Nadia.

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
This exam deserves a ten.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,080
Well, so did one of your classmates',

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,320
and you know that here
we grade on a curve, so...

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,720
Excuse me, on a what?

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,845
Haven't they explained this to you?

25
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,720
Let me show you. Look.

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,600
This curve maps human intelligence.

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,640
On one end is a minority
with low intellectual ability.

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,200
On the other, there
is another minority...

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
which is extremely intelligent.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
And the majority...

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840
falls here in the middle.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,840
Let's assume the class
is a sample of society.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,640
There are those who have a
ten, and those with a zero.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,560
The rest is distributed here.

35
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:38,576
There can never be
two tens, or two zeros.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,920
So the grades are
assigned before the exam.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,407
That's right. If
you're in the lower 20%,

38
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,500
you fail even if you did well.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,520
- Damn, that's why I always flunk.
- Isn't that a bit unfair?

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Guys, this prepares you for life.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Out there, if you're in the
lowest 20%, you don't get anything.

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,760
And on the podium, there
can't be two people.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,240
If you have any complaints,
come to my office hours.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,360
LEARN ABOUT ADOPTION AND OLDER CHILDREN

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,560
Sorry.

46
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,080
OMAR, ARE YOU THERE? ARE YOU NOT
GOING TO TALK TO ME? FORGIVE ME

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,520
HELLO...

48
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Hello.

49
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,640
- When is our next dinner for three?
- I don't know.

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
The fish was actually
very good the other night,

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
the meat, not so much.

52
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
You didn't even try the meat.

53
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,120
- How about dinner just for the two of us?
- You know that can't be.

54
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
No problem, I'll go on a diet, then.

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,040
Too bad, I was really
looking forward to it.

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
Shame. I am tired of feeling
like a dick with legs.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,440
I am good for a lot more.

58
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,320
It's true. You're right.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,280
Would you like to come to
a party with celebrities?

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,440
It's a benefit cocktail party.

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Some 100 guests gorging
themselves on seafood and champagne

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,480
because they're super
worried about world hunger.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
And, then, with the funds they raise

64
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,360
they buy garbanzo cans for the poor.

65
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Right.

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,960
The truth is, I only go
because my father makes me.

67
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,960
Champagne, luxury, seafood...

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,000
What a drag!

69
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,480
Would you like to come with me?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,240
Would you like me to go?

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Of course.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,850
What can you tell me about Pablo Ruiz?

73
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:59,560
They say you expelled him two years ago

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
for having sex with Marina.

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
She was 14, he 17.

76
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,520
I didn't expel anybody. He left.

77
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
Do you have any way to contact him?

78
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,160
No. Is there anything else?

79
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Is this another plan you
hatched with your friend?

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,200
I don't talk to Lu anymore, Nadia.

81
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,280
I just want to make it up
to you. What I did was wrong.

82
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
I was an asshole.

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
A gift only proves you're
an asshole with money.

84
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
What do you want? I've tried everything.

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I mean it.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,840
Tell me what to do,
so you'll forgive me.

87
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
In my culture...

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,280
you haven't only insulted me,

89
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
but also my family.

90
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,080
- So first you'll have to go through them.
- Sorry?

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Precisely.

92
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,240
Ask their forgiveness. Muslim style.

93
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,360
Go before my parents...

94
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,880
and explain to them that you
tried to take my virginity,

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
to then mock me.

96
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,320
And ask for leniency...

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
- on your knees.
- On my knees?

98
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Is your family from Game of Thrones?

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,120
With this we'll forget about the money.

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
The address is behind the photo.

101
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
No.

102
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,440
No way, I'm not killing anybody.

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,880
Who said anything about
killing? A warning, on the leg.

104
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,320
So he learns he should pay his debts.

105
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
How do you feel?

106
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,360
Like fucking James Bond.

107
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,920
License to brag. But this is too much.

108
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,760
Federico, how about we take
it in a bit more over there?

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,960
He's gonna make you look great.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
No, don't let him fix anything,
or I'll have to buy it.

111
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
The moment he walks in the door,
Federico accepts the charge.

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,840
He's like a plumber, then,
charges just for showing up.

113
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,560
What does a suit made to
measure like this cost?

114
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,120
Don't you worry about that.

115
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,880
He's always worked with us
and gives us a special price.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No way!

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,560
Okay. It's a loan, you'll
repay it when you can.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
So, how much is this suit?

119
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,080
More than 300 bucks?

120
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
More than 500?

121
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
More than one thousand?

122
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,480
Could we have a moment?

123
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,600
I don't care how much it costs.
It's a present, and that's that.

124
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,520
It's not my birthday, or my Saint's day.

125
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,000
I haven't passed all my
classes... or any, for that matter.

126
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,040
What you've given us is
worth much more than a suit.

127
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Before we met you, Polo and
I were not doing very well.

128
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,240
And now, look at us... better than ever.

129
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,400
Since we are here, I can't
imagine 007 with a cheap watch.

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,320
Which one do you like?
This one's cool, huh?

131
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
SO, SHOULD I BUY THE SUIT?

132
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
No! Only those people are attending?

133
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,680
And you're telling me now?

134
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,440
Make something up, tell them there's
canapés, you'll see how many come.

135
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Dad?

136
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,680
- I'm going to need another invitation.
- For whom?

137
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,240
For Samuel, the boy from the party.

138
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Not a chance.

139
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Why not?

140
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,972
I don't want him in the photos,

141
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,776
in case somebody from
the press recognizes him,

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,680
and they start talking about the
school again. Is that reason enough?

143
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,680
When it was good for you, you
wanted to have photos taken with him.

144
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,040
Darling, we organized all of
this to put that issue behind us.

145
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,120
Oh! I thought it was about the homeless.

146
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Marina. We all win here.

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay? I get good press, yes, but
they get a roof over their heads.

148
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Don't they?

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
As long as it doesn't
fall on their heads...

150
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,280
Don't play with tomorrow's event.

151
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,200
OF COURSE, ALREADY HAVE YOUR INVITE

152
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,400
Is my pronunciation that bad?

153
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
Open the door!

154
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,660
What the fuck are you doing here?

155
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,560
I don't give a damn about your friend.

156
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,480
You don't give a damn about Ander,
and I don't give a damn about you.

157
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,480
Are your parents here?
I need to talk to them.

158
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,360
Don't worry. I'm used to
seeing her like this at school.

159
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
What?

160
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Hello.

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,320
Sit with us.

162
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,320
Do you need a fork?

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,176
Well, I've been in Egypt,
but they didn't eat like this.

164
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
What do we have to do with Egypt?

165
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,840
It's mansaf, typical of Palestine.

166
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,160
Thank you. Thank you
for your hospitality.

167
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,560
We would have done it for
anybody who came to our home.

168
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,280
Even if we don't know
what they're here for.

169
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,680
I've come to ask for your forgiveness.
For the other day at the store.

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,360
I wanted to apologize
for trying to deceive...

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Goodbye.

172
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Goodbye.

173
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,950
What do you think you're doing?

174
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,320
And you go and tell my
father about the scarf!

175
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
How could I know you hadn't told him?

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,280
- And I've only done what you asked me for.
- Because I thought you wouldn't dare.

177
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,480
That it was the only
way you'd leave me alone.

178
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,120
Now you know it takes a
lot more to discourage me.

179
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,880
For you, all of this is
just another challenge, huh?

180
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
First, taking my virginity,
now, getting me to forgive you.

181
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,320
What's next, conquering Everest?

182
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
After you, Everest will be nothing.

183
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,280
If you don't want to be a challenge,
why do you make it so hard?

184
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Guzmán.

185
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,920
I don't want anything with you.

186
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,600
Because I think you're a bad person.

187
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Tomorrow...

188
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,760
we organize a benefit gala...

189
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
to raise funds...

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
for the homeless.

191
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,640
Would a bad person do that?

192
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
I don't think so.

193
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
You're invited.

194
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,840
Please, I'll pay you back
when I get paid at La Cabaña.

195
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,828
Samuel, I couldn't lend it
to you even if I wanted to.

196
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:22,720
I don't have that money.

197
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,160
Because you spend it all
on smokes, that's why.

198
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,960
There are factors that give Nadia
an advantage, things that... Lu.

199
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Please.

200
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
She's been able to overcome
all the disadvantages.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Her coming from a worse
school, mid-course...

202
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,440
And is that my fault?

203
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm just trying to balance things,
so there is a little more justice.

204
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,160
That's all. Okay?

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,440
Martín, all of this
about peace in the world...

206
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,200
is it because of the adoption thing?

207
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Sorry?

208
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,040
The webpage open on
your laptop yesterday.

209
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,520
It belonged to a foundation
to adopt older children.

210
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Very generous.

211
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,960
But I think people
prefer small children.

212
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,040
Unless they are not
approved for adoption.

213
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,484
I guess it's because
of your shitty salary

214
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,005
and your wife being unemployed, right?

215
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Have you investigated us?

216
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,800
No, not investigated.

217
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,174
This is the 21st century,

218
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:29,480
and everything is on
social media. For example,

219
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,000
that she hasn't had a job in two
years. That's on her LinkedIn profile.

220
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,920
She's a pre-school teacher,
so she likes children.

221
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,080
According to Facebook you've
been married for eight years...

222
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
and nothing.

223
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,603
And on Twitter she follows

224
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:45,840
all of Spain's adoption
and fostering agencies.

225
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
Um, she seems a bit desperate, right?

226
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
What are you doing, Lucrecia?

227
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,520
My father has excellent
contacts in Mexico.

228
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,120
A pair of phone calls, and you
could have a beautiful child.

229
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,720
Faster than you can have
a pizza at your door.

230
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,400
- Color and size of your choice.
- And of course you want nothing in return.

231
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,600
To be the best beyond any doubt
at the end of the school year.

232
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,560
- Because I am the best.
- Get out.

233
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,760
Not having children can
result in a separation.

234
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,840
And it would be very sad if the
next profile of your wife's I see...

235
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
were on Tinder.

236
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,760
Pablo gave up a scholarship to study
at the best school in the country.

237
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,880
No. Marina's parents
persuaded him to do it.

238
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
How?

239
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,400
With money, what else?

240
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,160
Pablo had sex with a minor.

241
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,514
If they wanted to get rid of him,

242
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:41,500
all they had to do was
report him to the police.

243
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,320
They actually paid him
not to go to the police.

244
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,681
So he wouldn't report what
happened that Monday afternoon.

245
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,960
It's fine, right? As good as new.

246
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,280
It's not swollen. Does it hurt?

247
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes.

248
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,960
I'd be cautious and leave
it bandaged another week.

249
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
Then, if things persist,

250
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,760
we'd run further tests to
see what the problem is.

251
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, that's it, then.

252
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,600
Do you wear your hijab in class?

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,160
Don't lie to me, Nadia.

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Not you.

255
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,880
They forbade it, dad.

256
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,240
I had no choice. I
would have been expelled.

257
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,800
Why do you want to keep attending
a school with those rules?

258
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,520
Because thanks to that school...

259
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,320
I can one day be one of
those who make the rules.

260
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
Not one who needs to obey them.

261
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,280
- Don't let them change you, Nadia.
- Dad, why are you always saying that?

262
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,160
Because they are already doing it.

263
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,080
You didn't use to hide things from us.

264
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
DISCREET19: HELO. WHAT'S UP?

265
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I LIKE YOUR PROFILE SHALL WE MEET?

266
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
What's up, man?

267
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,400
Well. How much was that?

268
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,280
It doesn't matter.
I'll return it tomorrow.

269
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,520
Unbelievable, man.

270
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,840
Since you go to that good
school, you're a total punk.

271
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,480
So, what about this girl?

272
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
- Are you serious?
- You mean Marina?

273
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Of course.

274
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
I don't know, why?

275
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,600
Nothing in particular. It's
just that now you'll ignore me.

276
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,680
Even more. Which is normal,
when one gets a girlfriend.

277
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
What's weird is for a girl to like you.

278
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,840
I had lost hope already.

279
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,680
Get a girlfriend yourself, and
then we can go out together.

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,080
Lu's decided to come.

281
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,480
Hey, if it isn't Miss Mexico!

282
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,320
Look at me, in formal dress!

283
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,960
Like a soap opera leading man from 1999.

284
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,480
- Thank you.
- This is my charitable action for tonight.

285
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,160
Lu, if you're mad at me,
don't take it out on him.

286
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,720
- Why don't we try to have a good time?
- Okay.

287
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,100
But it's quite clear

288
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,720
you don't need me to
have a good time, dear.

289
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,800
Then you're not mad.

290
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
You're jealous.

291
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,520
Let's go, boys.

292
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Pathetic!

293
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,680
Let's talk for a moment, please.

294
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,831
If you want to take your pet for a walk,

295
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,080
that's okay, but not here, Polo.

296
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,560
Guzmán, he's a classmate,
man. It's not a problem.

297
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,002
If you want to ruin everything

298
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,000
by allowing this guy into
your relationship, fine,

299
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,160
but don't bring him here.
Much less in front of me.

300
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
This is Carla's mother's place,

301
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,320
- so I can invite whoever I want.
- Do you invite, or does she?

302
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,680
- You see how she controls you, right?
- You'd rather control me yourself?

303
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,920
I am your best friend
since grade school, moron!

304
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I yours.

305
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,800
And I remind you that together
we've done things I'm not proud of.

306
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,160
Things I haven't told anybody.

307
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,560
And all because of you.

308
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
Don't you ever forget that.

309
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,480
Are you still not talking to me today?

310
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,000
What is this? Miracle of Marcelino?

311
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Please!

312
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,840
Now we just need the Muslim girl.

313
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,560
You didn't invite her, right?

314
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Oh, Guzmán.

315
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
Please! She's not coming, of course.

316
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,640
What happened? Did she give
you the Muslim brush-off?

317
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Great, isn't it?

318
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,440
Looks like we are all
widening our friendship circle.

319
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

320
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Samuel García.

321
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,320
Samuel García...

322
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,800
You're not on the list.

323
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,560
- I'm not invited?
- No.

324
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,840
- What's wrong?
- His name's not on the list.

325
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,240
Do you know who I am?

326
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,160
Gutsy, the hippie. Not
even I dare say that.

327
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,240
Marina, darling, we already said
you couldn't invite any friends.

328
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,120
Mom, he's not my friend.

329
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,920
He's my boyfriend.

330
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Samuel, let's go.

331
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,840
- Where the fuck are you going?
- What are you doing?

332
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Your tag's come out?

333
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh, he was going to return it!

334
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,840
Try not to get it too dirty.

335
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,000
You are an asshole, Guzmán.

336
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
- Samuel.
- What?

337
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Why did you make me
come if I'm not invited?

338
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,880
I was mad that at the other party
you were used for my dad's pictures,

339
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,680
- and you...
- You are the one using me now.

340
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,120
I'm just an excuse to
rebel against your parents.

341
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,820
Look, I had imagined many times

342
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:56,520
the moment when we
decided to be a couple.

343
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Many times.

344
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,600
But it was never like
this, I can assure you.

345
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Do you have your time machine on you?

346
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,240
I'd love to go back...
a half hour, more or less.

347
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,600
Do you like me, Marina?

349
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,681
- If this is about the HIV you can...
- You don't know me.

350
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,720
Do you know what I thought when...

351
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,680
I found out Pablo had infected me?

352
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
That...

353
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,520
somehow that secret, that
thing we both shared...

354
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
would bring us together.

355
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,440
That thanks to the HIV...

356
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,520
we would always be together.

357
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,520
Which was really sick,

358
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
and idiotic.

359
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
And then he left.
Without saying goodbye.

360
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,040
Can I tell you a secret?

361
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,000
You can't travel in time.

362
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,480
Or change the past. So why
not stop looking back...

363
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,640
and start looking forward?

364
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,080
Is this closer to what you had imagined?

365
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,200
You have lipstick.

366
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,560
And you.

367
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,360
Marchioness!

368
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,200
Your winery is the bomb,
and the wine, amazing!

369
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,080
Delicious. By the way, will
there be a proper dinner?

370
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
You wouldn't know how
to choose your cutlery.

371
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
From the outside in.

372
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,520
I've seen Titanic twice.

373
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,640
Don't think you're the only
one who knows about movies.

374
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Hello.

375
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,720
Christian, right? Polo
hasn't talked about you.

376
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,320
- Do you like Las Encinas?
- Yes, actually, I do.

377
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,480
I don't think the school likes me.

378
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,320
I don't pass a single
test, man. And I do try.

379
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
Some business about a curve,
some weird shit they have there.

380
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,400
- What would you like to do?
- I want to be famous.

381
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Famous doing what exactly?

382
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
Good question. The truth
is I don't know yet.

383
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,416
Begoña, you're not up to date.

384
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,480
Nowadays they don't
want to do something.

385
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,300
They just want to be somebody,

386
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:31,800
and the less effort
to get it, the better.

387
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
- Right.
- Mom,

388
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,600
how much effort did it take
to become a marchioness?

389
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,260
Christian, I think it's very good

390
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:40,821
that you want to be somebody important.

391
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,680
That shows ambition.

392
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,080
We'd love that for our son.

393
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Mom!

394
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,960
Dad, the photographers are here.

395
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,160
"WHEN TYRANNY IS LAW
REVOLUTION IS ORDER"

396
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,160
What are you doing here?
Are you here to see Fer?

397
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
What's up?

398
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,160
Need dough, right? Some extra money.

399
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,960
- Who's this?
- He's Nano.

400
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
A friend.

401
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,440
Nano, this is Fer.

402
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
I can give you stuff.

403
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,760
- But that's your territory.
- I don't care.

404
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,200
There's plenty of customers.

405
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,480
You're good to the point of stupid, man.

406
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,360
That's why I like working with him.

407
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,160
With that angel face
nobody thinks he's a dealer.

408
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,720
But you...

409
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,040
I have to go. Hope it goes well.

410
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,040
Can I trust you?

411
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,960
When did you get out?

412
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
It's written all over your face.

413
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Not long ago.

414
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,360
Already trying to go back in?

415
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
What about you?

416
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I have to pay for schools, diapers,

417
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
and...

418
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,600
for a big fat mess I got
into while I was in the can.

419
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
What do you want, pills, coke, pot?

420
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,640
I want you to get your
family and go far away.

421
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,920
Because the next guy they
send won't be as stupid as me.

422
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Hey.

423
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,640
I am Discreet19.

424
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,400
Come on, man, fuck off.

425
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,480
Hey, wait! Let me apologize at least.

426
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,600
- You made me come here for that?
- No.

427
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,320
I made you come for the same
reason I created a fake user-name.

428
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,440
I want to see you.

429
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,920
I want to be with you.

430
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
Kiss you, finish what we started.

431
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
Don't you?

432
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,744
This is what I get

433
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:58,026
for agreeing to see someone
who spells hello with one "L."

434
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,120
Besides, if you leave...

435
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,880
you won't know what the 19 is about.

436
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
It is not my age.

437
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,320
If the 19 business is as
real as the discreet...

438
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,560
- There must be cameras here.
- I know some hideouts.

439
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
He's an ace.

440
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:41,160
- He is, better than his father.
- Excuse me.

441
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,160
What do you mean
"better than his father"?

442
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,960
- We are improving the species.
- Okay, then, my son is better than me.

443
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,160
By the way...

444
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,800
I LOVED IT, THANK YOU FOR THE
PRESENT. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT

445
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,560
ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU COME HERE?

446
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,400
Do you want to find out
if it's a girl or a boy?

447
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,280
- I'm going to the bathroom, okay?
- Sure.

448
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What are you doing here?

449
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
It can't be.

450
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
What can't be?

451
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,313
That your athlete friend is gay?

452
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:52,280
Or that he's involved with
a Muslim from the hood?

453
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,200
- He could have told me, he's my friend.
- That's what I was thinking, too.

454
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Let them be.

455
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,080
- I'll pay you for the suit tomorrow.
- Don't worry about it.

456
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,160
Your parents... are mothers.

457
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,360
They are two mothers.
Which is totally fine by me.

458
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,162
I love lesbians, I could say I'm a fan.

459
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:23,800
I never miss any of their movies.

460
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
You can keep them.

461
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,960
Come on, my parents are tough on me too.

462
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,720
Would they also like you to be a
writer, or a musician, an artist?

463
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Somebody important, I mean.

464
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,825
No, not at all. They'd be happy

465
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,746
if I don't end up on the
streets, under a bridge.

466
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
I see.

467
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,200
At least they don't constantly
remind you that you disappoint them.

468
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,420
No.

469
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,915
It's much better to
be constantly reminded

470
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,360
that you're good for nothing.

471
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,400
And that they don't
expect anything from you.

472
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,230
My mother is tired of showing off

473
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:53,400
the winery and now she wants to show us.

474
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,640
She wants to introduce
us to some friends.

475
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,960
Shit, if they were famous, at
least. But I don't know any of them.

476
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,800
The whole room may not even
add up to 10.000 followers!

477
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,080
- They are waiting for us.
- With all due respect...

478
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Fuck them!

479
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,200
Let's go to your apartment and
finish the party there. I'm hungry.

480
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Come on!

481
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Marchioness, thank you very much.

482
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,960
It's been a pleasure. I love
your winery, it's the bomb.

483
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,440
I'm leaving.

484
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,360
Thank you for the cava, marchioness!

485
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Carla!

486
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,320
Come on!

487
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Hey.

488
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,920
Why the hurry to see me? What
is it? Did you and Marina do it?

489
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,080
Careful, I don't want details.

490
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
How was your night?

491
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,800
More boring than yours,
I'm sure. At home.

492
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,040
Omar, I know.

493
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,440
And I'm not the only
one, Guzmán also knows.

494
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,160
What I don't know is
why you haven't told me.

495
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,760
I only do it to make some
money. Don't freak out.

496
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Do you charge?

497
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,360
Of course! Did you expect
me to do it for free?

498
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,120
An NGO, "Dealers without  Borders."

499
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,920
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

500
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Omar, how could you get into that shit?

501
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,560
I told you, Samu.

502
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,456
You are not the only one with
friends at the new school.

503
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Yeah, but those friends you made
will make you end up like my brother.

504
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,200
- Is that what you want?
- No.

505
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,560
- I want to make some money, that's all.
- Then go and serve burgers.

506
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
Like I do.

507
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,960
I should remind you that we took
our resumes to La Cabaña together.

508
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,280
But who did they call?
Not the Muslim boy.

509
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,000
It's true, the Muslim boy
can only deal drugs, right?

510
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,480
No, it's not that.

511
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,080
- But that's easy for you to say.
- No, nothing's easy for me.

512
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
Nor for your sister.

513
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Look at where she is and where you are.

514
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,440
Why don't you fuck off with
your fucking girlfriend...

515
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
and leave me alone, huh?

516
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Nice hijab.

517
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
I wish I could say the
same about your shades.

518
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,360
They're for the hangover.

519
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,480
So, did you have a good time?

520
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,880
Did you raise a lot of money?

521
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,200
It doesn't matter. It was all a farce.

522
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,280
- How come?
- Just marketing for my father's company.

523
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I knew it.

524
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,560
And I participated, as usual.

525
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,800
It was also so you
would forgive me, Nadia.

526
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,800
If I were your father, I
wouldn't let you date me either.

527
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,200
Who said anything about dating?

528
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Okay.

529
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
Friends, then.

530
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,720
I could use one, I don't
know if I have any left.

531
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,800
If you are trying to
get me to pity you...

532
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm not trying anything, Nadia.

533
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,680
There's no plan, no strategy.
I don't want you to forgive me.

534
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
I don't deserve it.

535
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,600
I don't deserve you.

536
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Now you do.

537
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,080
After...

538
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,680
a complaint during office hours,
I've decided to change the grades.

539
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,760
Nadia, you have a nine point five now.

540
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,040
Um, well... I'd also
like to file a complaint.

541
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,600
I've already decided.
No need to go over it.

542
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm very sorry.

543
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,040
Besides, being second in
your class is no tragedy.

544
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,840
Let's continue...

545
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,520
What happened on the
afternoon of April 12, 2016?

546
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,240
And don't say you don't remember.

547
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
An incident took place.

548
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,370
A fight.

549
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,720
From what I know, this
was more of a beating.

550
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
Who was involved?

551
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Pablo,

552
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,640
and other students from the school.

553
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,280
And why say nothing until now?

554
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Because...

555
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
one of those students is my son.

556
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Hey.

557
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,680
I'm sorry about last night, man.

558
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,040
I got to the party, but
saw you with other people...

559
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,560
I got bored and left.

560
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,840
- Don't you ever get tired of lying?
- What?

561
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,160
Do you think at this point
anybody cares if you are into guys?

562
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,440
- No.
- Ah.

563
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,680
Then why do you act so weird?

564
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,600
Why are you avoiding us?

565
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,880
Why the fuck are you using?

566
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,640
Ander!

567
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
- Calm down.
- Let go of me!

568
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,920
- Easy. Look at me.
- It doesn't hurt!

569
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,760
It doesn't hurt, Guzmán! Let go of me.

570
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Look at me! Calm down.

571
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,480
Do you think you're the only one I
lie to? I've been lying for years!

572
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,400
- Years, I have a lot of practice!
- What are you talking about?

573
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,320
Ander, the tennis player. It
feels like my fucking last name!

574
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,000
Well, I don't like it! You
know? I don't like it one bit.

575
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,920
And why don't you leave it?

576
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,160
What about my parents? All
the money they've spent on me.

577
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
All those years of
sacrifice, for nothing.

578
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,160
I don't know where he is.

579
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,400
A neighbor saw him leaving this morning.

580
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,240
Suitcases and all.

581
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,120
Bad luck for us, huh?

582
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,760
And good luck for you.

583
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,920
I tried, but...

584
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Oh, well.

585
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Come on.

586
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,480
Don't worry. We'll
see if we can find him.

587
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,560
Damn. Boy, are we good!

588
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Was it that hard to do
what was asked of you?

589
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
No.

590
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,680
Do you know what this will cost
you now? Another 20.000 bucks.

591
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,440
If you raise my debt, how
do you expect me to pay?

592
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,200
I'm not here to give you advice.

593
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,240
I'm here to give you a warning.

594
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,600
The last one.

595
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,320
Press the button.

596
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,760
Press it, and travel
to whenever you want.

597
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,400
Shall I walk you home?

598
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Okay.

599
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,960
Give me five minutes.

600
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,220
Shit.

601
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,960
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

602
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,600
Nothing. Where are my mother and Samu?

603
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,240
Your mother's at work, and Samu
in the bathroom. Shall I call him?

604
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
No, they will ask questions. Help me up.

605
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,040
Okay, come on.

606
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,240
- Shit.
- Come on.

607
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,920
Come on.

608
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
Let's see.

609
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,760
- Shit! You have to go to a hospital.
- No.

610
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,280
This is just a warning
cut. Maybe next time.

611
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,160
You have to tell them
who did this to you.

612
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,360
No. They did this because
I owe 40.000 bucks.

613
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,640
You got stabbed for owing
40.000 miserable euros?

614
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,960
Look, in the real world...

615
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,200
people kill for less, you know?

616
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,640
Even if it's small change to you.

617
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,640
I don't know. There must be a
way to get that fucking money.

618
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,240
Nano, I'm going to help you.

619
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
How?

620
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,200
For now I am happy if you
don't tell my brother, okay?

621
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
What's going on?

622
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,920
Nothing, a couple of...

623
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,560
beers too many, and
they went to my head.

624
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,880
Let's go, he's a little drunk.

625
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Yeah.

626
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,120
Let's go.

627
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,000
Nothing. Nothing has
been published anywhere.

628
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,720
There aren't any more news in the
newspapers. It's all YouTube clips.

629
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,120
- And fucking gossip.
- Well.

630
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,880
Don't worry, you did what you could.

631
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,360
I did, unlike others.

632
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
- What have I done now?
- The scene you made over your boyfriend?

633
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,200
He's a child.

634
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,840
Who's not ready to...

635
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,120
Who's not ready to be in
a relationship with you.

636
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
He knows, mom.

637
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
And he doesn't care.

638
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,360
He doesn't care how I got
infected. Or who I did it with.

639
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,480
Or what stupid things I've done.

640
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,280
He doesn't look at me
as if I had the plague.

641
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,760
- The way you do.
- Do you have complaints about us?

642
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,741
About how we deal with all
the problems you bring us,

643
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,680
day in and day out?

644
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,520
All the ways you've found
to fuck with our lives?

645
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,120
Why don't you leave her alone?

646
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,480
I did not expect this from you, Guzmán.

647
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,280
People surprise you.

648
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,600
I haven't seen her smile
like this in a long time.

649
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,720
So if she's happy with him,
it's not the end of the world.

650
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,050
That afternoon, you, Polo, and Guzmán

651
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,920
waited for Pablo to get out of class.

652
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,120
But that has no bearing
on what has happened.

653
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,560
Was Guzmán very angry?

654
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,400
He had just found out that
guy had infected his sister.

655
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,560
What did you do to him?

656
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,880
Hey, Pablito.

657
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,240
He got a couple of punches.

658
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,560
Guzmán found out that his
sister was about to run away

659
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,160
with a boy that had impregnated
her, a boy like Pablo.

660
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,961
What if he confronted her in
a fit of rage and killed her?

661
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,080
He says he's incapable of
doing something like that.

662
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,800
That he barely touched Pablo.

663
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,200
Tell me the truth.

664
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Is that true?

665
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,560
Guzmán!

666
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,880
It's true.

667
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,080
He barely touched him.
