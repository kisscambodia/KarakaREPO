1
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,570
<font color="#616161">I can't let you out, Hedwig.</font>

2
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,570
<font color="#616161">I'm not allowed to use
magic outside of school.</font>

3
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,570
<font color="#616161">~ Besides, if Uncle Vernon....
~ Harry Potter!</font>

4
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,570
<font color="#616161">Now you've done it.</font>

5
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,570
<font color="#616161">He's in there. Vernon?</font>

6
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:40,434
<font color="#616161">I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, 
it'll have to go.</font>

7
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,394
<font color="#616161">But she's bored.</font>

8
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:47,065
<font color="#616161">If I could only let her
out for an hour or two.</font>

9
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,195
<font color="#616161">So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.</font>

10
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,491
<font color="#616161">But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends.</font>

11
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,327
<font color="#616161">Not one....</font>

12
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,204
<font color="#616161">....all summer.</font>

13
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,624
<font color="#616161">Who would want to be
friends with you?</font>

14
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,337
<font color="#616161">I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.</font>

15
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:12,007
<font color="#616161">We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food 
off our table....</font>

16
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,301
<font color="#616161">....even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom....</font>

17
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,012
<font color="#616161">....purely out of the
goodness of our hearts.</font>

18
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,681
<font color="#616161">Not now. It's for when
the Masons arrive.</font>

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,185
<font color="#616161">Which should be any minute.</font>

20
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,688
<font color="#616161">Now, let's go over our
schedule once again, shall we?</font>

21
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,774
<font color="#616161">Petunia, when the Masons
arrive, you will be....?</font>

22
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,653
<font color="#616161">In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.</font>

23
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,740
<font color="#616161">~ Good. And, Dudley, you will be....?
~ I'll be waiting to open the door.</font>

24
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,825
<font color="#616161">Excellent.</font>

25
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,207
<font color="#616161">And you?</font>

26
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,170
<font color="#616161">I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that 
I don't exist.</font>

27
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,047
<font color="#616161">Too right, you will.</font>

28
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,717
<font color="#616161">With any luck, this could be the day I make the biggest 
deal of my career....</font>

29
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,429
<font color="#616161">....and you will not mess it up.</font>

30
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:15,404
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter, such
an honor it is.</font>

31
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:23,203
<font color="#616161">~ Who are you? 
~ Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.</font>

32
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,289
<font color="#616161">Not to be rude or anything....</font>

33
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,418
<font color="#616161">....but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf 
in my bedroom.</font>

34
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,087
<font color="#616161">Yes, sir. Dobby understands.</font>

35
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,382
<font color="#616161">It's just that Dobby has
come to tell you....</font>

36
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,387
<font color="#616161">It is difficult, sir. Dobby wonders where to begin.</font>

37
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:46,351
<font color="#616161">~ Why don't you sit down?
~ Sit down? Sit down?</font>

38
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:54,109
<font color="#616161">Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything.</font>

39
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,445
<font color="#616161">Offend Dobby?</font>

40
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,947
<font color="#616161">Dobby has heard of
your greatness, sir....</font>

41
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:04,912
<font color="#616161">....but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, 
like an equal.</font>

42
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,457
<font color="#616161">You can't have met many
decent wizards then.</font>

43
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,043
<font color="#616161">No, I haven't.</font>

44
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,962
<font color="#616161">That was an awful thing to say.</font>

45
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,091
<font color="#616161">~ Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
~ Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.</font>

46
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,635
<font color="#616161">Dobby, please, stop.</font>

47
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,767
<font color="#616161">Don't mind that.
It's just the cat.</font>

48
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,232
<font color="#616161">~ Bad Dobby. 
~ Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.</font>

49
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,692
<font color="#616161">Are you all right?</font>

50
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,321
<font color="#616161">Dobby had to punish
himself, sir.</font>

51
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,699
<font color="#616161">Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.</font>

52
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,828
<font color="#616161">~ Your family? 
~ The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.</font>

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,998
<font color="#616161">Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.</font>

54
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,709
<font color="#616161">If they ever knew Dobby was here....</font>

55
00:04:54,336 --> 00:05:00,133
<font color="#616161">But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. 
To warn him.</font>

56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,594
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must not go back....</font>

57
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:07,474
<font color="#616161">....to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.</font>

58
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,813
<font color="#616161">There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.</font>

59
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,316
<font color="#616161">What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?</font>

60
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,653
<font color="#616161">Can't say.</font>

61
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:25,826
<font color="#616161">~ Okay, I understand. You can't say. 
~ Don't make me talk. L....</font>

62
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,539
<font color="#616161">~ Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down. 
~ Bad Dobby.</font>

63
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,751
<font color="#616161">So when they arrive at the ninth hole....</font>

64
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,923
<font color="#616161">Give me the lamp.</font>

65
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,052
<font color="#616161">Dobby, stop!</font>

66
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,224
<font color="#616161">~ Let me go.
~ Get in there and keep quiet.</font>

67
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:53,437
<font color="#616161">~ What the devil are you doing up here? 
~ I was just....</font>

68
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,356
<font color="#616161">You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke.</font>

69
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,358
<font color="#616161">Sorry.</font>

70
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,989
<font color="#616161">One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy.</font>

71
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,951
<font color="#616161">~ And fix that door.
~ Yes, sir.</font>

72
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,872
<font color="#616161">See why I've got to go back?</font>

73
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,792
<font color="#616161">I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.</font>

74
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,589
<font color="#616161">~ It's the only place I've got friends. 
~ Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?</font>

75
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,675
<font color="#616161">Well, I expect they've been....</font>

76
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:28,514
<font color="#616161">Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?</font>

77
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,059
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.</font>

78
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,438
<font color="#616161">Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him....</font>

79
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:40,275
<font color="#616161">....Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.</font>

80
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,864
<font color="#616161">~ Give me those. Now.
~ No!</font>

81
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,463
<font color="#616161">Dobby, get back here.</font>

82
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,970
<font color="#616161">Dobby, please, no.</font>

83
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,307
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.</font>

84
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,102
<font color="#616161">I can't. Hogwarts is my home.</font>

85
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:21,358
<font color="#616161">Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.</font>

86
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:26,530
<font color="#616161">It spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of 
this building.</font>

87
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,657
<font color="#616161">One plumber said, "Look at all that water."</font>

88
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,827
<font color="#616161">The second plumber said, "Yes, and that's just the top of it."</font>

89
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,676
<font color="#616161">I'm so sorry. It's my nephew. He's very disturbed.</font>

90
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:52,181
<font color="#616161">Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs.</font>

91
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,361
<font color="#616161">You're never going
back to that school.</font>

92
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:11,575
<font color="#616161">You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!</font>

93
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,872
<font color="#616161">Hiya, Harry.</font>

94
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:04,419
<font color="#616161">Ron. Fred. George. What
are you all doing here?</font>

95
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,465
<font color="#616161">Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on, get your trunk.</font>

96
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,890
<font color="#616161">You better stand back.</font>

97
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,434
<font color="#616161">Let's go.</font>

98
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,108
<font color="#616161">~ What was that?
~ What was it?</font>

99
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,612
<font color="#616161">Potter!</font>

100
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,447
<font color="#616161">Dad, what's going on?</font>

101
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,743
<font color="#616161">Go. Go. Go.</font>

102
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,953
<font color="#616161">Dad, hurry up.</font>

103
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,999
<font color="#616161">~ Come on.
~ Come on, Harry, hurry up.</font>

104
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,794
<font color="#616161">Petunia, he's escaping!</font>

105
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,506
<font color="#616161">~ I've got you, Harry.
~ Come here!</font>

106
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,800
<font color="#616161">~ Let go of me!
~ No, boy!</font>

107
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,970
<font color="#616161">You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere.</font>

108
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,763
<font color="#616161">~ Get off!
~ Drive!</font>

109
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,807
<font color="#616161">~ Right.
~ Right!</font>

110
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,642
<font color="#616161">No! No! No! No!</font>

111
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,815
<font color="#616161">Dad!</font>

112
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,451
<font color="#616161">Damn.</font>

113
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,459
<font color="#616161">By the way, Harry, Happy Birthday.</font>

114
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,570
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

115
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,200
<font color="#616161">Okay, come on.</font>

116
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,245
<font color="#616161">Okay, come on.</font>

117
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,549
<font color="#616161">~ Think it'd be all right if we had some? 
~ Yeah, Mum will never know.</font>

118
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,443
<font color="#616161">It's not much, but it's home.</font>

119
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,904
<font color="#616161">I think it's brilliant.</font>

120
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:40,409
<font color="#616161">Where have you been?</font>

121
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,871
<font color="#616161">Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.</font>

122
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,624
<font color="#616161">Beds empty. No note. Car gone.</font>

123
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,794
<font color="#616161">You could have died. You
could have been seen.</font>

124
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,006
<font color="#616161">Of course, I don't blame
you, Harry, dear.</font>

125
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,217
<font color="#616161">They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window.</font>

126
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:02,139
<font color="#616161">Well, you best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley.</font>

127
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,433
<font color="#616161">Come on, Harry, time for
a spot of breakfast.</font>

128
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:08,353
<font color="#616161">Here we are, Harry.
Now, tuck in.</font>

129
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,107
<font color="#616161">That's it. There we go.</font>

130
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:16,111
<font color="#616161">~ Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
~ Yes, dear, it was on the cat.</font>

131
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,363
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

132
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,077
<font color="#616161">What did I do?</font>

133
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,832
<font color="#616161">Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really.</font>

134
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,627
<font color="#616161">~ Morning, Weasleys.
~ Morning, Dad.</font>

135
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,340
<font color="#616161">~ What a night. Nine raids. Nine! 
~ Raids?</font>

136
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,469
<font color="#616161">Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of 
Muggle Artifacts Office.</font>

137
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,972
<font color="#616161">Dad loves Muggles, thinks  they're fascinating.</font>

138
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,350
<font color="#616161">Well, now.</font>

139
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,478
<font color="#616161">And who are you?</font>

140
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,815
<font color="#616161">Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir. Harry Potter.</font>

141
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,110
<font color="#616161">Good Lord. Are you really?</font>

142
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:01,990
<font color="#616161">Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?</font>

143
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,659
<font color="#616161">This morning.</font>

144
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:09,039
<font color="#616161">Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and 
back last night.</font>

145
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,668
<font color="#616161">Did you really? How did it go?</font>

146
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:17,673
<font color="#616161">I mean.... That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.</font>

147
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,845
<font color="#616161">Now, Harry, you must
know all about Muggles.</font>

148
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:27,140
<font color="#616161">Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?</font>

149
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,481
<font color="#616161">Well, that'll be
Errol with the post.</font>

150
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,031
<font color="#616161">Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?</font>

151
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,577
<font color="#616161">~ Errol.
~ He's always doing that.</font>

152
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,207
<font color="#616161">Look, it's our Hogwarts letters. They've sent us Harry's as well.</font>

153
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,419
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore must know you're here. Doesn't miss a trick, 
that man.</font>

154
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,546
<font color="#616161">~ No.
~ This lot won't come cheap.</font>

155
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:02,050
<font color="#616161">~ The spell books alone are expensive. 
~ We'll manage.</font>

156
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,014
<font color="#616161">There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.</font>

157
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,641
<font color="#616161">Right.</font>

158
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,935
<font color="#616161">Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.</font>

159
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,063
<font color="#616161">But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum.</font>

160
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,273
<font color="#616161">Floo powder?</font>

161
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,736
<font color="#616161">You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes.</font>

162
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,238
<font color="#616161">In you go.</font>

163
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,282
<font color="#616161">That's it.</font>

164
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,496
<font color="#616161">Diagon Alley.</font>

165
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,047
<font color="#616161">You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on.</font>

166
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,008
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

167
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,386
<font color="#616161">In you go. That's it.
Mind your head.</font>

168
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,973
<font color="#616161">That's right. Now,
take your Floo powder.</font>

169
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,977
<font color="#616161">That's it, very good.</font>

170
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:58,482
<font color="#616161">Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.</font>

171
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,694
<font color="#616161">Diagonally.</font>

172
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,578
<font color="#616161">~ What did he say, dear?
~ Diagonally.</font>

173
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:12,830
<font color="#616161">I thought he did.</font>

174
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:43,129
<font color="#616161">~ Not lost, are you, my dear? 
~ I'm fine, thank you. I was just going....</font>

175
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:48,800
<font color="#616161">Come with us. We'll help
you find your way back.</font>

176
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,678
<font color="#616161">~ No. Please....
~ Harry?</font>

177
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,930
<font color="#616161">Hagrid!</font>

178
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,099
<font color="#616161">What do you think you're
doing down here? Come on.</font>

179
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:07,152
<font color="#616161">You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.</font>

180
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,323
<font color="#616161">Don't want no one to see you there. People will think you're up 
to no good.</font>

181
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,742
<font color="#616161">I was lost, I....</font>

182
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,870
<font color="#616161">Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?</font>

183
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:22,167
<font color="#616161">Me? I was.... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.</font>

184
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,254
<font color="#616161">They're ruining all
the school cabbages.</font>

185
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,845
<font color="#616161">Harry. Hagrid.</font>

186
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,471
<font color="#616161">Hello, Hermione.</font>

187
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,474
<font color="#616161">~ It's so good to see you.
~ It's great to see you too.</font>

188
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,727
<font color="#616161">What did you do to your glasses?</font>

189
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,772
<font color="#616161">Oculus Reparo.</font>

190
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,987
<font color="#616161">I definitely need to
remember that one.</font>

191
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,866
<font color="#616161">You'll be all right now then,
Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it.</font>

192
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,492
<font color="#616161">~ Okay, bye.
~ Thank you. Bye.</font>

193
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,661
<font color="#616161">Come on, everyone's
been so worried.</font>

194
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,506
<font color="#616161">Harry.</font>

195
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,885
<font color="#616161">Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.</font>

196
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,888
<font color="#616161">Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.</font>

197
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,348
<font color="#616161">Here he is.</font>

198
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,979
<font color="#616161">Mum fancies him.</font>

199
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,399
<font color="#616161">Make way there, please. Let me by, madam. Thank you.</font>

200
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:31,028
<font color="#616161">Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.</font>

201
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,076
<font color="#616161">It can't be. Harry Potter?</font>

202
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,497
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter!</font>

203
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,873
<font color="#616161">Excuse me, madam.</font>

204
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,712
<font color="#616161">Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page.</font>

205
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,049
<font color="#616161">Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is.</font>

206
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,636
<font color="#616161">When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning....</font>

207
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,890
<font color="#616161">....to purchase my
autobiography, Magical Me....</font>

208
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,271
<font color="#616161">....which, incidentally, is currently celebrating....</font>

209
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:11,276
<font color="#616161">....its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list....</font>

210
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:15,948
<font color="#616161">....he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving....</font>

211
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:22,037
<font color="#616161">....with my entire
collected works....</font>

212
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,832
<font color="#616161">....free of charge.</font>

213
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,253
<font color="#616161">Now, ladies?</font>

214
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,589
<font color="#616161">Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed.</font>

215
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:36,260
<font color="#616161">All of you wait outside.
That's it.</font>

216
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,063
<font color="#616161">I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?</font>

217
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,734
<font color="#616161">Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a bookshop without making 
the front page.</font>

218
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,070
<font color="#616161">Leave him alone.</font>

219
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,740
<font color="#616161">Look, Potter. You've got
yourself a girlfriend.</font>

220
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,953
<font color="#616161">Now, now, Draco, play nicely.</font>

221
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,580
<font color="#616161">Mr. Potter.</font>

222
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,003
<font color="#616161">Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.</font>

223
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,380
<font color="#616161">Forgive me.</font>

224
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,800
<font color="#616161">Your scar is legend.</font>

225
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,595
<font color="#616161">As, of course, is the
wizard who gave it to you.</font>

226
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,097
<font color="#616161">Voldemort killed my parents.</font>

227
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,644
<font color="#616161">He was nothing more
than a murderer.</font>

228
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,607
<font color="#616161">You must be very brave
to mention his name.</font>

229
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,609
<font color="#616161">Or very foolish.</font>

230
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,571
<font color="#616161">Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.</font>

231
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:42,451
<font color="#616161">And you must be Miss Granger.</font>

232
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:49,583
<font color="#616161">Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents.</font>

233
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:57,674
<font color="#616161">Muggles, aren't they?</font>

234
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:05,724
<font color="#616161">Let me see. Red hair,
vacant expressions....</font>

235
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,479
<font color="#616161">....tatty, secondhand book.</font>

236
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,024
<font color="#616161">You must be the Weasleys.</font>

237
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,485
<font color="#616161">It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.</font>

238
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:20,364
<font color="#616161">~ Well, well, well.
~ Weasley senior. ~ Lucius.</font>

239
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:25,244
<font color="#616161">Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?</font>

240
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,746
<font color="#616161">I do hope they're
paying you overtime....</font>

241
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,083
<font color="#616161">....but judging by the state of this, I'd say not.</font>

242
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,630
<font color="#616161">What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard....</font>

243
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,882
<font color="#616161">....if they don't even
pay you well for it?</font>

244
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:44,179
<font color="#616161">We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of 
wizard, Malfoy.</font>

245
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,223
<font color="#616161">Clearly.</font>

246
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:52,020
<font color="#616161">Associating with Muggles.</font>

247
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,821
<font color="#616161">And I thought your family could sink no lower.</font>

248
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,910
<font color="#616161">I'll see you at work.</font>

249
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,417
<font color="#616161">See you at school.

250
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,927
<font color="#616161">~ 10:58, come on. 
~ The train will be leaving any moment.</font>

251
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,389
<font color="#616161">Fred, George, Percy, you first.</font>

252
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,605
<font color="#616161">Okay.</font>

253
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,404
<font color="#616161">After you, dear.</font>

254
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,784
<font color="#616161">Come on, Ginny, we'll
get you a seat. Hurry.</font>

255
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,163
<font color="#616161">Let's go.</font>

256
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,263
<font color="#616161">~ What do you two think you're doing? 
~ Sorry.</font>

257
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,683
<font color="#616161">Lost control of the trolley.</font>

258
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,354
<font color="#616161">~ Why can't we get through?
~ I don't know.</font>

259
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,899
<font color="#616161">The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.</font>

260
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:24,196
<font color="#616161">The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it.</font>

261
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:27,741
<font color="#616161">Harry, if we can't get through....</font>

262
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,702
<font color="#616161">....maybe Mum and Dad
can't get back.</font>

263
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:35,123
<font color="#616161">Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.</font>

264
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,501
<font color="#616161">The car.</font>

265
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,181
<font color="#616161">Ron, I should tell you....</font>

266
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:55,143
<font color="#616161">....most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.</font>

267
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,395
<font color="#616161">Right.</font>

268
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:57,729
<font color="#616161">Okay.</font>

269
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,333
<font color="#616161">Oh, no! The Invisibility
Booster must be faulty.</font>

270
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,920
<font color="#616161">Come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train.</font>

271
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,380
<font color="#616161">Okay.</font>

272
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:36,351
<font color="#616161">All we need to do is
catch up with the train.</font>

273
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,187
<font color="#616161">We can't be far behind.</font>

274
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,900
<font color="#616161">~ Do you hear that?
~ We must be getting close.</font>

275
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,444
<font color="#616161">Hold on.</font>

276
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,931
<font color="#616161">Harry!</font>

277
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,393
<font color="#616161">Hold on!</font>

278
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,233
<font color="#616161">Take my hand!</font>

279
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:29,738
<font color="#616161">Hold on!</font>

280
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:33,492
<font color="#616161">I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.</font>

281
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,383
<font color="#616161">~ I think we found the train.
~ Yeah.</font>

282
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,317
<font color="#616161">Welcome home.</font>

283
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,668
<font color="#616161">Up! Up!</font>

284
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,796
<font color="#616161">It's not working!</font>

285
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,303
<font color="#616161">Up! Ron, mind that tree!</font>

286
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:39,683
<font color="#616161">Stop! Stop! Stop!</font>

287
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:07,419
<font color="#616161">~ My wand. Look at my wand. 
~ Be thankful it's not your neck.</font>

288
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,049
<font color="#616161">~ What's happening?
~ I don't know.</font>

289
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,628
<font color="#616161">Come on, go! Fast!</font>

290
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,790
<font color="#616161">Scabbers, you're okay.</font>

291
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,335
<font color="#616161">The car!</font>

292
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,644
<font color="#616161">Dad's gonna kill me.</font>

293
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:58,530
<font color="#616161">See you, Hedwig.</font>

294
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:02,201
<font color="#616161">So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom....</font>

295
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,329
<font color="#616161">....we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4....</font>

296
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:08,749
<font color="#616161">....we almost get killed by a tree....</font>

297
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:12,461
<font color="#616161">Clearly someone doesn't
want me here this year.</font>

298
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:19,009
<font color="#616161">Well, take a good look, lads.</font>

299
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:23,096
<font color="#616161">This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.</font>

300
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,394
<font color="#616161">Oh, dear, we are in trouble.</font>

301
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:35,059
<font color="#616161">You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.</font>

302
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:39,071
<font color="#616161">Do you have any idea
how serious this is?</font>

303
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,617
<font color="#616161">You have risked the
exposure of our world.</font>

304
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,204
<font color="#616161">Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow....</font>

305
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:50,541
<font color="#616161">....that's been on these grounds since before you were born.</font>

306
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,545
<font color="#616161">Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.</font>

307
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:55,879
<font color="#616161">Silence.</font>

308
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:03,263
<font color="#616161">I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested 
with me....</font>

309
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,225
<font color="#616161">....the both of you would be on the train home tonight.</font>

310
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:11,645
<font color="#616161">~ As it is....
~ They are not.</font>

311
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:17,901
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.</font>

312
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:19,778
<font color="#616161">Headmaster....</font>

313
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:24,741
<font color="#616161">....these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction 
of Underage Wizardry.</font>

314
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,829
<font color="#616161">~ As such.... 
~ I am well aware of our bylaws....</font>

315
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,874
<font color="#616161">....having written quite
a few of them myself.</font>

316
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,460
<font color="#616161">However, as head of
Gryffindor house....</font>

317
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:40,632
<font color="#616161">....it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.</font>

318
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,260
<font color="#616161">We'll go and get our stuff, then.</font>

319
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,888
<font color="#616161">What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?</font>

320
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,265
<font color="#616161">You're going to expel us, aren't you?</font>

321
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,936
<font color="#616161">Not today, Mr. Weasley....</font>

322
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:58,108
<font color="#616161">....but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what 
you have done.</font>

323
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,280
<font color="#616161">I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.</font>

324
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,140
<font color="#616161">Morning, everyone.</font>

325
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,352
<font color="#616161">~ Good morning, everyone. 
~ Good morning, Professor Sprout.</font>

326
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,814
<font color="#616161">Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone.</font>

327
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,817
<font color="#616161">Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.</font>

328
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:44,988
<font color="#616161">Who here can tell me the
properties of the Mandrake root?</font>

329
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,990
<font color="#616161">Yes, Miss Granger?</font>

330
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,493
<font color="#616161">Mandrake, or Mandragora....</font>

331
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,665
<font color="#616161">....is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state.</font>

332
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:59,837
<font color="#616161">It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who 
hears it.</font>

333
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,840
<font color="#616161">Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.</font>

334
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,676
<font color="#616161">As our Mandrakes are 
still only seedlings....</font>

335
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,761
<font color="#616161">....their cries won't kill you yet.</font>

336
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:11,723
<font color="#616161">But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have 
given you earmuffs.....</font>

337
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,392
<font color="#616161">....for auditory protection.</font>

338
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:18,021
<font color="#616161">So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly.</font>

339
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,983
<font color="#616161">Flaps tight down, and
watch me closely.</font>

340
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:24,152
<font color="#616161">You grasp your Mandrake firmly.</font>

341
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,322
<font color="#616161">You pull it sharply
up out of the pot.</font>

342
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,495
<font color="#616161">Got it? And....</font>

343
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,831
<font color="#616161">....now you dunk it down
into the other pot....</font>

344
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:40,711
<font color="#616161">....and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.</font>

345
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,551
<font color="#616161">Longbottom's been
neglecting his earmuffs.</font>

346
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:52,014
<font color="#616161">~ No, ma'am, he's just fainted. 
~ Yes, well, just leave him there.</font>

347
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,934
<font color="#616161">Right, on we go. Plenty
of pots to go around.</font>

348
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:59,688
<font color="#616161">Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.</font>

349
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,415
<font color="#616161">~ There's Nearly Headless Nick.
~ Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.</font>

350
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:21,126
<font color="#616161">Hello, Sir Nicholas.</font>

351
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:35,891
<font color="#616161">Say it. I'm doomed.</font>

352
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,644
<font color="#616161">~ You're doomed.
~ Hi, Harry.</font>

353
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,607
<font color="#616161">I'm Colin Creevey. I'm
in Gryffindor too.</font>

354
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,400
<font color="#616161">Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.</font>

355
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,778
<font color="#616161">Ron, is that your owl?</font>

356
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,170
<font color="#616161">Bloody bird's a menace.</font>

357
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:10,884
<font color="#616161">Oh, no.</font>

358
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:14,513
<font color="#616161">Look, everyone. Weasley's got himself a Howler.</font>

359
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:21,228
<font color="#616161">Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible.</font>

360
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,279
<font color="#616161">Ronald Weasley!</font>

361
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:38,096
<font color="#616161">How dare you steal that car! I am absolutely disgusted!</font>

362
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,874
<font color="#616161">Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work....</font>

363
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,418
<font color="#616161">....nd it's entirely your fault!</font>

364
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:48,755
<font color="#616161">If you put another toe out of line....</font>

365
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:52,176
<font color="#616161">....we'll bring you straight home!</font>

366
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:56,471
<font color="#616161">And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.</font>

367
00:34:56,638 --> 00:35:00,350
<font color="#616161">Your father and I are so proud.</font>

368
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:24,042
<font color="#616161">Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.</font>

369
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,752
<font color="#616161">Me.</font>

370
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,463
<font color="#616161">Gilderoy Lockhart....</font>

371
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,925
<font color="#616161">....Order of Merlin, Third Class....</font>

372
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:36,428
<font color="#616161">....honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League....</font>

373
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,515
<font color="#616161">....and five times winner....</font>

374
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:45,729
<font color="#616161">....of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.</font>

375
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,606
<font color="#616161">But I don't talk about that.</font>

376
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:52,319
<font color="#616161">I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him.</font>

377
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,909
<font color="#616161">Now, be warned.</font>

378
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,245
<font color="#616161">It is my job to arm you....</font>

379
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:06,750
<font color="#616161">....against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind.</font>

380
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:11,171
<font color="#616161">You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.</font>

381
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,384
<font color="#616161">Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.</font>

382
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:18,470
<font color="#616161">I must ask you not to scream.</font>

383
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:21,223
<font color="#616161">It might provoke them.</font>

384
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,228
<font color="#616161">Cornish pixies?</font>

385
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:29,439
<font color="#616161">Freshly caught Cornish pixies.</font>

386
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,359
<font color="#616161">Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan....</font>

387
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:36,697
<font color="#616161">....but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.</font>

388
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,783
<font color="#616161">Let's see what you make of them.</font>

389
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,374
<font color="#616161">Come on now, round them up. They're only pixies.</font>

390
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,269
<font color="#616161">~ You just stay there!
~ Please, get me down!</font>

391
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:12,065
<font color="#616161">~ Get off me!
~ Stop. Hold still!</font>

392
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:16,904
<font color="#616161">Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</font>

393
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:41,178
<font color="#616161">I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.</font>

394
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,098
<font color="#616161">What do we do now?</font>

395
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,060
<font color="#616161">Immobulus!</font>

396
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,822
<font color="#616161">Why is it always me?</font>

397
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,872
<font color="#616161">I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.</font>

398
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,709
<font color="#616161">We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer.</font>

399
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:16,171
<font color="#616161">What....? I don't believe it.</font>

400
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,677
<font color="#616161">~ Where you think you're going, Flint? 
~ Quidditch practice.</font>

401
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:26,223
<font color="#616161">~ I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
~ Easy, Wood. I've got a note.</font>

402
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,852
<font color="#616161">I smell trouble.</font>

403
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,981
<font color="#616161">"I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team....</font>

404
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,651
<font color="#616161">....permission to practice today, owing to the need to 
train their new Seeker."</font>

405
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,487
<font color="#616161">You've got a new Seeker. Who?</font>

406
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,077
<font color="#616161">~ Malfoy?
~ That's right.</font>

407
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:50,038
<font color="#616161">And that's not all that's new this year.</font>

408
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:54,293
<font color="#616161">Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?</font>

409
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,545
<font color="#616161">A gift from Draco's father.</font>

410
00:38:56,712 --> 00:39:00,465
<font color="#616161">You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.</font>

411
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,635
<font color="#616161">At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.</font>

412
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:06,722
<font color="#616161">They got in on pure talent.</font>

413
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:13,812
<font color="#616161">No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.</font>

414
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:19,776
<font color="#616161">You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!</font>

415
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,203
<font color="#616161">You okay, Ron?</font>

416
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,999
<font color="#616161">Say something.</font>

417
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:44,760
<font color="#616161">~ Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
~ No, Colin, get out of the way.</font>

418
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,721
<font color="#616161">Let's take him to Hagrid's.</font>

419
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,015
<font color="#616161">He'll know what to do.</font>

420
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:02,277
<font color="#616161">This calls for a specialist's equipment.</font>

421
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:09,618
<font color="#616161">Nothing to do but wait
till it stops, I'm afraid.</font>

422
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:13,455
<font color="#616161">~ Okay.
~ Better out than in.</font>

423
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:19,378
<font color="#616161">~ Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
~ Malfoy. He called Hermione....</font>

424
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:24,007
<font color="#616161">Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.</font>

425
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,180
<font color="#616161">He called me a Mudblood.</font>

426
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,016
<font color="#616161">~ He did not.
~ What's a Mudblood?</font>

427
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:37,938
<font color="#616161">It means "dirty blood. " Mudblood's a foul name for someone 
who's Muggle-born.</font>

428
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:42,359
<font color="#616161">Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me.</font>

429
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,989
<font color="#616161">It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.</font>

430
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:52,953
<font color="#616161">See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like 
the Malfoy family....</font>

431
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,791
<font color="#616161">....who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood.</font>

432
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,585
<font color="#616161">That's horrible.</font>

433
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:03,922
<font color="#616161">It's disgusting.</font>

434
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:07,593
<font color="#616161">And it's codswallop to boot. Dirty blood.</font>

435
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:11,138
<font color="#616161">Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood 
or less.</font>

436
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:15,851
<font color="#616161">More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do.</font>

437
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:18,228
<font color="#616161">Come here.</font>

438
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:25,019
<font color="#616161">Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute.</font>

439
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,622
<font color="#616161">Harry, Harry, Harry.</font>

440
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,041
<font color="#616161">Can you possibly imagine....</font>

441
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,419
<font color="#616161">....a better way to serve detention....</font>

442
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,756
<font color="#616161">....than by helping me 
to answer my fan mail?</font>

443
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:47,341
<font color="#616161">Not really.</font>

444
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:53,089
<font color="#616161">Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does.</font>

445
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,974
<font color="#616161">Remember that.</font>

446
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,897
<font color="#616161">Come.</font>

447
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,191
<font color="#616161">Come....</font>

448
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,320
<font color="#616161">....to me.</font>

449
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:14,159
<font color="#616161">~ What?
~ Sorry?</font>

450
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,372
<font color="#616161">That voice.</font>

451
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,082
<font color="#616161">Voice?</font>

452
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:28,257
<font color="#616161">~ Didn't you hear it? 
~ What are you talking about, Harry?</font>

453
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,469
<font color="#616161">I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.</font>

454
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:36,723
<font color="#616161">And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours.</font>

455
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:40,394
<font color="#616161">Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.</font>

456
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,901
<font color="#616161">Spooky.</font>

457
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:53,073
<font color="#616161">Blood.</font>

458
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,785
<font color="#616161">I smell blood.</font>

459
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,038
<font color="#616161">Let me rip you.</font>

460
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,792
<font color="#616161">Let me kill you.</font>

461
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:07,087
<font color="#616161">Kill!</font>

462
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,339
<font color="#616161">Kill!</font>

463
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,967
<font color="#616161">~ Kill!
~ Harry!</font>

464
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,636
<font color="#616161">~ Did you hear it?
~ Hear what?</font>

465
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:18,223
<font color="#616161">~ That voice.
~ Voice? What voice?</font>

466
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,352
<font color="#616161">I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just....</font>

467
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,730
<font color="#616161">It's time.</font>

468
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:28,108
<font color="#616161">It's moving. I think
it's going to kill.</font>

469
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:33,030
<font color="#616161">~ Kill?
~ Harry, wait! Not so fast!</font>

470
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:00,682
<font color="#616161">Strange.</font>

471
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:05,687
<font color="#616161">~ I've never seen spiders act like that. 
~ I don't like spiders.</font>

472
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,860
<font color="#616161">What's that?</font>

473
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:19,868
<font color="#616161">"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."</font>

474
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:22,287
<font color="#616161">It's written in blood.</font>

475
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,376
<font color="#616161">Oh, no.</font>

476
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,383
<font color="#616161">It's Filch's cat.</font>

477
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,177
<font color="#616161">It's Mrs. Norris.</font>

478
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:55,946
<font color="#616161">"Enemies of the Heir, beware."</font>

479
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:59,825
<font color="#616161">You'll be next, Mudbloods.</font>

480
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:05,164
<font color="#616161">What's going on here? Go on. Make way, make way.</font>

481
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,458
<font color="#616161">Potter?</font>

482
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,752
<font color="#616161">What are you....?</font>

483
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,383
<font color="#616161">Mrs. Norris?</font>

484
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:22,055
<font color="#616161">~ You've murdered my cat.
~ No. No.</font>

485
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:23,724
<font color="#616161">I'll kill you.</font>

486
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,896
<font color="#616161">~ I'll kill you!
~ Argus!</font>

487
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:32,441
<font color="#616161">Argus, I....</font>

488
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:39,072
<font color="#616161">Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.</font>

489
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,783
<font color="#616161">Everyone except....</font>

490
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,786
<font color="#616161">....you three.</font>

491
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,666
<font color="#616161">Ravenclaws, follow me.</font>

492
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:55,422
<font color="#616161">She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.</font>

493
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,425
<font color="#616161">Thought so. So unlucky
I wasn't there.</font>

494
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:01,803
<font color="#616161">I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.</font>

495
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,767
<font color="#616161">But how she has been
Petrified, I cannot say.</font>

496
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,728
<font color="#616161">Ask him. It's him that's done it.</font>

497
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:12,606
<font color="#616161">You saw what he wrote on the wall.</font>

498
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:16,860
<font color="#616161">It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.</font>

499
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:21,490
<font color="#616161">~ Rubbish.
~ If I might, headmaster?</font>

500
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:26,745
<font color="#616161">Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place 
at the wrong time.</font>

501
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:29,164
<font color="#616161">However....</font>

502
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,459
<font color="#616161">....the circumstances
are suspicious.</font>

503
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:37,256
<font color="#616161">I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.</font>

504
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:39,675
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.</font>

505
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:43,262
<font color="#616161">You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.</font>

506
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:46,723
<font color="#616161">That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor.</font>

507
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,643
<font color="#616161">We'd just found him
when he said....</font>

508
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:55,732
<font color="#616161">~ Yes, Miss Granger?
~ When I said I wasn't hungry.</font>

509
00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:01,113
<font color="#616161">We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.</font>

510
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:08,996
<font color="#616161">~ Innocent until proven guilty, Severus. 
~ My cat has been Petrified.</font>

511
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:15,669
<font color="#616161">~ I want to see some punishment! 
~ We will be able to cure her, Argus.</font>

512
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:21,383
<font color="#616161">As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.</font>

513
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,971
<font color="#616161">When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.</font>

514
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:28,015
<font color="#616161">And in the meantime....</font>

515
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:32,561
<font color="#616161">....I strongly
recommend caution....</font>

516
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,230
<font color="#616161">....to all.</font>

517
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,703
<font color="#616161">~ It's a bit strange, isn't it?
~ Strange?</font>

518
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,623
<font color="#616161">You hear this voice, a
voice only you can hear....</font>

519
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:57,503
<font color="#616161">....and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.</font>

520
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:00,923
<font color="#616161">Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, 
I mean?</font>

521
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,549
<font color="#616161">Are you mad?</font>

522
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:08,222
<font color="#616161">No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't 
a good sign.</font>

523
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,684
<font color="#616161">She's right, you know.</font>

524
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,358
<font color="#616161">Could I have your attention, please?</font>

525
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:25,405
<font color="#616161">Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals....</font>

526
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,950
<font color="#616161">....into water goblets.</font>

527
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,536
<font color="#616161">Like so.</font>

528
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:35,624
<font color="#616161">One, two, three. Vera Verto.</font>

529
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:43,090
<font color="#616161">Now it's your turn. Who
would like to go first?</font>

530
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:48,637
<font color="#616161">Mr. Weasley. "One, two, three. Vera Verto. ".</font>

531
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:54,309
<font color="#616161">Vera Verto!</font>

532
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,110
<font color="#616161">That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.</font>

533
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,613
<font color="#616161">~ Yes, Miss Granger?
~ Professor....</font>

534
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,993
<font color="#616161">....I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

535
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,417
<font color="#616161">Very well.</font>

536
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,920
<font color="#616161">You all know, of course....</font>

537
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:25,966
<font color="#616161">....that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago....</font>

538
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:30,554
<font color="#616161">....by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age</font>

539
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:34,474
<font color="#616161">Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff....</font>

540
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:40,272
<font color="#616161">....Rowena Ravenclaw and
Salazar Slytherin.</font>

541
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:46,245
<font color="#616161">Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.</font>

542
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:50,157
<font color="#616161">~ One did not.
~ Three guesses who.</font>

543
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,327
<font color="#616161">Salazar Slytherin wished
to be more selective....</font>

544
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:56,663
<font color="#616161">....about the students
admitted to Hogwarts.</font>

545
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,418
<font color="#616161">He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.</font>

546
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,712
<font color="#616161">In other words, pure-bloods.</font>

547
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:09,426
<font color="#616161">Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school.</font>

548
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,513
<font color="#616161">Now, according to legend....</font>

549
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:16,391
<font color="#616161">....Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle....</font>

550
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:20,229
<font color="#616161">....known as the
Chamber of Secrets.</font>

551
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:24,817
<font color="#616161">Though, shortly before
departing, he sealed it....</font>

552
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:29,112
<font color="#616161">....until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.</font>

553
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,657
<font color="#616161">The Heir alone....</font>

554
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,493
<font color="#616161">....would be able to open the Chamber....</font>

555
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,414
<font color="#616161">....and unleash the horror within, and by so doing....</font>

556
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:42,960
<font color="#616161">....purge the school
of all those who....</font>

557
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:48,131
<font color="#616161">....in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.</font>

558
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:50,884
<font color="#616161">Muggle-borns.</font>

559
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:55,556
<font color="#616161">Naturally, the school has been searched many times.</font>

560
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:59,184
<font color="#616161">No such chamber has been found.</font>

561
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:04,439
<font color="#616161">Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the 
Chamber?</font>

562
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:07,860
<font color="#616161">The Chamber is said to 
be home to something....</font>

563
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:11,613
<font color="#616161">....that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.</font>

564
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,868
<font color="#616161">It is said to be the home....</font>

565
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,661
<font color="#616161">....of a monster.</font>

566
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:27,087
<font color="#616161">Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?</font>

567
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:31,466
<font color="#616161">Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.</font>

568
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:35,470
<font color="#616161">If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means....</font>

569
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:39,600
<font color="#616161">The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, 
who is it?</font>

570
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:44,146
<font color="#616161">Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?</font>

571
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,982
<font color="#616161">~ If you're talking about Malfoy....
~ Of course. You heard him.</font>

572
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:48,859
<font color="#616161">"You'll be next, Mudbloods."</font>

573
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:51,653
<font color="#616161">I heard him. But Malfoy,
the Heir of Slytherin?</font>

574
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,990
<font color="#616161">Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family.</font>

575
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,951
<font color="#616161">The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.</font>

576
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:01,538
<font color="#616161">Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.</font>

577
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:06,168
<font color="#616161">Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way.</font>

578
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:08,170
<font color="#616161">Mind you, it would be difficult.</font>

579
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:11,381
<font color="#616161">Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules....</font>

580
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:16,011
<font color="#616161">....and it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.</font>

581
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:25,312
<font color="#616161">Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.</font>

582
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:28,190
<font color="#616161">"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker....</font>

583
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:32,611
<font color="#616161">....to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."</font>

584
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:36,573
<font color="#616161">You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe 
and Goyle?</font>

585
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,118
<font color="#616161">~ Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything. 
~ Exactly.</font>

586
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:44,164
<font color="#616161">But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.</font>

587
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:47,417
<font color="#616161">~ How long will it take to make? 
~ A month.</font>

588
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,253
<font color="#616161">A month?</font>

589
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:53,257
<font color="#616161">But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin....</font>

590
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:56,635
<font color="#616161">....he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.</font>

591
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:58,720
<font color="#616161">I know.</font>

592
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,723
<font color="#616161">But it's the only plan we've got.</font>

593
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,109
<font color="#616161">Another goal for Slytherin!</font>

594
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:58,822
<font color="#616161">They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.</font>

595
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,575
<font color="#616161">Yeah!</font>

596
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,619
<font color="#616161">Yeah!</font>

597
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,187
<font color="#616161">All right there, Scarhead?</font>

598
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:38,821
<font color="#616161">Watch yourself, Harry!</font>

599
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,989
<font color="#616161">Wood, look out!</font>

600
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,506
<font color="#616161">Blimey! Harry's got 
himself a rogue Bludger.</font>

601
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,424
<font color="#616161">That's been tampered
with, that has.</font>

602
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:01,510
<font color="#616161">I'll stop it.</font>

603
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:06,265
<font color="#616161">No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry.</font>

604
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,917
<font color="#616161">Training for the ballet, Potter?</font>

605
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:07,117
<font color="#616161">You'll never catch me, Potter.</font>

606
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,001
<font color="#616161">Let's go.</font>

607
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:44,381
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter has caught the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!</font>

608
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,723
<font color="#616161">Finite Incantatem!</font>

609
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:01,148
<font color="#616161">~ Thank you.
~ Are you okay?</font>

610
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,400
<font color="#616161">No. I think my arm is broken.</font>

611
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:07,362
<font color="#616161">Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straightaway.</font>

612
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:10,491
<font color="#616161">~ Not you. 
~ Boy doesn't know what he's saying.</font>

613
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:14,203
<font color="#616161">This won't hurt a bit.</font>

614
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,295
<font color="#616161">Brackium Emendo!</font>

615
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:34,431
<font color="#616161">Yes, well, that can sometimes happen....</font>

616
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,850
<font color="#616161">....but the point is....</font>

617
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:42,356
<font color="#616161">....you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, 
the bones are not broken.</font>

618
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:45,192
<font color="#616161">Broken? There's no bones left.</font>

619
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,862
<font color="#616161">Much more flexible, though.</font>

620
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:55,244
<font color="#616161">Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss. You can go. Out of my way.</font>

621
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,371
<font color="#616161">Should have been brought
straight to me.</font>

622
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:00,082
<font color="#616161">I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back....</font>

623
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:01,750
<font color="#616161">You will be able to, won't you?</font>

624
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:05,045
<font color="#616161">I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful.</font>

625
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:10,342
<font color="#616161">You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business.</font>

626
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,265
<font color="#616161">What do you expect? Pumpkin juice?</font>

627
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,648
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

628
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:27,025
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

629
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:35,617
<font color="#616161">Time to kill.</font>

630
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:42,791
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

631
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:45,627
<font color="#616161">Dobby?</font>

632
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,130
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter should
have listened to Dobby.</font>

633
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:52,301
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.</font>

634
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:57,097
<font color="#616161">It was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.</font>

635
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:00,350
<font color="#616161">Indeed. Yes, sir.</font>

636
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:06,398
<font color="#616161">~ You nearly got Ron and me expelled. 
~ At least you would be away from here.</font>

637
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:09,234
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must go home.</font>

638
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:12,988
<font color="#616161">Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make 
Harry Potter see....</font>

639
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:16,533
<font color="#616161">Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?</font>

640
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,287
<font color="#616161">Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.</font>

641
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:24,082
<font color="#616161">Dobby had to iron his hands.</font>

642
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:30,881
<font color="#616161">You better clear off before my bones come back, or I might 
strangle you.</font>

643
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,511
<font color="#616161">Dobby is used to
death threats, sir.</font>

644
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,722
<font color="#616161">Dobby gets them five
times a day at home.</font>

645
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,683
<font color="#616161">I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?</font>

646
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:45,854
<font color="#616161">Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.</font>

647
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:49,358
<font color="#616161">Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed....</font>

648
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:52,653
<font color="#616161">....over
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</font>

649
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,532
<font color="#616161">We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.</font>

650
01:00:56,698 --> 01:01:02,120
<font color="#616161">Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin.</font>

651
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:14,091
<font color="#616161">Why do you wear
that thing, Dobby?</font>

652
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:19,388
<font color="#616161">This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement.</font>

653
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:24,685
<font color="#616161">Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.</font>

654
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:28,188
<font color="#616161">Listen.</font>

655
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:29,898
<font color="#616161">Listen!</font>

656
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:33,777
<font color="#616161">Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.</font>

657
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:36,864
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must not stay here....</font>

658
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,577
<font color="#616161">....now that history is to repeat itself.</font>

659
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:45,205
<font color="#616161">Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?</font>

660
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,374
<font color="#616161">I shouldn't have said that.</font>

661
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:54,256
<font color="#616161">~ Bad Dobby! Bad!
~ Stop it!</font>

662
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:56,091
<font color="#616161">Stop it, Dobby!</font>

663
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:01,597
<font color="#616161">Tell me. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?</font>

664
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:06,977
<font color="#616161">Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.</font>

665
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:10,063
<font color="#616161">No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?</font>

666
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:22,993
<font color="#616161">Put him here.</font>

667
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:30,501
<font color="#616161">~ What happened?
~ There's been another attack.</font>

668
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:36,465
<font color="#616161">I think he's been
Petrified, Madam Pomfrey.</font>

669
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:41,970
<font color="#616161">Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.</font>

670
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:52,815
<font color="#616161">What can this mean, Albus?</font>

671
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:54,942
<font color="#616161">It means....</font>

672
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:58,070
<font color="#616161">....that our students
are in great danger.</font>

673
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:01,657
<font color="#616161">~ What should I tell the staff?
~ The truth.</font>

674
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:05,702
<font color="#616161">Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.</font>

675
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:08,997
<font color="#616161">It is as we feared, Minerva.</font>

676
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:13,794
<font color="#616161">The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.</font>

677
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:20,759
<font color="#616161">Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?</font>

678
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:23,679
<font color="#616161">Of course. Don't you see?</font>

679
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:26,849
<font color="#616161">Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.</font>

680
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:30,060
<font color="#616161">~ Now he's taught Draco how to do it. 
~ Maybe.</font>

681
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:33,397
<font color="#616161">We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.</font>

682
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:37,526
<font color="#616161">Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight....</font>

683
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:41,655
<font color="#616161">....in the middle of the girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?</font>

684
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:45,200
<font color="#616161">No. No one ever comes in here.</font>

685
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:48,579
<font color="#616161">~ Why?
~ Moaning Myrtle.</font>

686
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,706
<font color="#616161">Who?</font>

687
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:52,875
<font color="#616161">Moaning Myrtle.</font>

688
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:56,503
<font color="#616161">~ Who's Moaning Myrtle?
~ I'm Moaning Myrtle.</font>

689
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:04,803
<font color="#616161">I wouldn't expect you to know me.</font>

690
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,015
<font color="#616161">Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable....</font>

691
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:11,560
<font color="#616161">....moping Moaning Myrtle?</font>

692
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:20,903
<font color="#616161">She's a little sensitive.</font>

693
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,367
<font color="#616161">Gather round!</font>

694
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:32,706
<font color="#616161">Gather round. Can
everybody see me?</font>

695
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:36,001
<font color="#616161">Can you all hear me?</font>

696
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,003
<font color="#616161">Excellent.</font>

697
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:42,216
<font color="#616161">In light of the dark
events of recent weeks....</font>

698
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:47,054
<font color="#616161">....Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club....</font>

699
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:51,892
<font color="#616161">....to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves....</font>

700
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,686
<font color="#616161">....as I myself have done on countless occasions.</font>

701
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:58,565
<font color="#616161">For full details, see my published works.</font>

702
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,406
<font color="#616161">Let me introduce my assistant....</font>

703
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:09,201
<font color="#616161">....Professor Snape.</font>

704
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:15,332
<font color="#616161">He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.</font>

705
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:17,543
<font color="#616161">I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.</font>

706
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:22,631
<font color="#616161">You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.</font>

707
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,898
<font color="#616161">One.</font>

708
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:41,108
<font color="#616161">Two.</font>

709
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,945
<font color="#616161">~ Three!
~ Expelliarmus!</font>

710
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:56,206
<font color="#616161">~ Do you think he's all right?
~ Who cares?</font>

711
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:59,334
<font color="#616161">An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape....</font>

712
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:04,047
<font color="#616161">....but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you 
were about to do.</font>

713
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:07,467
<font color="#616161">If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.</font>

714
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:11,096
<font color="#616161">Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students....</font>

715
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:15,767
<font color="#616161">....to block unfriendly
spells, Professor.</font>

716
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,938
<font color="#616161">An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.</font>

717
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:25,444
<font color="#616161">Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you?</font>

718
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:29,114
<font color="#616161">Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.</font>

719
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:33,243
<font color="#616161">We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.</font>

720
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:37,498
<font color="#616161">Might I suggest someone
from my own house?</font>

721
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:41,251
<font color="#616161">Malfoy, perhaps?</font>

722
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:51,261
<font color="#616161">~ Good luck, Potter.
~ Thank you, sir.</font>

723
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,230
<font color="#616161">Wands at the ready.</font>

724
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:04,817
<font color="#616161">~ Scared, Potter?
~ You wish.</font>

725
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:16,954
<font color="#616161">On the count of three....</font>

726
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:21,458
<font color="#616161">....cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.</font>

727
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:25,170
<font color="#616161">We don't want any accidents here. One.</font>

728
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:29,508
<font color="#616161">~ Two.
~ Everte Statum!</font>

729
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:43,397
<font color="#616161">Rictusempra!</font>

730
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:56,160
<font color="#616161">I said disarm only.</font>

731
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:58,328
<font color="#616161">Serpensortia!</font>

732
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:09,798
<font color="#616161">Don't move, Potter. I'll
get rid of it for you.</font>

733
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:15,387
<font color="#616161">Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte Ascendare!</font>

734
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,599
<font color="#616161">Vipera Evanesca.</font>

735
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:09,691
<font color="#616161">What are you playing at?</font>

736
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:25,165
<font color="#616161">You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?</font>

737
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,584
<font color="#616161">~ I'm a what?
~ You can talk to snakes.</font>

738
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:33,090
<font color="#616161">I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at 
the zoo once.</font>

739
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:37,219
<font color="#616161">Once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.</font>

740
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:41,140
<font color="#616161">No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry.</font>

741
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,350
<font color="#616161">This is bad.</font>

742
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:47,271
<font color="#616161">What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin....</font>

743
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:50,899
<font color="#616161">~ That's what you said to it.
~ You were there. You heard me.</font>

744
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:54,945
<font color="#616161">I heard you speaking
Parseltongue. Snake language.</font>

745
01:09:55,112 --> 01:09:57,990
<font color="#616161">I spoke a different language?</font>

746
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:01,451
<font color="#616161">But I didn't realize....</font>

747
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:04,413
<font color="#616161">How can I speak a language without knowing I can?</font>

748
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:08,584
<font color="#616161">I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake 
on or something.</font>

749
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,460
<font color="#616161">Harry, listen to me.</font>

750
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,755
<font color="#616161">There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.</font>

751
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:18,427
<font color="#616161">Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.</font>

752
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:19,720
<font color="#616161">Exactly.</font>

753
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:23,265
<font color="#616161">Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.</font>

754
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:25,434
<font color="#616161">But I'm not.</font>

755
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:30,105
<font color="#616161">I can't be.</font>

756
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,275
<font color="#616161">He lived a thousand years ago.</font>

757
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:36,653
<font color="#616161">For all we know, you could be.</font>

758
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:09,144
<font color="#616161">I'll see you back in the common room.</font>

759
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:29,832
<font color="#616161">I want blood.</font>

760
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:37,714
<font color="#616161">They all must die.</font>

761
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:40,300
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

762
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:43,053
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

763
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:46,140
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

764
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:50,519
<font color="#616161">Time to kill.</font>

765
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,638
<font color="#616161">Caught in the act.</font>

766
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,765
<font color="#616161">I'll have you out this time, Potter.</font>

767
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:31,768
<font color="#616161">Mark my words.</font>

768
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:36,190
<font color="#616161">No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand....</font>

769
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:04,885
<font color="#616161">Professor....</font>

770
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,428
<font color="#616161">....I swear I didn't.</font>

771
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:09,848
<font color="#616161">This is out of my hands, Potter.</font>

772
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:22,152
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.</font>

773
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:33,664
<font color="#616161">Sherbet Lemon.</font>

774
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:09,741
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore?</font>

775
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:28,927
<font color="#616161">Bee in your bonnet, Potter?</font>

776
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:36,351
<font color="#616161">I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.</font>

777
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:41,982
<font color="#616161">Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.</font>

778
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:45,694
<font color="#616161">But I stand by what I said last year.</font>

779
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,239
<font color="#616161">You would have done well in Slytherin.</font>

780
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:50,741
<font color="#616161">You're wrong.</font>

781
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,438
<font color="#616161">Harry?</font>

782
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:24,066
<font color="#616161">Professor.</font>

783
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:28,028
<font color="#616161">Your bird.... There was 
nothing I could do.</font>

784
01:15:28,612 --> 01:15:31,949
<font color="#616161">~ He just caught fire.
~ And about time too.</font>

785
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:35,118
<font color="#616161">He's been looking
dreadful for days.</font>

786
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,287
<font color="#616161">Pity you had to see him on a burning day.</font>

787
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:42,459
<font color="#616161">Fawkes is a Phoenix, Harry.</font>

788
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:45,963
<font color="#616161">They burst into flame when it is time for them to die....</font>

789
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:48,257
<font color="#616161">....and then they are....</font>

790
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:51,468
<font color="#616161">....reborn from the ashes.</font>

791
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:02,479
<font color="#616161">Fascinating
creatures, phoenixes.</font>

792
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:06,817
<font color="#616161">They can carry
immensely heavy loads.</font>

793
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:09,820
<font color="#616161">Their tears have healing powers.</font>

794
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:15,492
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen!</font>

795
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:18,620
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore,
sir, it wasn't Harry.</font>

796
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:22,666
<font color="#616161">I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.</font>

797
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:26,003
<font color="#616161">Relax.</font>

798
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:28,714
<font color="#616161">I do not believe....</font>

799
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:32,384
<font color="#616161">....that Harry attacked anyone.
~ Of course you don't.</font>

800
01:16:36,138 --> 01:16:38,724
<font color="#616161">Right. Well, I'll....</font>

801
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:42,019
<font color="#616161">~ I'll just wait outside, then.
~ Yes.</font>

802
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:49,359
<font color="#616161">~ You don't think it was me, Professor? 
~ No, Harry.</font>

803
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:52,029
<font color="#616161">I do not think it was you.</font>

804
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:54,865
<font color="#616161">But I must ask you....</font>

805
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:59,536
<font color="#616161">....is there something 
you wish to tell me?</font>

806
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,920
<font color="#616161">No, sir.</font>

807
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:09,588
<font color="#616161">Nothing.</font>

808
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:14,760
<font color="#616161">Very well, then.</font>

809
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:16,720
<font color="#616161">Off you go.</font>

810
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:58,220
<font color="#616161">Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.</font>

811
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:00,097
<font color="#616161">Crabbe and Goyle.</font>

812
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:03,058
<font color="#616161">We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle....</font>

813
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:06,436
<font color="#616161">....can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.</font>

814
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:09,481
<font color="#616161">~ How?
~ I've got it all worked out.</font>

815
01:18:09,648 --> 01:18:12,234
<font color="#616161">I filled these with a
simple Sleeping Draught.</font>

816
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:15,154
<font color="#616161">Simple, but powerful.</font>

817
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,531
<font color="#616161">Now, once they're asleep....</font>

818
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:20,909
<font color="#616161">....hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs....</font>

819
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:22,953
<font color="#616161">....and put on their uniforms.</font>

820
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,415
<font color="#616161">~ Whose hair are you ripping out, then? 
~ I've already got mine.</font>

821
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:29,751
<font color="#616161">Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.</font>

822
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:32,087
<font color="#616161">I got this off her robes.</font>

823
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,882
<font color="#616161">I'm going to go check on
the Polyjuice Potion.</font>

824
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:37,759
<font color="#616161">Make sure that Crabbe 
and Goyle find these.</font>

825
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:52,274
<font color="#616161">Ron, maybe I should do it.</font>

826
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:54,485
<font color="#616161">Yeah. Right.</font>

827
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:58,530
<font color="#616161">Wingardium Leviosa.</font>

828
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,292
<font color="#616161">Cool.</font>

829
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,275
<font color="#616161">How thick could you get?</font>

830
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,402
<font color="#616161">Come on, let's get them.</font>

831
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:44,076
<font color="#616161">We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.</font>

832
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:54,211
<font color="#616161">Add the hairs.</font>

833
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:00,509
<font color="#616161">Essence of Crabbe.</font>

834
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,553
<font color="#616161">Cheers.</font>

835
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,689
<font color="#616161">I think I'm gonna be sick.</font>

836
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:18,443
<font color="#616161">Me too.</font>

837
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:05,073
<font color="#616161">Harry?</font>

838
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:07,075
<font color="#616161">Ron.</font>

839
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,995
<font color="#616161">Bloody hell!</font>

840
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:13,081
<font color="#616161">We still sound like ourselves.</font>

841
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:15,000
<font color="#616161">You need to sound more like Crabbe.</font>

842
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:18,462
<font color="#616161">~ Bloody hell.
~ Excellent.</font>

843
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:21,298
<font color="#616161">~ But where's Hermione?
~ I....</font>

844
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:24,468
<font color="#616161">I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.</font>

845
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:26,345
<font color="#616161">Hermione, are you okay?</font>

846
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:29,348
<font color="#616161">Just go. You're wasting time.</font>

847
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:33,101
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

848
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:39,942
<font color="#616161">I think the Slytherin
common room's this way.</font>

849
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:45,405
<font color="#616161">Excuse me.</font>

850
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,117
<font color="#616161">What are you doing d....?</font>

851
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,370
<font color="#616161">I mean, what are you
doing down here?</font>

852
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,999
<font color="#616161">I happen to be a school prefect.</font>

853
01:21:56,166 --> 01:22:00,629
<font color="#616161">You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors 
at night.</font>

854
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:03,048
<font color="#616161">What are your names again?</font>

855
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:07,219
<font color="#616161">~ I'm.... 
~ Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?</font>

856
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:10,430
<font color="#616161">Pigging out in the Great
Hall all this time?</font>

857
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:14,226
<font color="#616161">Why are you wearing glasses?</font>

858
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,896
<font color="#616161">~ Reading.
~ Reading?</font>

859
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:21,358
<font color="#616161">I didn't know you could read.</font>

860
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:26,321
<font color="#616161">And what are you doing
down here, Weasley?</font>

861
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,532
<font color="#616161">Mind your attitude, Malfoy.</font>

862
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:39,334
<font color="#616161">Well, sit down.</font>

863
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:45,966
<font color="#616161">You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.</font>

864
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:50,012
<font color="#616161">They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.</font>

865
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:53,140
<font color="#616161">What's wrong with you, Crabbe?</font>

866
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,102
<font color="#616161">Stomachache.</font>

867
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:03,942
<font color="#616161">I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.</font>

868
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:06,570
<font color="#616161">I suppose Dumbledore is
trying to hush it all up.</font>

869
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:09,239
<font color="#616161">Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing....</font>

870
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:13,202
<font color="#616161">....that ever happened to this place.
~ You're wrong!</font>

871
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,877
<font color="#616161">What?</font>

872
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:25,714
<font color="#616161">You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?</font>

873
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:28,300
<font color="#616161">Well? Do you?</font>

874
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,719
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter?</font>

875
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:38,685
<font color="#616161">Good one, Goyle.</font>

876
01:23:38,852 --> 01:23:40,395
<font color="#616161">You're absolutely right.</font>

877
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:42,898
<font color="#616161">Saint Potter.</font>

878
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:46,693
<font color="#616161">And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?</font>

879
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,075
<font color="#616161">But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.</font>

880
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:56,912
<font color="#616161">You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.</font>

881
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:00,415
<font color="#616161">How many times do I
have to tell you?</font>

882
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,252
<font color="#616161">Is this yours?</font>

883
01:24:07,714 --> 01:24:10,092
<font color="#616161">But my father did say this.</font>

884
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,387
<font color="#616161">It's been 50 years since
the Chamber was opened.</font>

885
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:17,933
<font color="#616161">He wouldn't tell me who opened it. Only that they were expelled.</font>

886
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:22,896
<font color="#616161">The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.</font>

887
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:27,359
<font color="#616161">So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.</font>

888
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:29,778
<font color="#616161">As for me....</font>

889
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,114
<font color="#616161">....I hope it's Granger.</font>

890
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:34,491
<font color="#616161">What's the matter with you two?</font>

891
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:37,161
<font color="#616161">You're acting very odd.</font>

892
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:39,538
<font color="#616161">It's his stomachache.</font>

893
01:24:39,705 --> 01:24:41,790
<font color="#616161">Calm down.</font>

894
01:24:45,961 --> 01:24:47,963
<font color="#616161">Scar.</font>

895
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,968
<font color="#616161">Hair.</font>

896
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:01,518
<font color="#616161">Hey! Where are you going?</font>

897
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:05,814
<font color="#616161">That was close.</font>

898
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,400
<font color="#616161">Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you.</font>

899
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:10,444
<font color="#616161">Go away.</font>

900
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:14,823
<font color="#616161">Wait till you see. It's awful.</font>

901
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:18,535
<font color="#616161">Hermione?</font>

902
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:20,329
<font color="#616161">Are you okay?</font>

903
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:24,166
<font color="#616161">Do you remember me telling you....</font>

904
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:27,503
<font color="#616161">....that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?</font>

905
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:31,799
<font color="#616161">It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.</font>

906
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:35,719
<font color="#616161">Look at my face.</font>

907
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:39,306
<font color="#616161">Look at your tail.</font>

908
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:47,314
<font color="#616161">Have you spoken to Hermione?</font>

909
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:50,025
<font color="#616161">She should be out of
hospital in a few days....</font>

910
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:53,028
<font color="#616161">....when she stops
coughing up fur balls.</font>

911
01:25:57,783 --> 01:25:59,535
<font color="#616161">What's this?</font>

912
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:05,207
<font color="#616161">Yuck!</font>

913
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:08,168
<font color="#616161">Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.</font>

914
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:28,522
<font color="#616161">~ Come to throw something else at me?
~ Why would I throw something at you?</font>

915
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:33,026
<font color="#616161">Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business....</font>

916
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:36,822
<font color="#616161">....and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.</font>

917
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,908
<font color="#616161">But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.</font>

918
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:42,494
<font color="#616161">I mean, it'll just go
right through you.</font>

919
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:47,916
<font color="#616161">Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.</font>

920
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,711
<font color="#616161">Ten points if you get
it through her stomach!</font>

921
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:54,381
<font color="#616161">Fifty points if it 
goes through her head!</font>

922
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:59,303
<font color="#616161">~ But who threw it at you, anyway?
~ I don't know. I didn't see them.</font>

923
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:03,891
<font color="#616161">I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death....</font>

924
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:07,769
<font color="#616161">....and it fell through
the top of my head.</font>

925
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:40,427
<font color="#616161">"Tom Marvolo Riddle."</font>

926
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,626
<font color="#616161">My name....</font>

927
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:15,712
<font color="#616161">....is Harry....</font>

928
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:19,466
<font color="#616161">....Potter.</font>

929
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:37,860
<font color="#616161">Do you know anything....</font>

930
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:44,367
<font color="#616161">....about the Chamber of Secrets?</font>

931
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:57,421
<font color="#616161">Can you....</font>

932
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:00,966
<font color="#616161">....tell me?</font>

933
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:06,657
<font color="#616161">Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here?</font>

934
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:12,454
<font color="#616161">Are you Tom Riddle?</font>

935
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:14,414
<font color="#616161">Hello, can you hear me?</font>

936
01:30:34,977 --> 01:30:36,728
<font color="#616161">Riddle!</font>

937
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:38,856
<font color="#616161">Come.</font>

938
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:41,024
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore.</font>

939
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,362
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore?</font>

940
01:30:46,655 --> 01:30:50,159
<font color="#616161">It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.</font>

941
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:53,662
<font color="#616161">Yes, Professor. I suppose I....</font>

942
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:55,998
<font color="#616161">I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.</font>

943
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:59,501
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true.</font>

944
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:02,504
<font color="#616161">About the school as well? I don't have a home to go to.</font>

945
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:05,507
<font color="#616161">They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?</font>

946
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:08,218
<font color="#616161">I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid....</font>

947
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:11,930
<font color="#616161">....Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.</font>

948
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:16,602
<font color="#616161">Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught....</font>

949
01:31:18,854 --> 01:31:20,981
<font color="#616161">Is there something....</font>

950
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:23,901
<font color="#616161">....you wish to tell me?</font>

951
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,654
<font color="#616161">No, sir. Nothing.</font>

952
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:37,456
<font color="#616161">Very well, then. Off you go.</font>

953
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:39,500
<font color="#616161">Good night, sir.</font>

954
01:32:15,619 --> 01:32:18,539
<font color="#616161">~ Let's get you out of there.
~ Evening, Hagrid.</font>

955
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:23,210
<font color="#616161">I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't think you meant 
it to kill anyone....</font>

956
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:25,671
<font color="#616161">You can't. You don't understand.</font>

957
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:29,007
<font color="#616161">The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts 
can do....</font>

958
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:32,094
<font color="#616161">....is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.</font>

959
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,472
<font color="#616161">It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one. Never.</font>

960
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:37,975
<font color="#616161">Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.</font>

961
01:32:38,142 --> 01:32:39,768
<font color="#616161">~ Now, stand aside.
~ No!</font>

962
01:32:39,935 --> 01:32:41,895
<font color="#616161">~ Stand aside, Hagrid.
~ No!</font>

963
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,689
<font color="#616161">Cistem Aperio!</font>

964
01:32:50,654 --> 01:32:52,990
<font color="#616161">Arania Exumai!</font>

965
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:55,325
<font color="#616161">Aragog!</font>

966
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:56,743
<font color="#616161">Aragog!</font>

967
01:32:57,286 --> 01:32:58,662
<font color="#616161">I can't let you go.</font>

968
01:32:59,204 --> 01:33:02,499
<font color="#616161">They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled.</font>

969
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:06,920
<font color="#616161">Hagrid!</font>

970
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:41,079
<font color="#616161">It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.</font>

971
01:33:41,246 --> 01:33:44,208
<font color="#616161">It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.</font>

972
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:48,462
<font color="#616161">We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.</font>

973
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:52,132
<font color="#616161">The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?</font>

974
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:56,386
<font color="#616161">Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask 
him about it?</font>

975
01:33:56,595 --> 01:33:59,264
<font color="#616161">That would be a cheerful visit. "Hello, Hagrid.</font>

976
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:03,268
<font color="#616161">Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"</font>

977
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:06,647
<font color="#616161">Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, 
would you?</font>

978
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:07,981
<font color="#616161">No.</font>

979
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:14,112
<font color="#616161">What's that you've got, Hagrid?</font>

980
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:19,117
<font color="#616161">It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know.</font>

981
01:34:19,284 --> 01:34:22,955
<font color="#616161">Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got 
a bit of growing to do.</font>

982
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:26,625
<font color="#616161">But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them....</font>

983
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:30,087
<font color="#616161">....and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified.</font>

984
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:34,424
<font color="#616161">In the meantime, though, you three....</font>

985
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:37,761
<font color="#616161">....had best be looking after yourselves. All right?</font>

986
01:34:45,644 --> 01:34:47,563
<font color="#616161">Hello, Neville.</font>

987
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:51,150
<font color="#616161">Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come.</font>

988
01:34:51,525 --> 01:34:53,235
<font color="#616161">Come on!</font>

989
01:35:15,799 --> 01:35:19,803
<font color="#616161">It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password.</font>

990
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:22,222
<font color="#616161">Unless it wasn't a student.</font>

991
01:35:22,389 --> 01:35:25,809
<font color="#616161">Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.</font>

992
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:27,394
<font color="#616161">And they found it.</font>

993
01:35:28,145 --> 01:35:30,647
<font color="#616161">Tom Riddle's diary is gone.</font>

994
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:33,525
<font color="#616161">All right, listen up.</font>

995
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:36,612
<font color="#616161">We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.</font>

996
01:35:36,778 --> 01:35:38,655
<font color="#616161">We're stronger, quicker and smarter.</font>

997
01:35:38,822 --> 01:35:41,825
<font color="#616161">Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them....</font>

998
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:45,496
<font color="#616161">....if they fly anywhere near him. 
~ Well, that too.</font>

999
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:48,248
<font color="#616161">Professor McGonagall.</font>

1000
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:51,460
<font color="#616161">~ This match has been canceled.
~ We can't cancel Quidditch.</font>

1001
01:35:51,627 --> 01:35:56,590
<font color="#616161">Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.</font>

1002
01:35:56,757 --> 01:35:59,426
<font color="#616161">Potter, you and I will
find Mr. Weasley.</font>

1003
01:35:59,802 --> 01:36:02,346
<font color="#616161">There's something the
both of you have to see.</font>

1004
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:08,018
<font color="#616161">I warn you. This could
be a wee bit of a shock.</font>

1005
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:17,611
<font color="#616161">Hermione!</font>

1006
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:19,571
<font color="#616161">She was found near the library....</font>

1007
01:36:20,823 --> 01:36:22,866
<font color="#616161">....along with this.</font>

1008
01:36:24,326 --> 01:36:27,162
<font color="#616161">Does it mean anything to either of you?</font>

1009
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:28,789
<font color="#616161">No.</font>

1010
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:45,347
<font color="#616161">Could I have your attention, please?</font>

1011
01:36:45,514 --> 01:36:51,145
<font color="#616161">Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately.</font>

1012
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:56,608
<font color="#616161">"All students will return to their house common rooms by 
6:00 every evening."</font>

1013
01:36:56,775 --> 01:37:00,863
<font color="#616161">All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.</font>

1014
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:04,032
<font color="#616161">"No exceptions."</font>

1015
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,743
<font color="#616161">I should tell you this.</font>

1016
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:11,039
<font color="#616161">Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught....</font>

1017
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:14,751
<font color="#616161">....it is likely the
school will be closed.</font>

1018
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:29,224
<font color="#616161">We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him....</font>

1019
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:31,685
<font color="#616161">....but if he did set the monster loose last time....</font>

1020
01:37:31,852 --> 01:37:35,022
<font color="#616161">....he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. 
That's a start.</font>

1021
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:36,440
<font color="#616161">But you heard McGonagall.</font>

1022
01:37:36,607 --> 01:37:39,902
<font color="#616161">We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.</font>

1023
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,821
<font color="#616161">I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.</font>

1024
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:58,170
<font color="#616161">Who's there?</font>

1025
01:38:01,965 --> 01:38:03,550
<font color="#616161">Hello?</font>

1026
01:38:04,176 --> 01:38:05,719
<font color="#616161">Hello?</font>

1027
01:38:06,887 --> 01:38:11,183
<font color="#616161">~ What's that for?
~ Nothing. I was expecting....</font>

1028
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:15,229
<font color="#616161">It doesn't matter. Come on in. I just made a pot of tea.</font>

1029
01:38:17,981 --> 01:38:20,275
<font color="#616161">Hagrid, are you okay?</font>

1030
01:38:20,442 --> 01:38:23,320
<font color="#616161">I'm fine. I'm all right.</font>

1031
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:25,989
<font color="#616161">Did you hear about Hermione?</font>

1032
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:30,160
<font color="#616161">Yeah. I heard about that, all right.</font>

1033
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:34,164
<font color="#616161">Look, we have to ask you something.</font>

1034
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:39,336
<font color="#616161">Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?</font>

1035
01:38:41,672 --> 01:38:43,966
<font color="#616161">What you had to understand about that is....</font>

1036
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:47,219
<font color="#616161">Quick, under the cloak.</font>

1037
01:38:47,886 --> 01:38:50,973
<font color="#616161">Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you.</font>

1038
01:38:57,396 --> 01:39:00,482
<font color="#616161">~ Professor Dumbledore, sir.
~ Good evening, Hagrid.</font>

1039
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:03,068
<font color="#616161">I wonder, could we....?</font>

1040
01:39:03,235 --> 01:39:05,737
<font color="#616161">Of course. Come in. Come in.</font>

1041
01:39:05,904 --> 01:39:07,281
<font color="#616161">That's Dad's boss.</font>

1042
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:11,034
<font color="#616161">Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.</font>

1043
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:15,581
<font color="#616161">Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business. Had to come.</font>

1044
01:39:15,747 --> 01:39:19,001
<font color="#616161">Three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough.</font>

1045
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:22,379
<font color="#616161">~ The Ministry's got to act.
~ But I never....</font>

1046
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:24,381
<font color="#616161">You know I never, Professor.</font>

1047
01:39:24,548 --> 01:39:27,634
<font color="#616161">I want it understood, Cornelius....</font>

1048
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:29,636
<font color="#616161">....that Hagrid....</font>

1049
01:39:29,803 --> 01:39:32,097
<font color="#616161">....has my full confidence.</font>

1050
01:39:32,264 --> 01:39:36,059
<font color="#616161">Albus, look, Hagrid's
record is against him.</font>

1051
01:39:36,226 --> 01:39:38,770
<font color="#616161">~ I've got to take him.
~ Take me?</font>

1052
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:41,231
<font color="#616161">Take me where? Not
Azkaban prison.</font>

1053
01:39:41,523 --> 01:39:45,277
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid we have
no choice, Hagrid.</font>

1054
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:47,821
<font color="#616161">Already here, Fudge?</font>

1055
01:39:47,988 --> 01:39:49,323
<font color="#616161">Good.</font>

1056
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,993
<font color="#616161">What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!</font>

1057
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,204
<font color="#616161">Believe me....</font>

1058
01:39:55,496 --> 01:39:59,708
<font color="#616161">....I take absolutely no
pleasure being inside your....</font>

1059
01:40:01,585 --> 01:40:03,796
<font color="#616161">You call this a house?</font>

1060
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:05,923
<font color="#616161">No.</font>

1061
01:40:06,089 --> 01:40:09,968
<font color="#616161">I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.</font>

1062
01:40:10,135 --> 01:40:14,223
<font color="#616161">Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?</font>

1063
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:19,520
<font color="#616161">The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.</font>

1064
01:40:21,146 --> 01:40:24,066
<font color="#616161">This is an order of suspension.</font>

1065
01:40:29,613 --> 01:40:32,991
<font color="#616161">You'll find all 12 signatures on it.</font>

1066
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:41,083
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.</font>

1067
01:40:41,792 --> 01:40:44,128
<font color="#616161">Well, what, with all these attacks....</font>

1068
01:40:44,294 --> 01:40:47,089
<font color="#616161">....there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.</font>

1069
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:51,802
<font color="#616161">I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.</font>

1070
01:40:51,969 --> 01:40:54,179
<font color="#616161">You can't take Professor
Dumbledore away.</font>

1071
01:40:54,471 --> 01:40:57,015
<font color="#616161">Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.</font>

1072
01:40:57,182 --> 01:40:59,643
<font color="#616161">You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!</font>

1073
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:01,478
<font color="#616161">You think so?</font>

1074
01:41:01,645 --> 01:41:04,148
<font color="#616161">Calm yourself, Hagrid.</font>

1075
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:08,235
<font color="#616161">If the governors desire my removal....</font>

1076
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:12,114
<font color="#616161">....I will, of course, step aside.</font>

1077
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:15,951
<font color="#616161">However....</font>

1078
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:21,165
<font color="#616161">....you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts....</font>

1079
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:23,208
<font color="#616161">....to those who....</font>

1080
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:25,711
<font color="#616161">....ask for it.</font>

1081
01:41:32,509 --> 01:41:34,845
<font color="#616161">Admirable sentiments.</font>

1082
01:41:35,012 --> 01:41:36,847
<font color="#616161">Shall we?</font>

1083
01:41:48,942 --> 01:41:50,486
<font color="#616161">Fudge.</font>

1084
01:41:52,196 --> 01:41:54,031
<font color="#616161">Come, Hagrid.</font>

1085
01:41:55,157 --> 01:41:56,700
<font color="#616161">Well?</font>

1086
01:41:57,367 --> 01:41:58,452
<font color="#616161">If....</font>

1087
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:01,413
<font color="#616161">If anybody was looking
for some stuff....</font>

1088
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:06,460
<font color="#616161">....then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.</font>

1089
01:42:06,627 --> 01:42:09,213
<font color="#616161">Yep. That would lead them right.</font>

1090
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:11,340
<font color="#616161">That's all I have to say.</font>

1091
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:16,804
<font color="#616161">And someone will need to
feed Fang while I'm away.</font>

1092
01:42:20,182 --> 01:42:22,184
<font color="#616161">Good boy.</font>

1093
01:42:28,315 --> 01:42:30,442
<font color="#616161">Hagrid's right.</font>

1094
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:33,570
<font color="#616161">With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.</font>

1095
01:42:33,737 --> 01:42:35,405
<font color="#616161">Look.</font>

1096
01:42:41,453 --> 01:42:43,247
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1097
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:49,002
<font color="#616161">Come on, Fang.</font>

1098
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:08,647
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1099
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:10,107
<font color="#616161">What?</font>

1100
01:43:10,274 --> 01:43:13,527
<font color="#616161">You heard what Hagrid said. "Follow the spiders."</font>

1101
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:16,363
<font color="#616161">They're heading to
the Dark Forest.</font>

1102
01:43:18,407 --> 01:43:22,870
<font color="#616161">Why spiders? Why couldn't it be "follow the butterflies"?</font>

1103
01:43:58,614 --> 01:44:01,366
<font color="#616161">Harry, I don't like this.</font>

1104
01:44:06,497 --> 01:44:09,708
<font color="#616161">~ Harry, I don't like this at all. 
~ Shush!</font>

1105
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,764
<font color="#616161">Can we go back now?</font>

1106
01:44:23,931 --> 01:44:25,682
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1107
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:18,152
<font color="#616161">Who is it?</font>

1108
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:19,945
<font color="#616161">Don't panic.</font>

1109
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:21,780
<font color="#616161">Hagrid?</font>

1110
01:45:22,197 --> 01:45:23,782
<font color="#616161">Is that you?</font>

1111
01:45:24,366 --> 01:45:26,285
<font color="#616161">We're friends of Hagrid's.</font>

1112
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:47,598
<font color="#616161">And you? You're
Aragog, aren't you?</font>

1113
01:45:48,223 --> 01:45:49,516
<font color="#616161">Yes.</font>

1114
01:45:49,683 --> 01:45:53,479
<font color="#616161">Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.</font>

1115
01:45:53,645 --> 01:45:56,773
<font color="#616161">He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks.</font>

1116
01:45:57,399 --> 01:45:59,234
<font color="#616161">They think it's Hagrid.</font>

1117
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:03,030
<font color="#616161">They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.</font>

1118
01:46:03,238 --> 01:46:05,574
<font color="#616161">That's a lie.</font>

1119
01:46:06,033 --> 01:46:08,952
<font color="#616161">Hagrid never opened the
Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1120
01:46:09,578 --> 01:46:12,456
<font color="#616161">~ Then you're not the monster?
~ No.</font>

1121
01:46:12,623 --> 01:46:15,667
<font color="#616161">The monster was born in the castle.</font>

1122
01:46:15,876 --> 01:46:21,173
<font color="#616161">I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.</font>

1123
01:46:21,799 --> 01:46:23,425
<font color="#616161">Harry.</font>

1124
01:46:25,344 --> 01:46:29,932
<font color="#616161">But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 
50 years ago?</font>

1125
01:46:30,098 --> 01:46:33,101
<font color="#616161">We do not speak of it.</font>

1126
01:46:33,435 --> 01:46:38,982
<font color="#616161">It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.</font>

1127
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:40,943
<font color="#616161">But have you seen it?</font>

1128
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:47,449
<font color="#616161">I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid 
kept me.</font>

1129
01:46:47,616 --> 01:46:50,786
<font color="#616161">The girl was discovered in a bathroom.</font>

1130
01:46:50,953 --> 01:46:55,457
<font color="#616161">When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.</font>

1131
01:46:55,624 --> 01:46:57,626
<font color="#616161">~ Harry!
~ What?</font>

1132
01:47:10,472 --> 01:47:13,475
<font color="#616161">Well, thank you.</font>

1133
01:47:14,434 --> 01:47:16,603
<font color="#616161">We'll just go.</font>

1134
01:47:17,062 --> 01:47:18,814
<font color="#616161">Go?</font>

1135
01:47:19,022 --> 01:47:20,816
<font color="#616161">I think not.</font>

1136
01:47:20,983 --> 01:47:26,446
<font color="#616161">My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.</font>

1137
01:47:26,613 --> 01:47:29,032
<font color="#616161">But I cannot deny them fresh meat....</font>

1138
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:33,537
<font color="#616161">....when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.</font>

1139
01:47:33,704 --> 01:47:37,499
<font color="#616161">Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.</font>

1140
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:39,501
<font color="#616161">Can we panic now?</font>

1141
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,139
<font color="#616161">Know any spells?</font>

1142
01:47:52,306 --> 01:47:55,476
<font color="#616161">One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.</font>

1143
01:47:55,642 --> 01:47:58,395
<font color="#616161">Where's Hermione
when you need her?</font>

1144
01:48:11,909 --> 01:48:13,202
<font color="#616161">Let's go!</font>

1145
01:48:18,332 --> 01:48:20,417
<font color="#616161">Arania Exumai!</font>

1146
01:48:25,714 --> 01:48:27,049
<font color="#616161">Go!</font>

1147
01:48:45,025 --> 01:48:47,110
<font color="#616161">Glad we're out of there.</font>

1148
01:48:54,076 --> 01:48:56,411
<font color="#616161">Arania Exumai!</font>

1149
01:49:02,126 --> 01:49:05,879
<font color="#616161">~ Thanks for that.
~ Don't mention it.</font>

1150
01:49:16,807 --> 01:49:18,976
<font color="#616161">Get us out of here.</font>

1151
01:49:19,476 --> 01:49:21,145
<font color="#616161">Now!</font>

1152
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:27,484
<font color="#616161">Come on! Come on, move faster!</font>

1153
01:49:30,154 --> 01:49:31,488
<font color="#616161">Come on! Go!</font>

1154
01:49:49,006 --> 01:49:51,049
<font color="#616161">Get us in the air.</font>

1155
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:53,594
<font color="#616161">The flying gear's jammed!</font>

1156
01:49:57,681 --> 01:50:01,477
<font color="#616161">~ Come on! Pull!
~ I'm trying!</font>

1157
01:50:30,798 --> 01:50:33,717
<font color="#616161">Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.</font>

1158
01:50:33,884 --> 01:50:38,222
<font color="#616161">If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him.</font>

1159
01:50:52,236 --> 01:50:55,447
<font color="#616161">I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?</font>

1160
01:50:55,614 --> 01:51:00,244
<font color="#616161">~ What have we found out?
~ We know one thing.</font>

1161
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:03,789
<font color="#616161">Hagrid never opened the
Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1162
01:51:03,997 --> 01:51:05,999
<font color="#616161">He was innocent.</font>

1163
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:23,934
<font color="#616161">Wish you were here, Hermione.</font>

1164
01:51:24,476 --> 01:51:26,770
<font color="#616161">We need you.</font>

1165
01:51:27,688 --> 01:51:29,773
<font color="#616161">Now more than ever.</font>

1166
01:51:46,707 --> 01:51:50,127
<font color="#616161">~ What's that?
~ Ron....</font>

1167
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:55,424
<font color="#616161">This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.</font>

1168
01:51:55,966 --> 01:51:57,217
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1169
01:51:57,885 --> 01:52:00,846
<font color="#616161">"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land...."</font>

1170
01:52:01,013 --> 01:52:05,642
<font color="#616161">....none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living 
for hundreds of years....</font>

1171
01:52:05,809 --> 01:52:09,605
<font color="#616161">....instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.</font>

1172
01:52:09,771 --> 01:52:12,774
<font color="#616161">"Spiders flee before
it." Ron, this is it.</font>

1173
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:15,736
<font color="#616161">The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.</font>

1174
01:52:15,903 --> 01:52:19,823
<font color="#616161">That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.</font>

1175
01:52:20,157 --> 01:52:25,454
<font color="#616161">But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it 
no one's dead?</font>

1176
01:52:36,089 --> 01:52:39,009
<font color="#616161">Because no one did look it in the eye.</font>

1177
01:52:40,969 --> 01:52:43,555
<font color="#616161">Not directly, at least.</font>

1178
01:52:44,807 --> 01:52:47,017
<font color="#616161">Colin saw it through his camera.</font>

1179
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:51,230
<font color="#616161">Justin.... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly 
Headless Nick.</font>

1180
01:52:51,396 --> 01:52:55,400
<font color="#616161">Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.</font>

1181
01:52:55,567 --> 01:52:58,695
<font color="#616161">And Hermione had the mirror.</font>

1182
01:52:58,862 --> 01:53:02,241
<font color="#616161">I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.</font>

1183
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:03,700
<font color="#616161">And Mrs. Norris?</font>

1184
01:53:03,867 --> 01:53:07,371
<font color="#616161">I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.</font>

1185
01:53:08,914 --> 01:53:10,791
<font color="#616161">The water.</font>

1186
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:16,839
<font color="#616161">There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the 
basilisk's reflection.</font>

1187
01:53:22,970 --> 01:53:24,888
<font color="#616161">"Spiders flee before it."</font>

1188
01:53:25,055 --> 01:53:28,809
<font color="#616161">~ It all fits. 
~ How's a basilisk been getting around?</font>

1189
01:53:28,976 --> 01:53:31,812
<font color="#616161">A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.</font>

1190
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:37,651
<font color="#616161">~ Hermione's answered that too. 
~ Pipes? It's using the plumbing.</font>

1191
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:42,072
<font color="#616161">Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?</font>

1192
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:46,493
<font color="#616161">She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?</font>

1193
01:53:47,161 --> 01:53:48,495
<font color="#616161">Moaning Myrtle.</font>

1194
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:53,500
<font color="#616161">All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.</font>

1195
01:53:53,667 --> 01:53:57,087
<font color="#616161">All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.</font>

1196
01:54:02,092 --> 01:54:07,931
<font color="#616161">As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.</font>

1197
01:54:08,098 --> 01:54:10,309
<font color="#616161">Our worst fear has been realized.</font>

1198
01:54:10,476 --> 01:54:15,063
<font color="#616161">A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.</font>

1199
01:54:16,106 --> 01:54:21,778
<font color="#616161">The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.</font>

1200
01:54:24,156 --> 01:54:26,617
<font color="#616161">So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?</font>

1201
01:54:26,783 --> 01:54:31,121
<font color="#616161">A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment 
has come at last.</font>

1202
01:54:31,288 --> 01:54:34,249
<font color="#616161">~ My moment? 
~ Weren't you saying just last night....</font>

1203
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:38,962
<font color="#616161">....that you've known all along where the entrance to the 
Chamber of Secrets is?</font>

1204
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:45,803
<font color="#616161">That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.</font>

1205
01:54:45,969 --> 01:54:51,141
<font color="#616161">~ Your skills, after all, are legend. 
~ Very well.</font>

1206
01:54:51,308 --> 01:54:54,520
<font color="#616161">I'll just be in my office getting....</font>

1207
01:54:55,354 --> 01:54:57,314
<font color="#616161">Getting ready.</font>

1208
01:55:00,234 --> 01:55:03,445
<font color="#616161">Who is it that the
monster's taken, Minerva?</font>

1209
01:55:03,612 --> 01:55:05,447
<font color="#616161">Ginny Weasley.</font>

1210
01:55:16,834 --> 01:55:19,920
<font color="#616161">"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."</font>

1211
01:55:23,966 --> 01:55:25,759
<font color="#616161">Ginny.</font>

1212
01:55:27,845 --> 01:55:31,348
<font color="#616161">Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.</font>

1213
01:55:31,515 --> 01:55:34,226
<font color="#616161">At least we can tell
him what we know.</font>

1214
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:38,147
<font color="#616161">Professor, we have some
information for you.</font>

1215
01:55:39,898 --> 01:55:41,859
<font color="#616161">Are you going somewhere?</font>

1216
01:55:42,025 --> 01:55:45,154
<font color="#616161">Well, yes. Urgent call.
Unavoidable. Got to go.</font>

1217
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:48,532
<font color="#616161">~ What about my sister?
~ Well....</font>

1218
01:55:48,866 --> 01:55:52,369
<font color="#616161">As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.</font>

1219
01:55:52,536 --> 01:55:56,540
<font color="#616161">You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't 
go now.</font>

1220
01:55:56,707 --> 01:55:59,710
<font color="#616161">I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description....</font>

1221
01:55:59,877 --> 01:56:01,044
<font color="#616161">You're running away?</font>

1222
01:56:01,211 --> 01:56:04,006
<font color="#616161">~ After all you did in your books? 
~ Books can be misleading.</font>

1223
01:56:04,173 --> 01:56:06,717
<font color="#616161">~ You wrote them. 
~ My dear boy, use your common sense.</font>

1224
01:56:06,884 --> 01:56:11,305
<font color="#616161">My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think 
I'd done those things.</font>

1225
01:56:11,889 --> 01:56:13,474
<font color="#616161">You're a fraud.</font>

1226
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:16,435
<font color="#616161">You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.</font>

1227
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:18,562
<font color="#616161">Is there anything you can do?</font>

1228
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:23,442
<font color="#616161">Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.</font>

1229
01:56:23,609 --> 01:56:26,111
<font color="#616161">Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing.</font>

1230
01:56:26,278 --> 01:56:29,406
<font color="#616161">I'd never have sold another book.</font>

1231
01:56:29,573 --> 01:56:35,287
<font color="#616161">In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you.</font>

1232
01:56:35,788 --> 01:56:38,582
<font color="#616161">Don't even think about it.</font>

1233
01:56:49,426 --> 01:56:50,886
<font color="#616161">Who's there?</font>

1234
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:55,349
<font color="#616161">Hello, Harry.</font>

1235
01:56:56,266 --> 01:57:01,438
<font color="#616161">~ What do you want?
~ To ask you how you died.</font>

1236
01:57:03,816 --> 01:57:06,276
<font color="#616161">It was dreadful.</font>

1237
01:57:06,443 --> 01:57:10,113
<font color="#616161">It happened right here 
in this very cubicle.</font>

1238
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:14,326
<font color="#616161">I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.</font>

1239
01:57:14,493 --> 01:57:19,414
<font color="#616161">I was crying, and then I
heard somebody come in.</font>

1240
01:57:19,581 --> 01:57:25,321
<font color="#616161">~ Who was it, Myrtle? 
~ I don't know. I was distraught!</font>

1241
01:57:27,214 --> 01:57:30,634
<font color="#616161">But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language.</font>

1242
01:57:30,801 --> 01:57:36,141
<font color="#616161">And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him 
to go away and....</font>

1243
01:57:38,308 --> 01:57:43,147
<font color="#616161">~ ....I died.
~ Just like that? How?</font>

1244
01:57:43,313 --> 01:57:47,818
<font color="#616161">I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes....</font>

1245
01:57:47,985 --> 01:57:51,822
<font color="#616161">....over there by that sink.</font>

1246
01:58:16,930 --> 01:58:18,974
<font color="#616161">This is it.</font>

1247
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:24,688
<font color="#616161">This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1248
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:31,528
<font color="#616161">Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue.</font>

1249
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:27,167
<font color="#616161">Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well, then, I'll just be....</font>

1250
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:29,586
<font color="#616161">There's no need for me to stay.</font>

1251
01:59:30,212 --> 01:59:32,089
<font color="#616161">Yes, there is.</font>

1252
01:59:33,924 --> 01:59:37,010
<font color="#616161">~ You first. 
~ Now, boys, what good will it do?</font>

1253
01:59:37,177 --> 01:59:38,512
<font color="#616161">Better you than us.</font>

1254
01:59:39,721 --> 01:59:42,641
<font color="#616161">But.... Obviously, yes.</font>

1255
01:59:46,937 --> 01:59:49,648
<font color="#616161">Sure you don't want to test it first?</font>

1256
01:59:56,446 --> 01:59:59,700
<font color="#616161">It's really quite filthy down here.</font>

1257
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:04,705
<font color="#616161">~ All right. Let's go.
~ Oh, Harry?</font>

1258
02:00:05,122 --> 02:00:10,043
<font color="#616161">If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.</font>

1259
02:00:12,588 --> 02:00:14,548
<font color="#616161">Thanks, Myrtle.</font>

1260
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:48,832
<font color="#616161">Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.</font>

1261
02:00:49,792 --> 02:00:51,460
<font color="#616161">Go on.</font>

1262
02:00:55,172 --> 02:00:56,507
<font color="#616161">This way.</font>

1263
02:01:03,514 --> 02:01:08,769
<font color="#616161">~ What's this?
~ It looks like a snake.</font>

1264
02:01:08,936 --> 02:01:12,606
<font color="#616161">~ It's a snakeskin.
~ Bloody hell.</font>

1265
02:01:12,773 --> 02:01:18,570
<font color="#616161">Whatever shed this must
be 60 feet long. Or more.</font>

1266
02:01:20,489 --> 02:01:23,450
<font color="#616161">Heart of a lion, this one.</font>

1267
02:01:27,162 --> 02:01:31,834
<font color="#616161">The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret.</font>

1268
02:01:33,752 --> 02:01:39,216
<font color="#616161">The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl.</font>

1269
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:43,053
<font color="#616161">How you two tragically
lost your minds....</font>

1270
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:46,223
<font color="#616161">....at the sight of her mangled body.</font>

1271
02:01:47,057 --> 02:01:48,517
<font color="#616161">So....</font>

1272
02:01:49,643 --> 02:01:51,979
<font color="#616161">You first, Mr. Potter.</font>

1273
02:01:52,229 --> 02:01:55,399
<font color="#616161">Say goodbye to your memories.</font>

1274
02:01:57,442 --> 02:01:59,403
<font color="#616161">Obliviate!</font>

1275
02:02:33,312 --> 02:02:36,440
<font color="#616161">~ Ron! Ron, are you okay?
~ I'm fine.</font>

1276
02:02:40,194 --> 02:02:41,945
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

1277
02:02:42,613 --> 02:02:44,448
<font color="#616161">Who are you?</font>

1278
02:02:45,824 --> 02:02:48,494
<font color="#616161">~ Ron Weasley.
~ Really?</font>

1279
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:51,538
<font color="#616161">And who am I?</font>

1280
02:02:53,290 --> 02:02:57,628
<font color="#616161">Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is.</font>

1281
02:02:57,961 --> 02:03:02,466
<font color="#616161">It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?</font>

1282
02:03:02,633 --> 02:03:04,760
<font color="#616161">Do you live here?</font>

1283
02:03:05,469 --> 02:03:07,971
<font color="#616161">~ No.
~ Really?</font>

1284
02:03:12,559 --> 02:03:14,353
<font color="#616161">~ What do I do now?
~ You wait here....</font>

1285
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:17,481
<font color="#616161">....and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.</font>

1286
02:03:17,648 --> 02:03:21,318
<font color="#616161">~ I'll go on and find Ginny.
~ Okay.</font>

1287
02:04:54,536 --> 02:04:58,415
<font color="#616161">Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up, wake up.</font>

1288
02:04:58,916 --> 02:05:01,001
<font color="#616161">Please wake up.</font>

1289
02:05:01,251 --> 02:05:03,420
<font color="#616161">She won't wake.</font>

1290
02:05:08,884 --> 02:05:13,222
<font color="#616161">Tom. Tom Riddle. What do
you mean, she won't wake?</font>

1291
02:05:13,388 --> 02:05:16,767
<font color="#616161">~ She's not....? 
~ She's still alive, but only just.</font>

1292
02:05:17,768 --> 02:05:20,062
<font color="#616161">~ Are you a ghost?
~ A memory....</font>

1293
02:05:20,229 --> 02:05:22,606
<font color="#616161">....preserved in a
diary for 50 years.</font>

1294
02:05:25,275 --> 02:05:30,489
<font color="#616161">She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.</font>

1295
02:05:30,656 --> 02:05:33,075
<font color="#616161">You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk.</font>

1296
02:05:33,242 --> 02:05:35,828
<font color="#616161">It won't come until it's called.</font>

1297
02:05:38,622 --> 02:05:41,458
<font color="#616161">~ Give me my wand, Tom.
~ You won't be needing it.</font>

1298
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:45,921
<font color="#616161">~ We've got to go. We've got to save her. 
~ I'm afraid I can't do that.</font>

1299
02:05:46,088 --> 02:05:50,134
<font color="#616161">You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.</font>

1300
02:05:51,468 --> 02:05:55,973
<font color="#616161">Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1301
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:58,475
<font color="#616161">No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.</font>

1302
02:05:58,642 --> 02:06:01,854
<font color="#616161">It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat....</font>

1303
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:04,481
<font color="#616161">....Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.</font>

1304
02:06:04,648 --> 02:06:07,943
<font color="#616161">~ But why?
~ Because I told her to.</font>

1305
02:06:08,110 --> 02:06:13,073
<font color="#616161">You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew 
what she was doing.</font>

1306
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:16,577
<font color="#616161">She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.</font>

1307
02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:19,621
<font color="#616161">Still, the power of the
diary began to scare her.</font>

1308
02:06:19,788 --> 02:06:22,166
<font color="#616161">She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.</font>

1309
02:06:22,332 --> 02:06:26,670
<font color="#616161">And then who should find it but you?</font>

1310
02:06:26,837 --> 02:06:29,965
<font color="#616161">The very person I was most anxious to meet.</font>

1311
02:06:30,549 --> 02:06:32,634
<font color="#616161">And why did you want to meet me?</font>

1312
02:06:33,010 --> 02:06:36,388
<font color="#616161">I knew I had to talk to
you, meet you if I could.</font>

1313
02:06:36,555 --> 02:06:39,850
<font color="#616161">So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid....</font>

1314
02:06:40,017 --> 02:06:43,187
<font color="#616161">~ ....to gain your trust.
~ Hagrid's my friend.</font>

1315
02:06:44,104 --> 02:06:48,692
<font color="#616161">~ And you framed him, didn't you? 
~ It was my word against Hagrid's.</font>

1316
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:52,154
<font color="#616161">Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.</font>

1317
02:06:52,321 --> 02:06:54,490
<font color="#616161">I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.</font>

1318
02:06:54,656 --> 02:06:58,118
<font color="#616161">He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.</font>

1319
02:06:58,285 --> 02:07:01,580
<font color="#616161">I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while 
I was at school....</font>

1320
02:07:01,747 --> 02:07:03,582
<font color="#616161">....so I decided to leave behind a diary....</font>

1321
02:07:03,749 --> 02:07:05,876
<font color="#616161">....preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages....</font>

1322
02:07:06,043 --> 02:07:08,712
<font color="#616161">....so that one day I would be able to lead another....</font>

1323
02:07:08,879 --> 02:07:11,715
<font color="#616161">....to finish Salazar
Slytherin's noble work.</font>

1324
02:07:11,882 --> 02:07:14,134
<font color="#616161">Well, you haven't
finished it this time.</font>

1325
02:07:14,301 --> 02:07:17,262
<font color="#616161">In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready.</font>

1326
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:20,182
<font color="#616161">And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.</font>

1327
02:07:20,557 --> 02:07:25,813
<font color="#616161">Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.</font>

1328
02:07:26,063 --> 02:07:30,859
<font color="#616161">For many months now, my
new target has been you.</font>

1329
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:35,906
<font color="#616161">How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent....</font>

1330
02:07:36,073 --> 02:07:38,742
<font color="#616161">....was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?</font>

1331
02:07:39,076 --> 02:07:42,037
<font color="#616161">How did you escape with
nothing but a scar....</font>

1332
02:07:42,204 --> 02:07:44,581
<font color="#616161">....while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?</font>

1333
02:07:44,748 --> 02:07:48,919
<font color="#616161">Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.</font>

1334
02:07:49,086 --> 02:07:54,992
<font color="#616161">Voldemort is my past, present and future.</font>

1335
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:19,450
<font color="#616161">You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.</font>

1336
02:08:22,619 --> 02:08:26,206
<font color="#616161">~ You're Voldemort.
~ Surely you didn't think....</font>

1337
02:08:26,373 --> 02:08:30,878
<font color="#616161">....I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?</font>

1338
02:08:31,044 --> 02:08:35,215
<font color="#616161">No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere....</font>

1339
02:08:35,382 --> 02:08:39,595
<font color="#616161">....would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.</font>

1340
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:42,931
<font color="#616161">Albus Dumbledore is the
greatest sorcerer in the world.</font>

1341
02:08:43,098 --> 02:08:46,477
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.</font>

1342
02:08:46,685 --> 02:08:51,732
<font color="#616161">He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.</font>

1343
02:08:58,113 --> 02:08:59,156
<font color="#616161">Fawkes?</font>

1344
02:09:15,422 --> 02:09:19,009
<font color="#616161">So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.</font>

1345
02:09:19,176 --> 02:09:22,846
<font color="#616161">A songbird and an old hat.</font>

1346
02:09:36,151 --> 02:09:40,697
<font color="#616161">Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin....</font>

1347
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:44,868
<font color="#616161">....against the famous Harry Potter.</font>

1348
02:09:58,215 --> 02:10:02,553
<font color="#616161">Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me.</font>

1349
02:10:32,749 --> 02:10:34,293
<font color="#616161">No!</font>

1350
02:10:34,751 --> 02:10:39,256
<font color="#616161">Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still 
hear you.</font>

1351
02:12:21,233 --> 02:12:24,528
<font color="#616161">Yes, Potter. The process
is nearly complete.</font>

1352
02:12:24,695 --> 02:12:29,616
<font color="#616161">In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease 
to be a memory.</font>

1353
02:12:29,783 --> 02:12:32,453
<font color="#616161">Lord Voldemort will return....</font>

1354
02:12:32,828 --> 02:12:37,040
<font color="#616161">....very much alive.</font>

1355
02:12:37,749 --> 02:12:39,168
<font color="#616161">Ginny?</font>

1356
02:14:55,512 --> 02:14:57,097
<font color="#616161">Remarkable, isn't it....</font>

1357
02:14:57,264 --> 02:15:01,268
<font color="#616161">....how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?</font>

1358
02:15:01,435 --> 02:15:04,104
<font color="#616161">I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.</font>

1359
02:15:04,438 --> 02:15:08,484
<font color="#616161">You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.</font>

1360
02:15:13,489 --> 02:15:17,159
<font color="#616161">Funny, the damage a silly little book can do....</font>

1361
02:15:17,326 --> 02:15:22,372
<font color="#616161">....especially in the hands of a silly little girl.</font>

1362
02:15:25,209 --> 02:15:27,044
<font color="#616161">What are you doing?</font>

1363
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:32,007
<font color="#616161">Stop. No!</font>

1364
02:16:30,274 --> 02:16:34,278
<font color="#616161">It was me. But I swear,
I didn't mean to.</font>

1365
02:16:34,445 --> 02:16:37,948
<font color="#616161">Riddle made me, and....</font>

1366
02:16:38,449 --> 02:16:41,118
<font color="#616161">Harry, you're hurt.</font>

1367
02:16:41,452 --> 02:16:42,953
<font color="#616161">Don't worry.</font>

1368
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:46,790
<font color="#616161">Ginny, you need to get yourself out.</font>

1369
02:16:46,957 --> 02:16:50,210
<font color="#616161">Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.</font>

1370
02:17:02,347 --> 02:17:04,475
<font color="#616161">You were brilliant, Fawkes.</font>

1371
02:17:05,601 --> 02:17:08,020
<font color="#616161">I just wasn't quick enough.</font>

1372
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,542
<font color="#616161">Of course.</font>

1373
02:17:30,834 --> 02:17:33,670
<font color="#616161">Phoenix tears have healing powers.</font>

1374
02:17:35,297 --> 02:17:37,090
<font color="#616161">Thanks.</font>

1375
02:17:38,842 --> 02:17:40,969
<font color="#616161">It's all right, Ginny.</font>

1376
02:17:42,095 --> 02:17:44,306
<font color="#616161">It's over.</font>

1377
02:17:45,307 --> 02:17:47,851
<font color="#616161">It's just a memory.</font>

1378
02:17:50,729 --> 02:17:56,068
<font color="#616161">Amazing! This is just like magic!</font>

1379
02:18:07,371 --> 02:18:10,040
<font color="#616161">You both realize, of course....</font>

1380
02:18:10,207 --> 02:18:15,712
<font color="#616161">....that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen 
school rules.</font>

1381
02:18:16,338 --> 02:18:17,381
<font color="#616161">Yes, sir.</font>

1382
02:18:17,548 --> 02:18:20,759
<font color="#616161">There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.</font>

1383
02:18:20,926 --> 02:18:22,136
<font color="#616161">Yes, sir.</font>

1384
02:18:22,302 --> 02:18:25,055
<font color="#616161">Therefore, it is only fitting....</font>

1385
02:18:26,598 --> 02:18:28,892
<font color="#616161">....that you both receive....</font>

1386
02:18:29,393 --> 02:18:33,480
<font color="#616161">....Special Awards for
Services to the School.</font>

1387
02:18:35,566 --> 02:18:37,401
<font color="#616161">Thanks, sir.</font>

1388
02:18:37,985 --> 02:18:40,279
<font color="#616161">Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would....</font>

1389
02:18:40,446 --> 02:18:44,616
<font color="#616161">....have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.</font>

1390
02:18:45,742 --> 02:18:50,497
<font color="#616161">I believe we want our gamekeeper back.</font>

1391
02:18:55,461 --> 02:18:59,798
<font color="#616161">First, I want to thank you, Harry.</font>

1392
02:19:00,424 --> 02:19:03,927
<font color="#616161">You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.</font>

1393
02:19:04,803 --> 02:19:09,391
<font color="#616161">Nothing but that could
have called Fawkes to you.</font>

1394
02:19:11,768 --> 02:19:13,312
<font color="#616161">And....</font>

1395
02:19:13,896 --> 02:19:15,314
<font color="#616161">....second....</font>

1396
02:19:15,481 --> 02:19:20,277
<font color="#616161">....I sense that something is troubling you.</font>

1397
02:19:20,486 --> 02:19:22,988
<font color="#616161">Am I right, Harry?</font>

1398
02:19:24,823 --> 02:19:26,575
<font color="#616161">It's just....</font>

1399
02:19:27,743 --> 02:19:32,456
<font color="#616161">You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain....</font>

1400
02:19:32,623 --> 02:19:38,295
<font color="#616161">Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.</font>

1401
02:19:38,837 --> 02:19:40,047
<font color="#616161">I see.</font>

1402
02:19:40,214 --> 02:19:46,011
<font color="#616161">Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?</font>

1403
02:19:46,470 --> 02:19:51,975
<font color="#616161">Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.</font>

1404
02:19:53,185 --> 02:19:55,938
<font color="#616161">If I'm not mistaken, Harry....</font>

1405
02:19:56,313 --> 02:20:00,150
<font color="#616161">....he transferred some
of his powers to you....</font>

1406
02:20:00,317 --> 02:20:03,278
<font color="#616161">....the night he
gave you that scar.</font>

1407
02:20:03,445 --> 02:20:07,324
<font color="#616161">Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?</font>

1408
02:20:09,243 --> 02:20:11,954
<font color="#616161">Not intentionally....</font>

1409
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:14,748
<font color="#616161">....but yes.</font>

1410
02:20:16,667 --> 02:20:20,003
<font color="#616161">So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be in Slytherin.</font>

1411
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:25,008
<font color="#616161">It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort 
himself prizes.</font>

1412
02:20:25,175 --> 02:20:28,011
<font color="#616161">Determination, resourcefulness....</font>

1413
02:20:28,178 --> 02:20:32,182
<font color="#616161">....and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules.</font>

1414
02:20:32,891 --> 02:20:36,895
<font color="#616161">Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?</font>

1415
02:20:37,729 --> 02:20:41,400
<font color="#616161">~ Because I asked it to.
~ Exactly, Harry. Exactly.</font>

1416
02:20:41,567 --> 02:20:43,652
<font color="#616161">Which makes you different from Voldemort.</font>

1417
02:20:43,819 --> 02:20:47,698
<font color="#616161">It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.</font>

1418
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:50,117
<font color="#616161">It is our choices.</font>

1419
02:20:53,787 --> 02:20:57,207
<font color="#616161">If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor....</font>

1420
02:20:57,374 --> 02:21:02,254
<font color="#616161">....then I suggest you look more closely at this.</font>

1421
02:21:03,255 --> 02:21:04,923
<font color="#616161">Be careful.</font>

1422
02:21:10,596 --> 02:21:13,265
<font color="#616161">Godric Gryffindor.</font>

1423
02:21:13,432 --> 02:21:17,519
<font color="#616161">It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.</font>

1424
02:21:26,403 --> 02:21:27,780
<font color="#616161">Dobby.</font>

1425
02:21:29,072 --> 02:21:33,452
<font color="#616161">So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys.</font>

1426
02:21:35,621 --> 02:21:38,957
<font color="#616161">I'll deal with you later.</font>

1427
02:21:44,797 --> 02:21:46,423
<font color="#616161">Out of my way, Potter.</font>

1428
02:21:46,590 --> 02:21:50,177
<font color="#616161">So it's true. You have returned.</font>

1429
02:21:50,844 --> 02:21:53,639
<font color="#616161">When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter....</font>

1430
02:21:53,806 --> 02:21:57,976
<font color="#616161">....was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.</font>

1431
02:21:58,811 --> 02:22:02,898
<font color="#616161">~ Ridiculous. 
~ Curiously, Lucius, several of them....</font>

1432
02:22:03,065 --> 02:22:06,735
<font color="#616161">....were under the impression that you would curse their family....</font>

1433
02:22:06,902 --> 02:22:09,738
<font color="#616161">....if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.</font>

1434
02:22:10,197 --> 02:22:13,659
<font color="#616161">~ How dare you!
~ Beg your pardon?</font>

1435
02:22:13,826 --> 02:22:17,621
<font color="#616161">My sole concern has always been and will always be....</font>

1436
02:22:17,788 --> 02:22:20,624
<font color="#616161">....the welfare of this school....</font>

1437
02:22:20,791 --> 02:22:25,087
<font color="#616161">....and, of course, its students.</font>

1438
02:22:29,133 --> 02:22:33,345
<font color="#616161">The culprit has been
identified, I presume?</font>

1439
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:35,264
<font color="#616161">Yes.</font>

1440
02:22:36,849 --> 02:22:38,684
<font color="#616161">And?</font>

1441
02:22:39,852 --> 02:22:41,895
<font color="#616161">Who was it?</font>

1442
02:22:48,318 --> 02:22:50,863
<font color="#616161">Voldemort.</font>

1443
02:22:52,030 --> 02:22:57,494
<font color="#616161">Only this time he chose to act through somebody else....</font>

1444
02:22:58,036 --> 02:23:01,665
<font color="#616161">....by means of this.</font>

1445
02:23:04,334 --> 02:23:05,878
<font color="#616161">I see.</font>

1446
02:23:07,337 --> 02:23:11,550
<font color="#616161">Fortunately, our young
Mr. Potter discovered it.</font>

1447
02:23:11,884 --> 02:23:15,554
<font color="#616161">One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things....</font>

1448
02:23:15,721 --> 02:23:18,974
<font color="#616161">....should find their way into innocent hands.</font>

1449
02:23:19,308 --> 02:23:23,228
<font color="#616161">The consequences for the one responsible would be....</font>

1450
02:23:23,604 --> 02:23:25,481
<font color="#616161">....severe.</font>

1451
02:23:26,899 --> 02:23:29,693
<font color="#616161">Well, let us hope....</font>

1452
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:35,407
<font color="#616161">....that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.</font>

1453
02:23:36,158 --> 02:23:39,912
<font color="#616161">Don't worry. I will be.</font>

1454
02:23:48,670 --> 02:23:50,714
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore.</font>

1455
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:55,385
<font color="#616161">Come, Dobby. We're leaving.</font>

1456
02:24:12,653 --> 02:24:17,116
<font color="#616161">Sir? I wonder if I could have that?</font>

1457
02:24:23,539 --> 02:24:25,124
<font color="#616161">Mr. Malfoy.</font>

1458
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:27,501
<font color="#616161">Mr. Malfoy!</font>

1459
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:30,129
<font color="#616161">I have something of yours.</font>

1460
02:24:31,797 --> 02:24:34,758
<font color="#616161">Mine? I don't know what 
you're talking about.</font>

1461
02:24:34,925 --> 02:24:36,468
<font color="#616161">I think you do, sir.</font>

1462
02:24:36,635 --> 02:24:39,763
<font color="#616161">I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron....</font>

1463
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:41,348
<font color="#616161">....that day at Diagon Alley.</font>

1464
02:24:42,057 --> 02:24:44,601
<font color="#616161">You do, do you?</font>

1465
02:24:51,942 --> 02:24:55,028
<font color="#616161">Why don't you prove it?</font>

1466
02:25:01,285 --> 02:25:03,454
<font color="#616161">Come, Dobby.</font>

1467
02:25:04,746 --> 02:25:06,790
<font color="#616161">Open it.</font>

1468
02:25:10,294 --> 02:25:11,837
<font color="#616161">Dobby.</font>

1469
02:25:12,004 --> 02:25:15,174
<font color="#616161">Master has given Dobby a sock.</font>

1470
02:25:15,466 --> 02:25:17,551
<font color="#616161">What? I didn't give....</font>

1471
02:25:17,718 --> 02:25:21,430
<font color="#616161">Master has presented Dobby with clothes.</font>

1472
02:25:21,597 --> 02:25:24,641
<font color="#616161">Dobby is free.</font>

1473
02:25:31,190 --> 02:25:34,943
<font color="#616161">You lost me my servant!</font>

1474
02:25:41,909 --> 02:25:45,913
<font color="#616161">You shall not harm Harry Potter.</font>

1475
02:25:58,050 --> 02:26:01,762
<font color="#616161">Your parents were meddlesome fools too.</font>

1476
02:26:01,929 --> 02:26:05,098
<font color="#616161">Mark my words, Potter. One day soon....</font>

1477
02:26:05,265 --> 02:26:10,479
<font color="#616161">....you are going to meet the same sticky end.</font>

1478
02:26:16,193 --> 02:26:22,074
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him?</font>

1479
02:26:22,449 --> 02:26:26,703
<font color="#616161">~ Just promise me something.
~ Anything, sir.</font>

1480
02:26:28,664 --> 02:26:31,125
<font color="#616161">Never try to save my life again.</font>

1481
02:26:37,256 --> 02:26:40,259
<font color="#616161">~ Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
~ Thank you.</font>

1482
02:26:40,551 --> 02:26:42,928
<font color="#616161">~ Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
~ Good evening.</font>

1483
02:26:43,095 --> 02:26:46,014
<font color="#616161">~ Good to see you, Sir Nicholas. 
~ Thank you.</font>

1484
02:26:47,391 --> 02:26:49,601
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

1485
02:26:51,311 --> 02:26:55,941
<font color="#616161">~ Hermione! Welcome back.
~ Thanks, Sir Nicholas.</font>

1486
02:26:59,194 --> 02:27:02,531
<font color="#616161">Harry. It's Hermione.</font>

1487
02:27:29,349 --> 02:27:33,061
<font color="#616161">~ Welcome back, Hermione.
~ It's good to be back.</font>

1488
02:27:33,228 --> 02:27:35,814
<font color="#616161">Congratulations. I can't
believe you solved it.</font>

1489
02:27:35,981 --> 02:27:38,233
<font color="#616161">We had loads of help from you.</font>

1490
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:41,612
<font color="#616161">~ We couldn't have done it without you. 
~ Thanks.</font>

1491
02:27:43,447 --> 02:27:46,408
<font color="#616161">Could I have your attention, please?</font>

1492
02:27:50,579 --> 02:27:53,081
<font color="#616161">Before we begin the feast....</font>

1493
02:27:53,248 --> 02:27:59,005
<font color="#616161">....let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey....</font>

1494
02:27:59,671 --> 02:28:03,801
<font color="#616161">....whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered....</font>

1495
02:28:03,967 --> 02:28:06,637
<font color="#616161">....to all who had been Petrified.</font>

1496
02:28:17,147 --> 02:28:20,150
<font color="#616161">Also, in light of the recent events....</font>

1497
02:28:20,317 --> 02:28:22,486
<font color="#616161">....as a school treat....</font>

1498
02:28:22,653 --> 02:28:26,615
<font color="#616161">....all exams have been canceled.</font>

1499
02:28:29,284 --> 02:28:30,869
<font color="#616161">Oh, no.</font>

1500
02:28:47,803 --> 02:28:49,847
<font color="#616161">Sorry I'm late.</font>

1501
02:28:55,894 --> 02:29:00,315
<font color="#616161">The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.</font>

1502
02:29:00,649 --> 02:29:03,944
<font color="#616161">Some ruddy bird called Errol.</font>

1503
02:29:19,710 --> 02:29:24,716
<font color="#616161">And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron....</font>

1504
02:29:25,924 --> 02:29:28,886
<font color="#616161">....and Hermione, of course....</font>

1505
02:29:29,553 --> 02:29:33,640
<font color="#616161">....I would still be you-know-where....</font>

1506
02:29:33,807 --> 02:29:37,394
<font color="#616161">....so I'd just like
to say thanks.</font>

1507
02:29:46,779 --> 02:29:49,740
<font color="#616161">There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.</font>
