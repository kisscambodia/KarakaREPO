1
00:00:01,193 --> 00:00:04,613
This place is under
new management...

2
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:07,633
by order of the Peaky Blinders.

3
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:14,433
Just write down, "Peace
between the Jews and the Italians."

4
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:15,523
And war...

5
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,753
.. against the Gypsies.

6
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:20,593
'I love him, Tom.

7
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:21,753
'I know.'

8
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:24,873
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business

9
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:26,393
and put him charge of the new.

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,273
Some idiots at The Marquis Of Lorne.

11
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:31,273
They tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

12
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,593
We fought them off.

13
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:33,683
The Marquis, eh?

14
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,473
What do we want with
a 1,000 guinea horse?

15
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:42,873
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches

16
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:45,833
a good racehorse is a passport
to the owners' enclosure.

17
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:48,203
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

18
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:58,393
'I have made arrangements
with men I trust.'

19
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,153
If I should die...

20
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,643
then you will die.

for what we are about to receive,

may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:18,883

Amen.

57
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:33,473
The Passover started off
way out there in the Far East -

58
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,393
out in the sand, out in the desert,

59
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:36,833
where my forefathers come from -

60
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,073
the Jews, the brews,
whatever you want to call them.

61
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:42,193
~ DOOR RUMBLES SHUT
~ It started out as
a little speck on the horizon...

Arthur, this ain't right!

63
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,513
Billy, don't worry, mate.
If you want, you can leave.

64
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:48,993
If you need to go to the little
boy's room, you can leave.

65
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:51,993
~ We're going to open them in a minute
anyway. ~ He's all right. Billy Boy.

66
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,793
~ Do you want to leave?
~ No, you are all right.

67
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,313
~ You want to stay? ~ I'll stay.

68
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:58,993
You stay there, then, treacle. OK.

69
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:01,833
So, the Pharaoh,
have you heard of him?

70
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:05,513
He kept my people,
the Jewish people, in slavery

71
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:08,393
for thousands and thousands
of years.

72
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:09,913
Persecuted race.

73
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:15,313
He did, he persecuted my race.
The killing of the innocent, right?

74
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:18,993
Seder, this feast what we is
having here, right?

75
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:24,793
Seder is basically the day when
the Jewish angels decided, you know,

76
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:29,073
that the evil fucking Egyptians
had pushed their fucking luck.

77
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:33,353
~ Right. ~ It's part of our tradition,
to do with Seder, right,

78
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:37,203
that in order to make it good
with God to kill a king...

79
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:43,833
.. we have to carry out
the Korban Pesach.

80
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:50,353
~ Right. ~ That is the ritual sacrifice
of the Passover goat.

81
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,923
GOAT BLEATS

82
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:59,513
~ It's a goat! ~ Yeah,
and we are going to sacrifice it.

83
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:00,753
Tonight.

84
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:04,713
That is part of the reason why
we have to shut the doors as well.

85
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,993
But this year we thought we'd give
the fucking goat a name.

86
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,633
~ You've named it?
~ We fucking did. Yeah.

87
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:12,953
They named the fucking goat.

88
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:15,793
After the evil fucking
Egyptian pharaoh.

89
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:16,873
The fucking enemy!

90
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:18,673
That's right!
You know what we called him?

91
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:19,833
What did you call him?

92
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,003
Tommy Shelby.

93
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,393
GUNSHOT

00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,683
SHOUTING AND COMMOTION

95
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,753
Police! Stay where you are.

96
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:41,803
SHOUTING AND COMMOTION

97
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:45,153
GUNSHOT

98
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,753
You're all fired.

99
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,513
Fuck you!

100
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,043
That's right,
let's take the load off.

101
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:58,993
So, then the evil Egyptian scum

102
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:02,353
was finally cleansed

103
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,643
by the blood of the Passover goat.

104
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,083
That's from Sabini.

105
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,113
You tell your Gypsy king...

106
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:18,593
HE SCREAMS

107
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,873
.. that whoever comes down south

108
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,723
shall return north
in many fucking pieces.

109
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:30,083
KNIFE SLASHES FLESH,
HE SCREAMS

110
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,513
The fucking animal.
He come in here, right,

111
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:45,513
with a fucking gun and a razor,
he shot him in the face.

112
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:48,753
My lads, they restrained him.
Look at him. He is dead.

113
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:50,073
Is he dead?

114
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,553
He is fucking dead!

115
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:54,483
He wants arresting or some thing,
right? Surely.

116
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:04,473
Not again! Michael!
No, you can't take him away again!

117
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,993
You can't take my son away!

118
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:07,473
~ Give me the boy. ~ Come back here.

119
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:11,113
Listen, we are arresting him
for taking part in a fight...

120
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:13,073
Ow, you...!

121
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:16,153
Don't you fucking touch him!
Get off him!

122
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:19,153
Don't say anything.
Tommy will get you out.

123
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:20,523
I'll be all right...

124
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:30,683
You should know that, as of this
night, Tommy Shelby is finished.

125
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:48,203
Mick, this is Thomas Shelby.
He's come to check up on his filly.

126
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,483
Yes. I've heard about him.

127
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:55,313
Micky is the best horseman
in England.

128
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:59,393
He likes to waste money,
I know that.

129
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,393
According to the reports
I've been given

130
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,633
you're spending £2 a month
on worming powder.

131
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,513
What? You want a horse with worms?

132
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:07,473
Horses get worms
from the water trough.

133
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,953
If you put goldfish in them,
they eat the worm eggs.

134
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,283
Goldfish?

135
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,433
That'll be a Gypsy thing, is it?

136
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,993
No, it's an accounting thing.

137
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:18,873
Goldfish cost a penny each.

138
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,683
Or you can win them at the fair.

139
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,033
If you want, I'll dispense
with the vet altogether.

140
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,283
Excuse me.

141
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,683
Did you ever consider
a career in diplomacy?

142
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,433
Hello, hello. How are you, eh?

143
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:42,993
Goldfish? Seriously?

144
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:46,323
Yep. You people have a lot to learn.

145
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,803
They asked me if I wanted
a fire in the guest bedroom.

146
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,203
I said no.

147
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:15,203
Just one fire tonight.

148
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:19,033
Bold and fearless, eh?

149
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,443
Yes.

150
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:23,803
Though I'm not really fearless.

151
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,883
~ Drink? ~ Why not?

152
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:50,793
Madam, there is a telephone call.

153
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,713
I'll take it in the drawing room.

154
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:54,123
It's for Mr Shelby.

155
00:09:58,163 --> 00:09:59,323
We had a deal.

156
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:02,513
Hey?

157
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,083
We had a fucking deal!

158
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:09,873
I would thank you to moderate your
language in a place of worship.

159
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,123
We had a fucking deal.

160
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:16,763
Mr Shelby.

161
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:23,873
If you read the papers, you might
have seen that the Home Secretary

162
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:29,313
has got himself into a bit of a fizz
about certain moral issues.

163
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,833
Prostitution, protection,

164
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,553
racketeering, drinking,

165
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:35,673
cocaine and, of course...

166
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,083
gambling.

167
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,113
He has demanded results.

168
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:45,193
You offered me protection.
You promised me protection.

169
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:49,803
Well, no, you see it was Mr Churchill
that made you that promise.

170
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:54,843
And the Home Secretary
outranks him, so...

171
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,833
And I can hardly be blamed
if your demented brother

172
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:02,393
decides to go on some sort of
blood orgy during dinner.

173
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:03,873
Don't fucking lie to me!

174
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,843
SHOUTS: Do not sit here in your
fucking church and lie to me!

175
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,633
You will need to
contain your emotions

176
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:13,843
or this meeting is at an end.

177
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:24,483
Good.

178
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:27,243
That's better.

179
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:30,723
So...

180
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:35,633
.. let us review the new situation.

181
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:38,073
I have your brother
in a prison cell

182
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:40,793
charged with the murder
of Billy Kitchen.

183
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:43,993
The case against him is strong

184
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:47,323
and I have no doubt
that his destiny is to hang.

185
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:51,113
And then there is Polly's son,
Michael.

186
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:56,083
He has already admitted to helping
Arthur burn down the Marquis pub.

187
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:01,833
He was a tough nut to crack,
that boy, but crack he did.

188
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:05,033
So I have your brother
facing the noose,

189
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,673
I have your cousin facing
five years for arson.

190
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:12,313
And I have your entire organisation
in disarray

191
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:13,913
in Birmingham and in London.

192
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:15,123
What do you want?

193
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:17,403
What do I want?!

194
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,483
I don't understand.

195
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:25,723
I have already agreed to
do your fucking killing for you.

196
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:30,123
Now, what is it you want from me?

197
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:33,603
There you go, you see.

198
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:40,803
An agreement is not the same thing
as an assurance, now, is it?

199
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:48,193
You see, I found...
I wasn't sleeping so well.

200
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:54,033
It wasn't just the smell
and the noise in that room, no.

201
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,403
It was the nagging doubt.
The knowledge...

202
00:12:58,483 --> 00:12:59,843
The knowledge that...

203
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:04,563
.. Tommy Shelby is not afraid to die.

204
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:08,003
Therefore...

205
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:12,673
.. the threat to your own life
might not be enough

206
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:17,123
to make it certain that you will
obey me on the given day.

207
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:24,393
I needed also the power of life
and death over your family.

208
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:26,873
And that I now have.

209
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:27,993
Your brother.

210
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:29,633
Your cousin.

211
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,963
And your sister.

212
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:38,113
I have known her address in Primrose
Hill since the day she moved in.

213
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:42,953
She is safe
only as long as I want her to be.

214
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:44,843
I have been ahead of you...

215
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:47,523
.. every step of the way.

216
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,443
And, as my father used to say...

217
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:54,873
.. to make sure your dog obeys you,

218
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:58,043
you have to show it the stick
once in a while.

219
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:06,393
PHONE RINGS

220
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:08,633
Tommy, Arthur is in
solitary confinement.

221
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,353
Michael is in the remand wing of...

222
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:12,323
I already know.
Get out, shut the doors.

223
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,963
PHONE CONTINUES TO RING

224
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,683
'Tommy?

225
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:31,523
'It's me.'

226
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:36,043
Tommy, can you hear me?

227
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,593
Yes, er, Grace.

228
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,803
I think you called.
I... haven't slept.

229
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:47,913
Grace, this is not a good time.

230
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,753
I can call you back.

231
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,443
~ No, it's fine. It's all right.
~ Can we meet?

232
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,913
Yes. We'll meet.

233
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,123
When?

234
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,483
Grace, there are some things
I have to do first.

235
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:14,603
John?

236
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:18,673
The coppers have lifted
ten of our men in Camden Town,

237
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,433
the rest of them are on the run.

238
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,273
~ They've taken Michael.
~ Business first.

239
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:24,513
~ They took Michael last night.
~ I said business first.

240
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:26,553
~ They picked him up...
~ Polly, business first!

241
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:27,953
John?

242
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,593
They took all our whisky,

243
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,913
so no doubt they'll be
supping that for Christmas.

244
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:37,683
They've impounded all our vans,
put their own locks on the warehouse.

245
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:43,113
The Eden Club and all our pubs
have been raided by the coppers

246
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,643
and handed back to
Sabini and Solomons.

247
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,513
The Black Country boys
think it was Arthur killed Billy

248
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,593
because that's what
the coppers told them.

249
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:55,593
So there'll be no more free passes
for our whisky boats.

250
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:57,673
I don't give a fuck about whisky.

251
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,633
I don't give a fuck
about Billy Kitchen.

252
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:02,593
I want my son out of prison. Now.

253
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:04,033
Thomas, I spoke to Johnny Dogs.

254
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,633
This meeting should just be family.

255
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:08,753
~ I can help. ~ It's family only, she is
not blood, Tommy! ~ Let her speak.

256
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:11,643
~ Or is this a business...?
Have you forgotten...? ~ ENOUGH!

257
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,713
Enough, Polly.

258
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:15,763
Esme?

259
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:19,433
I spoke to Johnny Dogs.
The Lees are kin.

260
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,553
~ The bloody Lees!
~ They can give us men!

261
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,633
We don't need more fucking men!

262
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,193
It's men that have done the damage!

263
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:30,033
It... It is men
fighting like cockerels

264
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,803
that have put us
here in the first place.

265
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:35,283
Esme, I'll take up their offer.
We need men.

266
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:47,473
If Michael ever gets out of prison,

267
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,033
I am taking him away
from this family.

268
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,603
For good.

269
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,763
This life is bad.

270
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:02,273
This life is all bad.

271
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:04,483
~ Aunt Pol, what are you doing?
~ Shut up and walk.

272
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,683
DOOR CLOSES

273
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,123
Thomas?

274
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,163
Should I go and speak to
Queen Mary Lee at the Black Patch?

275
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:26,313
Yes.

276
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:28,753
She can give us soldiers
for a few nights.

277
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:29,883
Mm, good.

278
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:36,243
John, go and bring up the car.

279
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:56,953
DOOR CLOSES

280
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:59,633
Imagine riding away, Thomas.

281
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:02,193
Living the real life, you know?

282
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:04,803
Your Gypsy half is the stronger.

283
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:08,923
You just want to ride away.

284
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,993
France is the new place
for us, they say.

285
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,083
Lot of metal lying around still.

286
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:20,883
Guns and trucks and spent shells
and things.

287
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:23,483
Then you go south.

288
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:30,193
Saintes-Maries,
where the Black Madonna is.

289
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,643
My brothers go sometimes
for the fair.

290
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,083
It's like a home for us.

291
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,003
They still let you get lost there.

292
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:56,043
I've been to France, Esme.

293
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:59,403
So has John.

294
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:03,313
Now get your coat

295
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:05,243
and go with your husband.

296
00:19:14,923 --> 00:19:17,113
And if you ever talk about
getting lost again,

297
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:18,203
I will cut you...

298
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,083
.. from this family.

299
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:32,603
What family?

300
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,523
KEYS CLANK IN LOCK

301
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:53,353
KNOCK AT DOOR
Come in.

302
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,593
DOOR OPENS

303
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:58,473
MALE VOICES IN BACKGROUND

304
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:00,763
Ah, Polly.

305
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:04,643
Come to see my son.

306
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,803
Close the door.

307
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:13,913
I've just been conducting...

308
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,513
an interrogation.

309
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,193
It can be awfully hard on the hands.

310
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:22,113
My son, Michael, where is he?

311
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:23,643
Do you think I need a shave?

312
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:28,433
It's been a long day.

313
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,363
I need to shave, don't you think?

314
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:35,563
Well, maybe it can wait till later.

315
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:42,833
Your son has been having a
hard time of it, I am told.

316
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,513
And that is why I thought that
you and I, together,

317
00:20:45,563 --> 00:20:48,963
we should do whatever
we can to get him freed.

318
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:53,953
I... I have a form here,
a release form,

319
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:59,523
and with my signature he can be
freed by tomorrow morning at dawn.

320
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:17,923
So sign it.

321
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:22,033
He didn't do anything.

322
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,833
"Sign it, Mr Campbell,
please, sir."

323
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:30,243
Something like that, that'd be
a way to say it, wouldn't it?

324
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,323
Now...

325
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:37,563
.. what would prompt me to
do you such a favour, hmm?

326
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,843
What do you want?

327
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,913
Information?

328
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:51,363
You mean inside information about
Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?

329
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:55,513
With respect,

330
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:58,953
I would say that I know more about
Tommy's dealings than you do.

331
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:01,993
He doesn't trouble the family with
Irish business, for instance,

332
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:04,553
does he? No.

333
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:07,353
So, no...

334
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:09,123
it's not information I need.

335
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:18,883
What else could you give me...

336
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,323
.. in return for my signature?

337
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:27,003
I'm talking about a
simple transaction here.

338
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:31,803
I have a great curiosity.

339
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,683
Like a magpie... sees something...

340
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:40,083
.. something shining in the mud.

341
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:45,243
Oh, he has no need for
the silver, but...

342
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,323
.. but he takes it anyway.

343
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:16,553
Sign the form.

344
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,113
"Please, sir..."

345
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,163
Please, sir...

346
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:27,713
I will sign that form
with this hand...

347
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:29,833
.. when I am finished.

348
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,633
It's a deal?

349
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:33,363
It's a deal.

350
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,153
You don't cry?

351
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:41,803
~ Oh, I can cry.
~ So...

352
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:44,603
.. that is what I want.

353
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,643
I need you to cry.

354
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:50,843
I will try.

355
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:59,793
"I need a favour, Mr Campbell,
sir. And I will do anything...

356
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:01,353
"Anything in return."

357
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,283
That's what you might have said, hmm?

358
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:08,843
I felt something when...

359
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:14,913
.. when I had you up against that car
and you felt it, too.

360
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:17,273
(Don't tell me you didn't, Polly.)

361
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:19,193
Because...

362
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:22,163
Oh, and now you think you're...

363
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:25,513
.. sort of respectable...

364
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:28,233
with your son and your house

365
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:31,153
and your maid,
but I know what you are,

366
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,323
you Gypsy Fenian slut.

367
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:38,203
Do you want it on the floor
or on the desk, Mr Campbell?

368
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:51,353
Now you cry.

369
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:53,203
You cry!

370
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:02,763
Get out. Get out.

371
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:06,473
Get out!

372
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,673
No. No!

373
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,993
I want him free.

374
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,003
I will get him free.

375
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,443
You don't need to shave.

376
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:22,043
You don't need to do anything.

377
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,953
Victory's just doing nothing,
as well.

378
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:30,803
Doing it soft and gentle.

379
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:41,603
Should I talk or not talk?

380
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:47,403
Should it be like
I am weak and small, yes?

381
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,923
Do you want me to talk or not talk?

382
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:57,433
Talk.

383
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,283
You're small and weak.

384
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:03,513
Then that is what I am -

385
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,283
small and weak.

386
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:08,443
Look.

387
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,563
Feel.

388
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:15,763
You made me cry.

389
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:22,353
No!

390
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:25,273
We had an agreement, right?

391
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:27,003
Yes. Yes!

392
00:26:29,523 --> 00:26:31,723
DOOR OPENS

393
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:38,953
Where've you been?

394
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:43,763
I went to the Spotted Dog in Digbeth
for a glass or two of rum.

395
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:48,153
Was it one glass or two?

396
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:50,473
It was three.

397
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:53,193
Where's the baby?

398
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:54,843
Sleeping.

399
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,043
More like five.

400
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:04,003
It was more like six.

401
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:09,153
Did you meet the maid?

402
00:27:09,203 --> 00:27:12,563
I talked politics with her
and she got bored and went to bed.

403
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,793
I phoned James.

404
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,113
He talked to the lawyer anyway.

405
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:24,803
He said he'd take Arthur's case
for free, so we don't need Tommy.

406
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:31,113
Pol?

407
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:33,753
We'll get Michael free, as well,
I promise.

408
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:36,923
There's no need, they're
letting him out in the morning.

409
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:45,393
If the baby wants anything at
night, ring the bell by the bed.

410
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:48,923
She gets paid to work 24 hours,
that girl, she's getting lazy.

411
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,363
Well...

412
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:56,163

00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:54,523
They told me what you did.

431
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:03,243
They thought it was funny.

432
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:11,963
Maybe it is.

433
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:39,043
What are you doing, Tommy?

434
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:42,923
Shovelling shit, Curly.
Just like you.

435
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,833
And why are you doing that, Tommy?

436
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,483
To remind myself of what I'd be
if I wasn't who I am.

437
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:29,153
Tommy?

438
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:30,753
What's going on?

439
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:33,083
I think Tommy's lost his mind,
Charlie!

440
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:39,593
Well, it's honest work, Curly...

441
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:42,673
but I don't want to get used to it,

442
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:45,433
so I'll need six cans of petrol.

443
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:49,283
Bring them to the garage,
put them in the back of the car.

444
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:52,363
Six cans?

445
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:56,883
Tommy, if you ever want a job,
I'll get you your own shovel.

446

She's not half-blind,
she's half-deaf.

458
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:07,233
So what time will you be back?

459
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:08,603
Before midnight.

460
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:12,283
I'll be awake.

461
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:09,713
Is this your house?

462
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:12,003
Yes. Have a seat.

463
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:25,473
Do I not get a drink?

464
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,003
Please.

465
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:33,393
~ You want one? ~ Yes.

466
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:34,563
Still whisky?

467
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:38,073
Yes.

468
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:39,753
But other things have changed.

469
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:41,833
I saw vans with your name on
at the docks.

470
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,683
Yes, some things have changed.

471
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:03,273
Tommy, I really wasn't sure
about coming tonight...

472
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:05,443
I lit a fire in the
bedroom upstairs.

473
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:11,673
My plan was that we sit here for
a while and...

474
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,673
talk about old times,

475
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:15,643
drink some whisky.

476
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:20,353
And I was going to tell you

477
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:23,513
I hadn't spent a day
without thinking about you.

478
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:25,713
And then we were going
to go upstairs

479
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:27,043
and sleep together.

480
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:32,353
But just now,
on the way to opening the door,

481
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:33,923
I changed my mind.

482
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:38,593
So just have one drink,

483
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:41,753
tell me how happy you are in
New York and then you can go.

484
00:35:41,803 --> 00:35:43,113
You "changed your mind"?

485
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,803
Mmm. So you can go.

486
00:35:50,723 --> 00:35:53,553
As a matter of fact,
I am happy in New York.

487
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:56,953
~ And I am married.
~ Oh, yeah, he's rich, I know.

488
00:35:57,003 --> 00:36:00,073
And he's sweet and he's kind to me,

489
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:03,273
so what makes you think that
I would have gone to bed with you

490
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,513
after one whisky and
some conversation?

491
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,553
~ I was accounting for three whiskies.
~ How dare you?

492
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:10,913
Doesn't matter now,
because I've changed my mind.

493
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,553
I came here because you asked me.

494
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,593
Even though he's sweet
and he's kind to you?

495
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:18,273
~ And now I feel like an idiot.
~ Well, then go.

496
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:19,923
(Jesus.)

497
00:36:31,243 --> 00:36:33,283
But you're still here.

498
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,753
Are you so certain?

499
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:40,723
That you're still in love with me?

500
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:45,683
I was, but I'm not any more.

501
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:52,473
You're not armed, Grace, are you?

502
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:54,953
No, I'm not armed.

503
00:36:55,003 --> 00:36:58,443
I don't carry guns.
I don't have to.

504
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:06,513
You don't have a
sense of humour any more, either.

505
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:08,363
What are you talking about?

506
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:22,073
Thing is, I hate reunions.

507
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,833
I didn't want to sit here for
hours talking about nothing

508
00:37:24,883 --> 00:37:27,483
and dancing around what
we really want to say.

509
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:30,873
So now...

510
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:33,433
I know you're happy in New York.
I know your husband's rich

511
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:36,913
and sweet and kind to you.
I know you're unarmed

512
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:41,833
and you didn't come here for sex,
because you don't love me any more.

513
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:45,713
And it's only three minutes past.

514
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,563
Another drink?

515
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:54,043
I'll take that as a yes.

516
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:58,123
It's good to see you, Grace.

517
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:01,923
So you didn't light the fire?

518
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,363
You see, my real plan...

519
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:12,003
.. was that we go out.

520
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:15,993
I want to impress you.

521
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,643
Now...

522
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:20,883
.. do you like Charlie Chaplin?

523
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:25,873
Yes, I like Charlie Chaplin.

524
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:27,793
Good.

525
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:30,643
But I bet you've never heard
Charlie Chaplin speak.

526
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:34,593
I thought you were taking me
to see Charlie Chaplin.

527
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:37,153
~ I am.
~ This isn't a picture house.

528
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:39,833
No, it's not a picture house.

529
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,913
So how will I see Charlie Chaplin?

530
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:46,033
You will see him and you will
hear him, just like I promised.

531
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:49,193
~ There you go, there's Chaplin.
~ Oh, my God, that's him. ~ Mm-hm.

532
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,793
~ That's really Charlie Chaplin
in person. ~ Yep.

533
00:38:51,843 --> 00:38:54,153
He's in England, promoting his film.

534
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:56,793
~ And how the hell do you know
Charlie Chaplin? ~ I don't,

535
00:38:56,843 --> 00:38:59,273
I know his bodyguard,
Wag MacDonald.

536
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:00,953
It's that chap there.

537
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:04,193
I was a bookie in Birmingham,
then he went to Los Angeles.

538
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:07,393
You see, Wag is also a
Romany Gypsy, as is Chaplin.

539
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:09,313
But he keeps it a secret.

540
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:13,193
Chaplin was born on the Black Patch,
a Gypsy camp in Birmingham.

541
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:16,193
That's why he gave Wag the job,
even though Wag was on the run.

542
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:17,523
Thank you.

543
00:39:19,563 --> 00:39:21,113
Thank you.

544
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:23,513
See, we've all got secrets, Grace.

545
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:25,443
Come on, I'll introduce you.

546
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:32,233
Hello, Wag.
Mr Chaplin, this is Grace.

547
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:33,963
Hello, Mr Chaplin.

548
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:41,003
PHONE RINGS

549
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,633
~ Hello. ~ Hello, Mr Campbell.

550
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:48,513
You said you knew my sister's
address in Primrose Hill.

551
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:50,873
So I expect you have men
watching the house,

552
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:53,193
to see who comes and goes.

553
00:39:53,243 --> 00:39:55,953
Well, tonight, your men will see
me return to the house

554
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:57,833
with a very beautiful woman.

555
00:39:57,883 --> 00:40:01,073
She will stay until
just before midnight.

556
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:03,123
Course, I'll close the curtains.

557
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,523
Can you guess who the woman is?

558
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:10,713
Liar!

559
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,523
Sleep well, Mr Campbell.

560
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:23,523
Tommy.

561
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:27,163
Tommy, do you have someone?

562
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:38,193
(It's too late, Tommy.)

563
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:40,113
(It's 11, Grace.)

564
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:42,123
I mean, it's too late.

565
00:40:44,723 --> 00:40:47,913
If you'd come with me to New York...

566
00:40:47,963 --> 00:40:49,483
I had things to do.

567
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,793
You mean the coin landed
the wrong way?

568
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:57,003
It couldn't have worked.

569
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:00,763
That was a question.

570
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:15,523
(Tommy, do you have someone?)

571
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,923
(I have a race horse.)

572
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,833
She's going to win the Derby.

When do you sail back?

587
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:30,523
We don't know yet.

588
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:34,243
You don't have a return ticket?

589
00:42:35,283 --> 00:42:36,923
This wasn't right, Tommy.

590
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:39,883
When do you go back, Grace?

591
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,113
They're doing tests on us.

592
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,243
I don't
know when they'll be finished.

593
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:55,683
We're having treatment.

594
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:58,443
A doctor in Harley Street.

595
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:01,523
Some new thing. A breakthrough.

596
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:06,523
We're trying for a baby.

597
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:32,883
Why did you come here tonight?

598
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:42,323
The doctor believes it's surely me
who's at fault.

599
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:53,403
~ I am sorry. It is no-one's fault.
~ I'm tired of that.

600
00:44:05,803 --> 00:44:06,923
Can I see you again?

601
00:44:11,323 --> 00:44:12,403
Grace?

602
00:44:17,643 --> 00:44:19,603
You're used to working under
cover, eh?

603
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:24,163
I've never lied to him once.

604
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:28,763
So tell him the truth.

605
00:44:48,763 --> 00:44:49,803
Put your arms up.

606
00:44:58,683 --> 00:45:00,203
What have we got here then?

607
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:06,883
Take your fucking hands off me!

608
00:45:08,483 --> 00:45:11,723
Here he is. The King of London Town.

609
00:45:21,883 --> 00:45:23,353
You been enjoying yourself?

610
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:25,633
Oh, yes, fucking great.

611
00:45:25,683 --> 00:45:27,433
Surrounded by Sabini's men.

612
00:45:27,483 --> 00:45:29,243
Rats everywhere.

613
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:31,523
Fucking cockneys.

614
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:35,753
Well, at least you're going to get
what you've always wanted.

615
00:45:35,803 --> 00:45:38,873
~ And what's that?
~ You've tried to hang yourself twice.

616
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:41,003
Now the King's going to
do it for you.

617
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,723
~ I've been a fucking idiot. ~ Yeah.

618
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:50,513
I haven't appreciated nothing, John.

619
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:52,633
Are you fucking repenting or
something?

620
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:53,723
Drawing.

621
00:45:54,803 --> 00:45:56,393
I used to be good at drawing.

622
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:58,753
Arthur, please. For God's sake.
I don't need this.

623
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,473
I should have listened
more in class...

624
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:02,923
What fucking class?
You were never there!

625
00:46:04,363 --> 00:46:05,993
I used to draw horses.

626
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,113
Arthur...

627
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:10,673
Stallions. Great big ones.
They looked real.

628
00:46:10,723 --> 00:46:12,603
Arthur. Not stallions, not now.

629
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:17,513
I should have done more
with my life, John. Good things.

630
00:46:17,563 --> 00:46:20,193
~ Arthur, for God's sake...
~ Even Ada said it wasn't my fault.

631
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:22,753
~ Arthur, will you listen?
~ They are going to hang me, John.

632
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:24,193
They're not going to hang you.

633
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:25,283
Says who?

634
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:28,523
Tommy.

635
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:35,393
And how is Houdini going to get me
out of this?

636
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:37,643
~ Well...
~ Don't tell me. He's got a plan.

637
00:46:38,643 --> 00:46:41,393
~ But you don't know what that
plan is, do you, John? ~ I do...

638
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:44,113
Because we just, we can't be
trusted.

639
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:48,753
All right. If he's
so fucking clever, why am I in here?

640
00:46:48,803 --> 00:46:52,753
~ Well... ~ Why is all our men and half
our whisky being lifted?

641
00:46:52,803 --> 00:46:54,193
Hmm?

642
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:56,393
The Jew and the cockney have run
rings round him.

643
00:46:56,443 --> 00:46:58,753
~ Will you shut up? ~ Look at you. Look.

644
00:46:58,803 --> 00:47:00,193
A big fucking man...

645
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:01,483
Fucking shut up!

646
00:47:04,723 --> 00:47:06,843
He's already
told me what I've got to do.

647
00:47:24,763 --> 00:47:26,953
What business have you got here?

648
00:47:27,003 --> 00:47:30,273
I just pulled over.
I never smoke and drive, you know.

649
00:47:30,323 --> 00:47:31,833
Where are you from?

650
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:33,553
I'm from Ireland.

651
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:36,033
The beautiful north, where the
rocks sing in the wind.

652
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,433
Where in the beautiful north?

653
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,393
You know, I just pulled
over for a fag.

654
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:41,393
I want to see some identification.

655
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:43,123

665
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,363
Does it really stop the horses
from getting worms?

666
00:48:39,403 --> 00:48:40,563
Yep. It really does.

667
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:48,203
Anyway, I thought it would
make you smile.

668
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:52,393
I'm sorry that
you had to drive through the night.

669
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:54,683
Must be exhausted. You can
go and sleep if you want.

670
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:57,763
May?

671
00:49:00,123 --> 00:49:01,163
We have to stop.

672
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:03,283
This.

673
00:49:04,843 --> 00:49:06,643
I came here to tell you
we have to stop.

674
00:49:09,563 --> 00:49:10,603
Why?

675
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:14,163
Because I'm me and you're you?
That old thing?

676
00:49:15,603 --> 00:49:16,803
There's someone.

677
00:49:19,763 --> 00:49:20,803
For a long time.

678
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,753
And I didn't want you to think
anything about how it's going to be

679
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:29,843
after the race.

680
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,043
HE CLEARS THROAT

681
00:49:35,323 --> 00:49:37,353
Not many of your people
know about me

682
00:49:37,403 --> 00:49:39,753
so I haven't done the damage
that would come.

683
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:40,843
"My people"?

684
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:47,683
~ But the damage isn't done,
is what I mean. ~ Right.

685
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,513
And even if it's like this,
I want the horse to stay here.

686
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:56,233
To stay. Yes, of course.

687
00:49:56,283 --> 00:49:57,433
Epsom is close.

688
00:49:57,483 --> 00:49:59,603
I haven't got my outfit yet,
so it's all right.

689
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,953
You can still be with me
in the enclosure.

690
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:04,873
Very gracious of you, Sir(!)

691
00:50:04,923 --> 00:50:06,313
You can wear something...

692
00:50:06,363 --> 00:50:07,353
It's funny, isn't it,

693
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:11,673
because you'll be up there
and I'll be down in the ring.

694
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:13,443
Sort of upside down, isn't it?

695
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:17,553
You can still be with me after
and you can still wear something.

696
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,563
I will be covered in mud,
from the ring.

697
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:24,033
May, forget about men like me.

698
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:26,563
I was going to tell you how much
she's improved.

699
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:33,513
There are other men who...

700
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,793
I think she stands
a chance of placing. So...

701
00:50:35,843 --> 00:50:37,593
So the silly
part of our business is done.

702
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:40,243
Are you going to drive
straight off to Birmingham, or...?

703
00:50:46,203 --> 00:50:50,153
What if I said, er, "All right, I'll
stay"?

704
00:50:50,203 --> 00:50:51,723
After what I just said.

705
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,403
Then that would be all right.

706
00:51:05,123 --> 00:51:07,553
You talk about "damage".
The damage not yet done.

707
00:51:07,603 --> 00:51:09,833
You don't think half of London
already thinks

708
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:11,403
that I am fucking a racketeer?

709
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:16,043
Laughing about it. Laying bets on
when you'll steal the silver.

710
00:51:18,323 --> 00:51:20,643
You think your people are ruthless?
Try mine.

711
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,713
So that is why you carry on, eh?

712
00:51:27,763 --> 00:51:29,403
Because you can't back down.

713
00:51:31,403 --> 00:51:34,163
Amongst many other illogical
reasons.

714
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:40,393
So will you drive straight off, or?

715
00:51:40,443 --> 00:51:42,603
I haven't got any
petrol in the garage.

716
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:48,953
I have some
cans of petrol in the car.

717
00:51:49,003 --> 00:51:50,403
Good. So you can go.

718
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,843
They look happy in there, eh?

719
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:24,843
And why wouldn't they be?

720
00:52:38,443 --> 00:52:39,483
Who is she?

721
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:43,483
Someone who's sailing away.

722
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:54,243
So let her sail.

723
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,913
You've told me about her. Like a
gentleman.

724
00:52:59,963 --> 00:53:01,723
Now kindly behave
like a gangster again.

725
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,723
Feel sorry for me. It's fine.

726
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:21,723
Because your horse will come
fifth or sixth.

727
00:53:23,963 --> 00:53:25,163
But I will win you.

728
00:53:33,363 --> 00:53:35,353
Mr Shelby is just parking his car.

729
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:37,243
He said for you to wait in here.

730
00:53:42,723 --> 00:53:44,243
Isn't this is impressive?

731
00:53:45,363 --> 00:53:48,003
And what is it you exactly do here?

732
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,193
I exactly am a secretary to
Mr Shelby.

733
00:53:53,243 --> 00:53:56,753
A secretary! My, my, my!

734
00:53:56,803 --> 00:53:58,283
All that paperwork.

735
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:02,553
Do you want tea?

736
00:54:02,603 --> 00:54:03,643
No.

737
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:53,163
I keep everything locked up,
Mr Campbell. Everything of value.

738
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,233
Take a seat.

739
00:55:03,283 --> 00:55:04,363
HE CLEARS THROAT

740
00:55:08,323 --> 00:55:10,603
How is your company treasurer, Polly?

741
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,193
Why do you ask?

742
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:17,083
Oh. Just give her my regards.

743
00:55:20,763 --> 00:55:22,083
Ah!

744
00:55:27,963 --> 00:55:32,083
You like to play with fire, don't
you, Mr Shelby?

745
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:35,833
Yesterday,

746
00:55:35,883 --> 00:55:37,553
in Belgravia,

747
00:55:37,603 --> 00:55:41,033
Field Marshall Russell's house was
burnt out.

748
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:44,073
An incendiary device was put
through his letter box.

749
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:45,163
Which means

750
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,993
that he will have to find somewhere
else to live

751
00:55:49,043 --> 00:55:51,043
for at least the next three months.

752
00:55:53,203 --> 00:55:57,353
Which also means that your plan for
me to break in and shoot him

753
00:55:57,403 --> 00:56:00,393
in his bed is no longer
an operational possibility.

754
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:05,553
Indeed, but if you think a wee burn
frees you from your obligations,

755
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:06,713
think again...

756
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,193
I will keep my side of the bargain.

757
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:10,313
Oh, by God, you will.

758
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:11,753
I will shoot your Field Marshal.

759
00:56:11,803 --> 00:56:14,553
But I will do it in a way that
serves my purpose.

760
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:16,673
The only purpose is MY purpose.

761
00:56:16,723 --> 00:56:19,883
I will carry out the assassination
at a place of my choosing.

762
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:22,883
Listen to me.

763
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:27,033
All operational
detail must be mutually agreed.

764
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,473
I am a soldier of experience and
I will determine where and when...

765
00:56:30,523 --> 00:56:33,393
Now, that man has 24-hour
armed police protection.

766
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:35,513
Your plan was full of holes,
Mr Campbell.

767
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:36,993
My plan was mutually agreed!

768
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:39,393
And now your plan is up in smoke!

769
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:41,993
And I have formulated the only
viable alternative.

770
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:44,163
For God's sake. What do you mean?

771
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:47,283
How would you get to him?

772
00:56:49,963 --> 00:56:51,673
I won't.

773
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:53,083
He'll come to me.

774
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,953
Now listen to me, Mr Shelby.

775
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:01,073
When this meeting is concluded

776
00:57:01,123 --> 00:57:05,113
I must report directly to
Mr Winston Churchill.

777
00:57:05,163 --> 00:57:09,513
Your relationship with
Mr Churchill is not my concern.

778
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:14,193
And Mr Winston Churchill
will need to hear details.

779
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:16,803
Well, you tell him
he'll have to trust me.

780
00:57:21,443 --> 00:57:25,123
Look, Mr Campbell, I will
carry out my mission.

781
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:31,313
~ Good. Good. ~ But I will do it in a
place where it will be impossible

782
00:57:31,363 --> 00:57:34,803
for you or your men to have me
shot afterwards.

783
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:40,513
Because that was your plan, eh?

784
00:57:40,563 --> 00:57:42,713
Coppers front and back. No way out.

785
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:45,353
Me shot dead, dumped in the Thames.

786
00:57:45,403 --> 00:57:47,353
I will do the killing,

787
00:57:47,403 --> 00:57:49,803
but in a place where that will
not be an option.

788
00:57:52,243 --> 00:57:55,923
I have recently become
a racehorse owner, Mr Campbell.

789
00:58:00,843 --> 00:58:01,883
It's, er...

790
00:58:03,643 --> 00:58:06,193
Well, perhaps you can guess which
one is my horse.

791
00:58:06,243 --> 00:58:07,523
HE COUGHS

792
00:58:24,483 --> 00:58:26,283
Where and when?

793
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:29,443
Epsom.

794
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:32,003
Derby day.
