1
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:04,329
The pro-treaty paddies and the king
want the same man dead.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,729
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby.

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,889
The Epsom Derby, Pol. We'll be
drinking with the bloody king.

4
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:12,009
For the last ten years,
Sabini's made it his race.

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,529
If we're going to take him down,
might as well make it there.

6
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,209
~ It's good to see you, Grace.
~ Tommy, do you have someone?

7
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:19,569
Your horse will come fifth or sixth.

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,649
But I will win you.

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,369
Mr Churchill was impressed.

10
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,249
He has asked that the
Colonial Office grant him

11
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:27,569
an Empire export licence.

12
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:30,249
I want my son out of prison. Now.

13
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,209
He can be freed by tomorrow morning.

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,489
I'm talking about a simple
transaction here.

15
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:37,889
I will carry out the assassination
at a place of my choosing...

16
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,129
Epsom.

17
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,219
Derby Day.

18
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,139
'My name is Thomas Shelby.

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,139
'And today, I'm going to kill a man.

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,819
'Today is Derby Day...

21
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,579
'.. and the murder will take place
this afternoon at the Epsom races...

22
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,409
'It may be that I am able
to escape after the killing.

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,089
'The odds are not good.

24
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:12,529
'Which is why I'm writing
this letter.

25
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:16,009

crown to carry out this murder

~ Small Heath Rifles! ~ Let's go.

guilty of other things...

to me today...

Don't ask any questions.
It's... to do with insurance.

Look, Tommy?

involved in, just tell us.

six o'clock in the morning?

hell's going on?

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,649
~ Little errand. ~ What errand?

71
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,449
~ He just has to stand there, Ada...
~ Stand where?

72
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:19,209
~ Let's go... Come on.
~ James, what's going on?

73
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,289
Don't listen to him, James,
he'll get you killed!

74
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,409
What errand?

75
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,689
For the cause, Ada.

76

I trust you. That is that.

127

No, no, no, no.

134
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:13,059

up for us, just in case.

Don't worry about it, right.
Cos it is totally legal, binding.

140

143
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,249
Yeah.

144

145
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,019

146
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,699

Yeah!

148
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,459

No. No. Ollie, no. Put that down.

151

He understands. He understands.

152
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:09,929

Now, look, it's just
non-fucking-negotiable.

154
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,489
That is all you need to know,

155
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:16,809
so all you have to do is sign
the fucking contract.

156
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,449
~ Right there. ~ Just sign here.

157
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:21,129
~ With your pen. ~ I understand.

158
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,889
Good. Get on with it.

159
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:25,099
I have an associate waiting
for me at the door.

160
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,449
I know, he looks like a choirboy

161
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:32,169
but he is actually an anarchist

162
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,169
~ from Kentish Town. ~ Tommy,

163
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:38,049
I am going to fucking
shoot you. Right?

164
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,529
Now, when I came in here,
Mr Solomons,

165
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:43,089
I stopped to tie my shoelace...

166
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,449
Isn't that a fact, Ollie?

167
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:47,729
I stopped to tie my shoelace.

168
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,569
And while I was doing it,

169
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:52,489
I laid a hand grenade under
one of your barrels.

170
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:55,369
A mark 15 with wire trip.

171
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,809
My friend upstairs is like one of
those anarchists

172
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:02,249
that blew up Wall Street, you know?

173
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,339
He's a professional.
And he's in charge of the wire.

174
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,609
If I don't walk out of that
door by the stroke of seven,

175
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,729
he's going to trigger the grenade

176
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,969
and your very combustible rum

177
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,819
will blow us all to hell.

178
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,499
And I don't care...

179
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,619
.. cos I am already dead.

180
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:36,169
He tied his lace, Alfie.
And there is a kid at the door.

181
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,049
From a good family, too. Ollie,
it is shocking what they become.

182
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,649
What were you doing
when this happened?

183
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,209
He tied his lace. Nothing else.

184
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,049
Yeah. But what were you doing?

185
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:46,819
Marking the runners in the paper.

186
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,609
What are you doing?

187
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,779
Just checking the time. Carry on.

188
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,849
Ollie, I want you to go outside

189
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:58,889
and shoot that boy in the face
from the good family.

190
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:02,579
Anyone walks through that door
except me, he blows the grenade.

191
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,339
~ He tied his fucking lace, Alfie.
~ I did tie my lace.

192
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,899
I bet hundred to one...

193
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,289
.. that you're fucking lying, mate.

194
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,489
~ That's my money. ~ Well, you see, you
have failed to consider the form.

195
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,739
I did blow up my own pub
for the insurance.

196
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,009
OK, right, well,
considering the form,

197
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,929
I would say, 65 to one.

198
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,609
Very good odds. And I would be
more than happy and agree

199
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:38,689
for you to sign over 65%
of your business to me.

200
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,329
~ Thank you. ~ 65? No deal.
Ollie, what do you say?

201
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,889
Jesus Christ, Alfie,
He tied his fucking lace. I saw him.

202
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,409
Look, he planted a grenade.
I know he did.

203
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,339
Alfie, it is Tommy fucking Shelby.

204
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:56,329
You are behaving
like a fucking child.

205
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,899
This is a man's world.

206
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,859
Now, get that apron off and sit
in the corner like a little boy.

207
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,059
Fuck off. Now!

208
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,969
~ Four minutes.
~ Right, four minutes.

209
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,729
Talk to me about hand grenades.

210
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,129
The chalk mark on the barrel at knee
height said, "Hamilton Christmas".

211
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,339
I took out the pin
and put it on the wire.

212
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:43,259
Based on this...

213
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,329
.. 45%.

214
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,889
30.

215
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,419
Aw, fuck off, Tommy.
That's far too little.

216
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:02,459
In France, Mr Solomons, when I was
a tunneller. A clay kicker. A 179.

217
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:06,139
I blew up Schwaben Hohe.

218
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,859
Same kit I'm using today.

219
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,059
Funny that.

220
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:17,889
I do know the 179

221
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:21,769
and I heard they all got buried.

222
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,649
Three of us dug ourselves out.

223
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,939
Like you're digging
yourself out now.

224
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,779
Like I'm digging now.

225
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,059
(Fuck me!)

226
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:40,579
Listen, I'll give you 35%.
That's your lot.

227
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,459
35.

228
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,499
~ You're late. ~ I had business.

229
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,969
How the fuck did you get me
out of that?

230
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,929
I need you today, brother.

231
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,219
~ And pulled some strings.
You all right? ~ I am now.

232
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,249
So, Arthur's back in charge now?

233
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:25,249
He's in charge of you and you're
both in charge of him.

234
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,409
~ Look-out duties only today.
~ Tommy, I'm getting sick of this...

235
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,979
Finn, you don't obey orders,
you don't come.

236
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,249
~ Johnny Dogs. ~ Tommy?

237
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,299
~ Your boys will meet us there?
~ The Lees will be there, Captain.

238
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:40,769
"Captain"?

239
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,129
Aye, we promoted you.

240
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,009
Well, the boys decided you're no
longer like a Sergeant Major.

241
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,569
Fucking those rich women
and using those fancy words.

242
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,609
I'd say you're more
like a captain these days.

243
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,899
Fine, well, I'll take
it as a compliment.

244
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:57,489
Just don't bloody shoot me.
Let's go to the Derby, boys.

245
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:59,739
Right then, load them up.

246
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,169
Hello?

247
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,379
No, I'm afraid Mr Shelby
is in London.

248
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,619
He can't be reached.
No, he won't be back today.

249
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,379
He's at the races.
The Epsom races. The Epsom Derby.

250
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:22,819
Can I ask who's calling?

251
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,339
I'm going to the station.

252
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,379
~ What's that? ~ That money's yours.

253
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,049
You take the money,

254
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:16,209
you get a train
and you start a new life

255
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,459
in London. I don't want to see
you here when I get back.

256
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:25,619
If I get back.

257
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,099
Everything's an "if"
in this Birmingham life.

258
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,849
You can write on Sundays.

259
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,329
And visit on Holy Days.

260
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,859
But I want you to wash this city
out your hair and your clothes.

261
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,889
It is what I should have
done at the start.

262
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,579
Now, I've got business to attend to.

263
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:54,819
I do love you, Michael.

264
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:58,099
I love you, too.

265
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,619
You'll miss your train.

266
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,219
My beloved greyhounds...

267
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:52,539
.. behold today's rabbit.

268
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,899
When I give you the signal, I want
you to send that man to his maker.

269
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,009
I decided to use you men,

270
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,569
because I couldn't trust the hearts
and the livers

271
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,299
of the English pansies and posies
they've given me as operatives.

272
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,139
Now...

273
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,219
.. this is a man of some
capability...

274
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,689
.. but I expect no excuses
and no failures.

275
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:27,409
The Red Right Hand of the
Ulster Volunteer Force

276
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,379
will not let you down, Mr Campbell.

277
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,819
The Red Right Hand.

278
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,169
Good luck, gentlemen.

279
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,129
♪ They're whispering his name

280
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,769
♪ Through this disappearing land

281
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:44,529
♪ But hidden in his coat

282
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,939
♪ Is a red right hand. ♪

283
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,449
Gentlemen, today we are not
fucking about.

284
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:01,249
I hope you've all obeyed instructions
and brought loaded firearms with you.

285
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:02,969
~ Yes.
~ Very good.

286
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,889
You all know that if you are lifted
on a race track these days

287
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,049
with a loaded weapon,
you get 20 years.

288
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,729
That's all right.
Today, you won't get lifted.

289
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,169
Because today, there'll be no
coppers around to lift you.

290
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,609
At exactly three o'clock,

291
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:17,449
there will be an incident
in the owner's enclosure.

292
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:20,729
And all the coppers on the track
will be diverted. All of them.

293
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,329
They'll be looking for someone.

294
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,889
~ So, you'll be free to operate at
will. ~ Looking for who?

295
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,889
Me. They'll be looking for me.

296
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,729
Now, while the coppers
are busy with me,

297
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,729
you will make your move on
Sabini's pitches.

298
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,129
You confiscate his takings,
you destroy his licences

299
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,249
and you do it at gunpoint.

300
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,329
He usually has police protection,
so they won't be armed.

301
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:40,129
We should aim to complete the take
over without a shot being fired.

302
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,329
Understood?

303
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,489
And remember, the licences are more
important than the takings.

304
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,329
All right. Before the fun begins, you
can all lay ten bob on Nom De Guerre.

305
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:53,249
I hear she's going to win.

306
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,009
Only beer beforehand, boys.

307
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,409
There'll be plenty of time
for rum and whisky after.

308
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:02,849
And remember, do not make a move
until three, when the coppers leave.

309
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,009
~ That is all. ~ Feeling lucky, John.

310
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,329
Incidents...
What are you going to do

311
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:11,809
that's going to make every copper
at the Derby look the other way?

312
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,529
Trust me, brother!

313
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,379
Over here. Over here.
Are you ready, boys?

314
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,099
Ten, please.

315
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,579
It's right here, mate.

316
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,739
She threw a shoe coming
out of the box.

317
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,129
She looks in fine shape.

318
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,049
Hello, hello, hello.

319
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,779
~ Should I be worried?
~ You should not.

320
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,449
Go and drink. Enjoy the day.

321
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,339
I'll come and find you
when the race is done.

322
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,729
That's nice, is that yours?

323
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:35,889
My mother wore it to
the Derby in 1895.

324
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:37,809
She was presented to Queen Victoria.

325
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,049
After the race,

326
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,289
I'll change in the horse box

327
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,769
and then come and join you up there
with the toffs. What do you say?

328
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:46,659
Hm... yeah.

329
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,979
You don't want me to join you.

330
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,619
It's fine. I'll stay
down here in the mud.

331
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,489
Whatever happens today,

332
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,819
it was good.

333
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,019
You mean win or lose?

334
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,699
Yeah. Win or lose.

335
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,689
You know I never watch the race.
I can't stand it.

336
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,539
I always like to find
somewhere dark and quiet...

337
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,419
Tommy?

338
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,969
If you can't find me up there,

339
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:42,899
I'll come and find you later.

340
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,249
What do you mean?

341
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:51,049
Whatever happens, May, no regrets.

342
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:52,539
No regrets.

343
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,339
And I will find you.

344
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,449
Right.

345
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,129
Remember that.

346
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,219
Bye.

Fucking meatball bollocks.

356
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,859
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,409
I have to talk to you....

358
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:45,689
~ Grace. What are you doing here?
~ I have to talk to you.

359
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:49,739
Grace... this is not a good time.

360
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:56,739
This way. Excuse us.

361
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,249
Whatever it is, Grace,
it'll have to wait.

362
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,859
It can't wait.
It wasn't me who was at fault.

363
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,419
I'm pregnant.

364
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,459
The baby's yours.

365
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,849
But he'll believe... Make your
husband believe that it's his.

366
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,489
Is that what you want me to do?

367
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,289
Grace, I seriously have things to do.

368
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:27,049
~ It's not even worth the toss
of a coin this time. ~ Grace.

369
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,649
I have things to do. When they are...

370
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,809
When they are done, I will decide.

371
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:33,649
~ And when will that be?
~ After the race.

372
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,409
After the race?
After the fucking race, Tommy?

373
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,689
When the race is over,
I will decide what to do.

374
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,219
~ What to fucking do. All right?
~ But, Tommy...

375
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:45,609
I was right not to tell him.

376
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,609
I could have phoned him
and lied, but I didn't.

377
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,249
Just tell me I was right
not to phone and lie.

378
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,179
Agree with that, Tommy.

379
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,089
Yes. Yes, Grace.

380
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:00,539
Because the thing is...

381
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,979
.. I love you, not him.

382
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:09,739
That is a thing.

383
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,259
~ A baby, Thomas. ~ Yes.

384
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:24,009
Go to your race.

385
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,379
~ Where will you be? ~ I'll be waiting.

386
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:29,979
I'll wait where they lay their bets.

387
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,649
Found a lost sheep.

388
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:08,739
Come on, Lizzie.

389
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:14,329
~ What do you think? ~ About what?

390
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,659
~ About the dress?
~ Undo two buttons. Come on!

391
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:27,059
~ Oh, Tommy, I never thought
I'd see the like of this. ~ Yeah.

392
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:30,089
But I do know that I'm here to work.

393
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,689
~ So you may have noticed
I haven't taken a drink. ~ Here.

394
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,219
Take this. You might need it.

395
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:45,449
What's the work you want me
to do here today, Tommy?

396
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,289
Taking notes on a meeting?

397
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:50,289
No, Lizzie. You're not
here to take notes.

398
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,139
My shorthand won't be required.

399
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:54,779
Lizzie...

400
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:01,049
.. there's a man here.

401
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:04,409
And I need him to be separated from
the crowd and taken to a quiet place.

402
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,089
"A quiet place"?

403
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:08,299
~ Lizzie, I know what I said.
~ Yeah, you know.

404
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:12,089
You know you told me I shouldn't
do that kind of work any more.

405
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:14,409
I just need you to
isolate him is all.

406
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,569
No exceptions, you said.

407
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,219
I have drawn a map, all right?

408
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:21,729
Of where exactly
you need to take him.

409
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,489
For months, I made no exceptions,

410
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:26,369
~ Because you told me not to.
~ Lizzie...

411
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,569
just keep him busy at the
place marked with an X

412
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,179
and I'll get to you before
he can start, I promise. All right?

413
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,249
Mustn't smudge my eyes.
He might not like that.

414
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,449
Lizzie, this is the only time.

415
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:43,329
And after this, never again.

416
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:45,369
All right, I'll pay you
an extra five...

417
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,249
DO NOT talk to me about money now.

418
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,899
Not right now or I swear
I'll break this glass in your eyes.

419
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:57,409
"No exceptions"
has been no hardship.

420
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,579
You know why?

421
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,379
Hmm?

422
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:07,539
Doesn't matter.

423
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:11,929
~ Who is he? ~ To your right.

424
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:13,019
Soldier.

425
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,209
Smoking a cigarette.

426
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,049
Just be alone with him at three
when the race starts.

427
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,649
I'll do the rest. Yeah?

428
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:24,009
~ Got a piece of chalk? ~ Chalk?

429
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,209
It's how the soldiers know.
It doesn't matter.

430
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:28,099
Just give me the fucking chalk!

431
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:41,809
Lizzie, it is going
to be all right, eh?

432
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:45,249
I'll get to you, I promise,
before it can start.

433
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,339
I will be there.

434
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,969
Keep them fucking guns ready.

435
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:04,339
~ Keep them guns ready.
~ He's here, boss.

436
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:13,299
The coppers aren't moving. They're
stood there like fucking gargoyles.

437
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,619
Keep your wits about you, boys,
all right?!

438
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,489
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the race will begin in four minutes.

439
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,739
'Please make your way track side...'

440
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:21,019
Shouldn't you be busy?

441
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:26,659
When you plan something well
there's no need to rush.

442
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:32,219
You know something?
I actually trust you to do this.

443
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:41,049
Do you think there might
be some measure of respect

444
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,449
developing between us?

445
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:45,209
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the runners and riders

446
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:48,329
'are coming to order.
Please take your seats...'

447
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:51,299
Old foes who have grown
to admire each other?

448
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,139
And see each other's
professional virtues.

449
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,729
Personally... I think not.

450
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:03,259
I think not.

451
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,499
Well, I'll drink to that.

452
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:13,889
'Ladies and gentlemen, please be
upstanding for the national anthem.'

453
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,689
So, is the plan that you'll stay
together for ever?

454
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:28,249
Or perhaps she'll whore for you
and take her husband's money.

455
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,899
Is that the plan?

456
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,219
How wrong I was about her?

457
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,339
I was wrong about her, as well.

458
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:47,219
You once said to me,
that men like us can never be loved.

459
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:53,299
But she loves me. She told me.

460
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,539
She loves me.

461
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,539
And all you got was a bullet
and a fucking wolf head cane.

462
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,579
Well, bully for you.

463
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:13,259
This I know...

464
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:17,089
Ahead of you is damnation.

465
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:22,009
But I have the love of God
and the certainty of salvation.

466
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,499
I know what you did to Polly.

467
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:43,259
I know what happened
to Michael in jail.

468
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,889
Today, it will be me dead or you.

469
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:56,419
But whoever it is,
they'll wake up in hell tomorrow.

470
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:03,209
'Ladies and gentlemen,

471
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:06,219
'the runners and riders
are under starter's orders.'

472
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,419
'And they're off!'

473
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,219
Come on, girl. Come on.

474
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,299
At least make a showing.

475
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,179
Come on, Tommy.

476
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,059
What a pretty dress.

477
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:19,089
Take it off.

478
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:21,249
Shall we take this off first,
shall we?

479
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:25,179
~ Lift up your dress and show me
that you're clean. ~ Oh!

480
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,179
Do as you're told!

481
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:34,339
We should take it slow.
We've got all the time.

482
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:42,889
This area is closed off.

483
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:45,209
~ What? ~ The king will be coming this
way after the race.

484
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:48,019
This area is secured.
You'll have to go round.

485
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:05,809
Get the fuck off! Fuck off.

486
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:06,979
Get the fuck off me!

487
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,179
Oi!

488
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,769
RUSSELL!

489
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,099
Fuck!

490
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,849
Lizzie?

491
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:22,129
Where were you?
Where the fuck were you?

492
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,369
Give me the gun, Lizzie.

493
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:26,169
Lizzie. I'm sorry.

494
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,409
Fuck off! Fuck off!

495
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:31,539
Lizzie, just go. Go on. GO!

496
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:45,689
Officers...

497
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:49,409
Officers, I was taking a shit
and I heard voices, Irish voices.

498
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:50,769
Then I heard a shot.

499
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:53,299
I swear to God, there's
a soldier lying dead in there.

500
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,289
Get every man in uniform
around the king!

501
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,449
Every man in uniform
around the king!

502
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:02,579
Right now.

503
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:05,539
The IRA are on the course.

504
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:09,819
Everyone to the king!
The Royal Enclosure now!

505
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:14,529
All right, make ready, boys,
this is it.

506
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,529
Right, you four get round the back.

507
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,289
You take three of your boys...

508
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,409
Scudboat, come on... Show them guns.

509
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:22,489
Right, you come with us
and you stay back.

510
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:23,859
Let's go!

511
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:28,379
Put your hands in the air.

512
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,419
Turn around!

513
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:39,849
Is there a problem?

514
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:42,289
There are Fenians on the course.
A soldier's been shot.

515
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:44,649
Someone said there was
an Irishman in here.

516
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,059
That was correct.

517
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:52,899
Very sorry, sir.

518
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,779
Shadow Security to His Majesty.

519
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,289
I will now take
command of the situation.

520
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,259
MUSIC: Come On Over by Royal Blood

521
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:45,139
Mr Sabini, you're late.
Have a seat.

522
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:53,969
What happened to your nose?

523
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,089
You want to have that
brother of yours put down.

524
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:57,649
I tried that. He bit the vet.

525
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:02,409
I told the coppers that
you're a fucking Gypsy racketeer

526
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,369
Peaky Blinder and they're coming,

527
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:07,409
they are going to throw you
out before the king comes up here.

528
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:11,859
Well, from what I saw,
the police are a bit busy right now.

529
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:15,299
Did you win any money today,
Mr Sabini?

530
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,339
Where are our coppers?

531
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:24,169
I said to that sergeant one minute,
he said two,

532
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,849
and it's fucking ten.

533
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:27,939
Like I told you, they're a bit busy.

534
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:30,009
Same as my boys.

535
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,409
~ What the fuck does that mean?
~ What does that mean?

536
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:36,489
Well, my boys are on the track
having a little bonfire.

537
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,539
Gaming licences, you know.

538
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:46,219
Fuck...

539
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,889
You placed too much reliance
on the police

540
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:52,819
for your security, Mr Sabini.

541
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,299
That was a mistake.

542
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,769
No, no. Think about who you are.

543
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:01,449
Think about where you are.

544
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:04,409
You pull a weapon,
you are the king's assassin.

545
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,499
Sit down and stay calm.

546
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,489
Good.

547
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:16,929
Now, your next mistake, Mr Sabini,

548
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:20,899
was breaking your promise
with Alfie Solomons.

549
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:27,219
You promised Alfie that his bookies
could come to Epsom.

550
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,579
He was very hurt when you said no.
He was very hurt.

551
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:37,859
And that is why me
and Alfie are back in business.

552
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,659
Police! All right!

553
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:58,299
It's all right, officers,
he's just a bad loser.

554
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:06,539
You fucking lose, you fucking
Gypsy bastard!! You lose!

555
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,809
What the fuck are you looking at?!

556
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,739
Step back! Move!

557
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,859
You are now a prisoner of
the Red Right Hand.

558
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:29,379
Now, take his hat and gun.
Get him up.

559
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:32,099
Easy...

560
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:36,929
Take a seat.

561
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:49,379
Now, you make
yourself nice and comfortable.

562
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:53,579
We're just going for a wee
drive, Mr Shelby.

563
00:42:56,819 --> 00:42:58,179
Let's go.

564
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:35,339
I guessed
and then John confirmed it.

565
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:39,259
Guessed what? Who are you?

566
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:44,659
I'm May Carleton.
I trained Tommy Shelby's horse.

567
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:48,339
And you're the woman who
he said was going to sail away.

568
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:54,539
I see he didn't tell you about me.

569
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:59,649
He did tell me about you.
I wonder if that's significant.

570
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:02,049
Tell me what about you?

571
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:03,979
You have any idea where he is?

572
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,099
I'm waiting for him here.

573
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:18,049
There's been trouble on the track.

574
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:20,769
All the bookies
have had their licences burned.

575
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,689
Shouldn't you be down with
the horses...

576
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:25,809
Which means they will have to
re-apply for their legal pitches.

577
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:28,489
It's all part of Tommy's
plan for the future.

578
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,369
What do you know about Tommy's
future?

579
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:32,489
The applications will be
denied, of course.

580
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:35,779
And all the pitches will be
allocated instead to Tommy's
bookies.

581
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:40,939
I know because I'll make sure of it.

582
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,659
I have influence with the board.

583
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:50,689
There's business and there's love.

584
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:52,259
Is there?

585
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,779
With Thomas Shelby?

586
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:00,409
What do you want from him?

587
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,139
The same as you.

588
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:06,139
I want to feel alive.

589
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:18,659
Did he tell you my name?

590
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:26,099
My name is Grace.

591
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:37,809
In your statement to the House, sir,
I believe that you should say

592
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,889
that witnesses heard the killers
say that they were

593
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,449
members of the IRA
and that the killing

594
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:49,099
was in retribution for actions of
the Field Marshal in County Cork.

595
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:55,369
Oh... Our friend from Birmingham?

596
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,019
He has been taken care of.

597
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:02,129
Oh... A very good day, sir.

598
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,449
Thank...

599
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:09,579
Oh... Sorry, I must go. Goodbye.

600
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:14,779
Polly.

601
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,459
Tommy told me you'd be here.

602
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:28,129
And I told Tommy it should be me
who finishes you.

603
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:37,409
Small and weak.
That's how you like it, isn't it?

604
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:40,699
Well, this time small
and weak has got a gun.

605
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:45,489
You wouldn't do that here.

606
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,009
No?

607
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,489
Do you see any coppers? I don't.

608
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:54,819
They're all around
your precious king.

609
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,779
Polly. Polly...

610
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,209
~ Some part of you...
~ I have no parts.

611
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:21,849
Some part of you wanted me, as well.
I know that.

612
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:22,939
I felt it.

613
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:28,539
And sure as hell some part of me
wants you still.

614
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:32,539
Not just that part.

615
00:47:33,779 --> 00:47:35,219
Some part of my soul.

616
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,729
Some part of my soul.

617
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:41,169
Curious how that is to me...

618
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:43,139
And curious that it should be you.

619
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,259
Opposites, perhaps.

620
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:56,369
Opposites. And that... that thing
sticking in my heart you own.

621
00:47:56,419 --> 00:48:00,249
You own part of that heart.
You do. You do, Polly.

622
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:01,419
You do.

623
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,499

Lizzie. What the fuck
are you doing here?

635
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,369
Working for Tommy.
Same as all of us.

636
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:38,929
You work for the Blinders?

00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:50,419
Come here... Were you working?

642
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,089
Yeah? Thought you'd earn yourself
a few bob at the races, eh?

643
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:58,249
This has got to stop, Lizzie.

644
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,449
It's got to stop.
Tommy has already told you.

645
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,449
The toffs at the races
are the worst. You know that.

646
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:08,209
Come here, come here.
Look at me...

647
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:10,369
Cheer up. We won.

648
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:13,289
We fucking took Epsom!

649
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:16,089
We kicked the Cockneys'
fucking arses.

Congratu-fucking-lations.

651
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:19,729

I don't see the same thing
in your eyes that I see in Tommy's.

656
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:35,249
You should get out.

657
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:37,179
You should get out.

You know how it is.

676
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:22,219
I know how it is.

677
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,649

And one of us
bet you'd still be here.
