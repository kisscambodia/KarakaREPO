1
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:06,013
A vacancy has appeared and you're
going to fill it.

2
00:00:06,063 --> 00:00:09,013
From now on, Mr Shelby,
you shut your Gypsy mouth

3
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:11,013
and listen to your instructions.

4
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:15,013
I know it was you who carried
out the murder of Mr Duggan.

5
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:20,373
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:22,893
 Name?  Harold Hancox.

7
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:25,093
 Have you ever been arrested?
 No.

8
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:27,453
Arthur, we can stand him up.

9
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:30,333
'Last night, one of our men had
his throat cut in Winson Green.'

10
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:31,933
I'm not real!

11
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:36,053
'Gentlemen? This is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.'

12
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,613
 I want to go with them.
 Over my dead body.

13
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,013
Do we hear 800 guineas? 850.

14
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:43,813
'May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.'

15
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:46,773
 So will you consider me?
 I will consider you.

16
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:48,413
Thomas Shelby?

17
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,813
'Did they behave themselves?'

18
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:56,223
They were really amazing.

00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:35,173

00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:50,853
You might think this is a curious
place for me to suggest a meeting,

30
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:52,893
but...

31
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:55,543
your surprises have
only just begun.

32
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:09,413
You look a little unsteady,
Mr Shelby.

33
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,103
Take a seat.

34
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,263
You're working together.

35
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:23,063
Blowing up the Garrison
was your idea.

36
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:26,383
You who chose me.

37
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:33,093
It's funny, I thought the
Fenians had a policy...

38
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:36,173
 Enough.  .. of not mixing the
personal with the political.

39
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:39,093
 I said enough.  I think
I will decide on what is enough.

40
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:41,733
Who's in charge here then, eh?
Who's in charge?

41
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,333
Right, let me understand this.

42
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:47,173
 You answer to an agent of the Crown.
 Perhaps we can just...

43
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:50,133
 Very interesting.
 Perhaps we can stick to the agenda.

44
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:52,653
 Whose agenda?
 There is a form of words here.

45
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:54,583
 Whose words?  Arrogant bastard.

46
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:59,293
 I'm not accustomed to being spoken
to like that.  Just come to order

47
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:01,653
I am here to listen,
but not to the fucking infantry.

48
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:03,973
Enough! Jesus!

49
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:05,463
Now...

50
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:11,253
.. some weeks ago, Mr Shelby
carried out a military mission

51
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:15,213
on behalf of pro-treaty Republicans
here in Birmingham.

52
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:16,533
You...

53
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,413
working for the King.

54
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:21,813
 There is a unique political
situation.  Yeah? How does that feel?

55
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:24,413
 Let us...  Tell me.
How does that fucking feel?

56
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:25,773
.. stick to the form of words.

57
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,933
 Temporarily, we have a
shared interest.  Oh, I see.

58
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:31,573
 Shall we just stop him laughing?
 You want me to stop laughing?

59
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:35,013
 Explain this, pal.  Following
the success of your mission...

60
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:37,853
 We're going to make you do it again.
 Will you shut up?

61
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,293
Can we just conduct
ourselves here, please?

62
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,893
 Conduct ourselves!  Please.

63
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:45,583
No-one in this room wants to breathe
the same air as anyone else.

64
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:51,053
 Nevertheless...  Nevertheless
the pro-treaty Paddies

65
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:53,143
and the King want the same man dead.

66
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:56,503
Am I right?

67
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:22,653
 Why him?
 Did you ask why in France?

68
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:26,903
 Yeah.  So, it's the same answer -
because.

69
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:36,213
Why me?

70
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:38,583
 Because.  Because.

71
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,613
Because if anybody
connects me to this,

72
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,973
it will be assumed
that it was a criminal act

73
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:47,853
and not a political one.

74
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,533
No, you need not fear being
connected to the killing

75
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,453
because I will see to it that
no connection is ever made.

76
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:58,933
You will have complete
immunity after the fact.

77
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:03,253
But, in the execution, you will get
no help from agents of the Crown.

78
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:05,263
And we can't be seen to be involved.

79
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:10,253
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby,

80
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,093
and there really is no choice.

81
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:14,453
No equals bang,

82
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:17,263
and your man here will shed no tears
as he looks the other way.

83
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:25,533
Nevertheless...

84
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,383
I say no.

85
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:35,663
Mr Shelby?

86
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:44,293
What about your export licence,
Mr Shelby?

87
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,783
You had a deal with Mr Churchill.

88
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:55,173
The one with the mouth,
Donal Henry, he is a spy.

89
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:58,333
He is working for the Irregulars
against the pro-treaty Paddies.

90
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,613
He reports every fucking
word back to them.

91
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:01,893
No, it's not possible.

92
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:04,733
They've both been security vetted
by my own department.

93
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,373
I have men in places
your men can't go.

94
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:10,173
Donal Henry meets the
anti-treaty Paddies in the back room

95
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:13,583
of the Mother Red Cap in
Saltley sometimes twice a week.

96
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:17,533
These Irish enemies are
fucking brothers and cousins.

97
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,423
You are stepping into a world
you don't understand.

98
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:27,933
If what you're saying is true,
he'll be dealt with.

99
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:32,543
Bring me proof the spy is dead
and we have a deal.

100
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,183
 Mr Shelby.  Billy boy.
 Watch it.

101
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,223
Now on you go.

102
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,783
Right, boys, let's go!

103
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:33,253
Fuck you!

104
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:35,143
Mario!

105
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:38,223
Mario!

106
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,773
Mario!

107
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,823
Come here.

108
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,463
Sabini's day is done.

109
00:09:57,943 --> 00:09:59,623
I'll protect you now.

110
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,133
Oh, shut up!

111
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:06,423
Stop fucking whingeing.

112
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,493
Due to my razor blade

113
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,653
and a few complaints
from the neighbours

114
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:17,263
about the terrible fucking music...

115
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,813
Do you want to
tell them or should I?

116
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:29,423
This place is under new
management...

117
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:38,653
.. by order of the Peaky Blinders.

118
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,103
Yes?

119
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:30,053
Somebody to see you, Mr Shelby.

120
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:32,973
He says he's come about the
position of accounts clerk.

121
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:34,703
Send him in.

122
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,863
 Just through here, sir.  Thank you.

123
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,023
Michael...

124
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,063
.. vacancy's been filled.

125
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,183
Not according to this morning's
paper.

126
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,613
At school, I was top of the
class in mathematics

127
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,413
and I did a night-school course in
accountancy at Worcester College.

128
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:12,973
Mum says you've had
six different accountant clerks

129
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:14,343
in the last six months.

130
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:20,063
When respectable men see the
other things you do, they leave.

131
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:25,583
But I, like Lizzie out there,
already know what you do.

132
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:31,293
Mum says you want to be 80% legal
within two years.

133
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,173
 Three.
 I can help.

134
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:40,093
I know both sides and
you know you can trust me.

135
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:45,103
I want to help you, Tommy,
become legal.

136
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,343
Do the right thing.

137
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:53,983
I want to be proud of this family.

138
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,863
Does Polly know you're here,
Michael?

139
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,783
I'm 18 on Friday -
I go where I please.

140
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,463
You phone your mother.

141
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:30,063
Good luck.

142
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:41,333
We're not open for winnings yet.

143
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,183
I'm here to see Thomas Shelby.

144
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:50,333
I have an appointment.

145
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:52,023
Come in.

146
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:07,613
 May Carleton.  Mr Shelby
has his proper meetings

147
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:09,623
in his other office.

148
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,933
This was the address
that he gave me.

149
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:17,613
 He gave you THIS address?
 He said it was a gambling den.

150
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:19,653
I told him that
I've wanted to see one

151
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,013
since I'm always reading
about them in the papers.

152
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:24,933
Quite the big scandal
in the Telegraph lately.

153
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,943
Anyway, he said that
I could come and have a look.

154
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,453
And now I feel like a bit of an idiot

155
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:35,173
because I'm early and he's late
and I have no idea how to behave.

156
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:36,583
In a gambling den?

157
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:41,613
I'll wait in the car.

158
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:45,533
If I open the door again,
they'll all want to come in...

159
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,263
like flies.

160
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:53,063
So what are you?

161
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:55,893
W-what am I?

162
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,423
To Thomas?

163
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:02,503
I'm going to train his
racehorse... for Epsom.

164
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:05,063
You know horses?

165
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,973
Yes. You?

166
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:10,303
Born riding.

167
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,463
I slept in a manger when I was a
baby.

168
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,213
I was born riding, too.

169
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:24,373
There's a fucking
great Riley parked out there

170
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:25,733
and nobody's watching it.

171
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:29,863
John, this woman says
she's training Thomas' horse.

172
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,023
He's told us a lot about you.

173
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:38,733
Don't know where he is, do you?

174
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:45,093
Sorry I'm late.
There was a family matter.

175
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:47,333
Esme, keep it locked
up for a minute.

176
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,983
 Yes, Thomas.
 I'll show you around.

177
00:16:57,943 --> 00:17:00,983
So... be my guest.

178
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,263
That's my brother Arthur's office.

179
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:20,093
Down there is
my brother John's office -

180
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:22,743
that's where we slate
the runners and riders.

181
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:28,423
It's so out in the open.
What about the police?

182
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:31,223
What about them?

183
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:34,893
When I drove into Small Heath,

184
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:36,933
I thought I was going to get
murdered...

185
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,983
then I mentioned your name.

186
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:42,783
It was like being escorted
to see a king.

187
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:48,583
 You came here to get my girl, right?
 Right.

188
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,733
She looks in very good condition,

189
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:08,133
considering she's not been
out on the gallops.

190
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:10,093
Curly's the best horseman
in England.

191
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:12,733
I have a man called Mickey
who'd argue the point.

192
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:15,293
Ah, but Curly here is
half horse himself.

193
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:17,533
She's blessed. Very blessed.

194
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,493
Well, she's from the best stock.

195
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:22,653
But I'd rather have a coloured pony.
Mixed blood is stronger.

196
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,293
Not to win the Derby, Curly.

197
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:26,813
Don't like them racing, Tommy,
not the way they beat them.

198
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:29,583
 She's all yours.
 Thank you.

199
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:35,573
He gets sad when one leaves.

200
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:38,933
 What time is your box van coming?
 Midday.

201
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:41,893
Maybe you've got time to take
the lady to the Garrison,

202
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:44,263
show her the spa and
the tearooms.

203
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:48,703
I'd like that, why not?

204
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,133
I just had it done up.
There was a fire.

205
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,733
It's...

206
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:02,253
Yeah.

207
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:03,783
What do you drink?

208
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,783
So early, but gin.

209
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,543
Goodness. With something?

210
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,663
Like what?

211
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:32,543
Tonic water or...

212
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:38,583
Erm... we have... cordial.

213
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:42,743
There's not much room
in there but...

214
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,663
You want to fuck me, Mrs Carleton?

215
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,413
Perhaps because I...

216
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:03,143
Perhaps because I represent
something to you?

217
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,373
We should have this conversation
before the booze

218
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,063
starts talking for us.

219
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:14,983
You have a horse.

220
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,253
Yes, I have a horse.

221
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:23,253
The horse is why I'm here...

222
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:25,173
purely that.

223
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,493
And because you're paying me a
lot of money to train your horse,

224
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,373
that's why I'm here,

225
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,703
purely that.

226
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,343
Good.

227
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:41,173
Good. Well, a toast, then.

228
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,103
To the horse, to the Derby.

229
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:48,863
 Cheers.  Cheers.

230
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:56,103
So is that what you say to women?

231
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,733
Only if I don't know what they want.

232
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:03,823
And what if they don't want to fuck?

233
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,413
Then life is simpler.

234
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,023
You want a simple life?

235
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:15,583
Do I look like a man
who wants a simple life, eh?

236
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:18,423
So what do you want?

237
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,773
For what I'm paying you,
Mrs Carleton,

238
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:27,743
I want a horse that'll pay out
at Epsom on an each-way bet.

239
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:36,853
Before I took your account,

240
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:38,903
I did some credit checks on you.

241
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:43,423
Apparently, you don't exist.

242
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:50,903
My existence is questionable.

243
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,503
Gypsies don't like registers.

244
00:21:56,863 --> 00:22:00,813
You see, I'm not a Gypsy
like you mean.

245
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:02,783
But you did register for France.

246
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:07,293
I also sent your name
to the War Office -

247
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:09,613
I have friends there.

248
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,903
You won two medals for gallantry.

249
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:17,383
Does that really impress you,
Mrs Carleton?

250
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,263
Call me May.

251
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:33,333
Charlie says the box van is here.

252
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:34,943
Thank you, Finn.

253
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:41,823
You know, I still don't know what
you're going to call your horse.

254
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:46,663
The horse will be called
Grace's Secret.

255
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:50,743
Grace's Secret.

256
00:22:56,783 --> 00:22:59,663
I told him he definitely
can't take the job.

257
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,853
He said "All right,
I'll move to London, then."

258
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:07,743
I said, "I won't give
in to blackmail. No is no."

259
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:13,533
Well... that settles it, then.

260
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,373
I'll give the job
to the other candidate.

261
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:18,413
He's much better qualified anyway.

262
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:22,253
Michael did City And Guilds -
six months.

263
00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:25,293
Yeah, but he doesn't
know racing, Poll.

264
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:28,813
He knows horses,
but he doesn't know racing.

265
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:31,053
This other boy, he knows racing.

266
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:32,983
He's good. He's a fast learner.

267
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:38,423
What if Michael really leaves?

268
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,973
You just got to let him go, Poll.

269
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:44,693
He'll get a job in
an office in London.

270
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:47,173
I'm sure he'll write to you.

271
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:48,813
He made a big speech

272
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:53,253
about wanting to help you
build up a respectable business.

273
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:55,493
Oh, he's like his dad,
he could make me cry.

274
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:58,093
There are trains to London.

275
00:23:58,143 --> 00:24:00,413
So I just let him leave?

276
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:02,343
Every month or so he'd be back...

277
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,893
.. unless of course he meets a girl.

278
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,783
Then, who knows?

279
00:24:13,143 --> 00:24:16,373
Oh, my God.

280
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:18,093
You want him to do this job.

281
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:21,143
Polly, I want what you want.

282
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:26,653
What about this other more
qualified candidate?

283
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:29,093
Mmm...

284
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:31,343
Well, I lied, there isn't one.

285
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:37,303
How much are you paying?

286
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:41,693
 The advertised rate.
 Like hell.

287
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:43,703
 Three bob.  Like hell.

288
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,853
 Three and six.  Four.

289
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,423
Four it is.

290
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:57,533
 I love him, Tom.
 I know.

291
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,733
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

292
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:03,183
put him charge of the new. Agreed?

293
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:05,903
Agreed.

294
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:18,613
Well, Finn, you've got two choices -
mild or mild.

295
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:21,173
 Mild.  There you go.

296
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:23,743
Here he is, look.

297
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:29,533
Happy birthday, Michael.

298
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,493
18 years old. You're a man today.

299
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:35,613
 Give him a drink, John Boy.
 There you go, lad.  And after that,

300
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:37,773
we'll go to find you
a lady of the night.

301
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,023
Arthur!

302
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:44,853
Michael.

303
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:46,773
What's that?

304
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:48,783
So you're never late for work.

305
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,493
Welcome to the business, Michael.

306
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:58,213
 Welcome to the business.  Thank you.

307
00:25:58,263 --> 00:26:00,973
Right, come on,
let's get him drunk. Come here, you.

308
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:02,253
All right, whisky.

309
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:06,413
No whisky, he's at work tomorrow.
Give him only dark mild.

310
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:09,373
 A toast.  Toast.  To Michael.

311
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:11,023
To Michael.

312
00:26:28,263 --> 00:26:29,903
Are you all right?

313
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:40,693
 What is it? Just us?  Just us.

314
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:42,223
Are we celebrating?

315
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,263
Just taste this.

316
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:01,853
What do you think, Arthur?

317
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:05,333
Yeah, it's good.
Good stuff, really nice.

318
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:07,093
Too good for the Garrison.

319
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:10,503
I suppose we could shift it
to the toffs at the Eden Club.

320
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,533
Why? What is it?

321
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,343
That is part of an export drive.

322
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:19,853
We now have a secure warehouse
in Camden Town

323
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:22,853
and secure passage to the
Poplar Docks.

324
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,773
So, on Monday morning,

325
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:27,453
we'll be sending out
our first export crate.

326
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:31,173
A crate of Riley car spares...

327
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:34,053
bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

328
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,903
Where there's prohibition.

329
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:40,133
Where there is prohibition.

330
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:41,813
All over Canada and America,

331
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:45,573
people are making their own booze
in bathtubs.

332
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:50,453
But rich people in New York,
in Toronto and Boston

333
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,573
are still paying a lot of
money for the real stuff.

334
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:57,813
So, on Monday, the first
Shelby company crate

335
00:27:57,863 --> 00:28:00,813
will contain a thousand
Riley carburettors.

336
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:04,933
But hidden in the packing
will be 500 bottles

337
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:09,743
of the finest quality
single malt Scotch whisky.

338
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:14,413
And we, Shelby's, have a licence

339
00:28:14,463 --> 00:28:17,213
granted by the
Minister Of The Empire himself,

340
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,853
which means our crates
won't be searched.

341
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:22,893
And, Polly, all of the whisky
will be packed at the docks,

342
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:26,733
so Michael can do the books
without being involved.

343
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:30,333
Like I've been telling
you all for a year now...

344
00:28:30,383 --> 00:28:31,823
motor cars are the future.

345
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:38,693
So, how is your life then, Tom?

346
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:41,413
On the up, Johnny, on the up.

347
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:44,973
But, Tom, really, come on,
how is it?

348
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,133
You know I hate to
see you not even married yet.

349
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:51,773
I have a fine looking cousin,
she'll make your life hell.

350
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,213
You deserve her!

351
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:58,543
We haven't had a good old
wedding in a long time.

352
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:03,453
Have you had a look inside
these boxes, then, Johnny?

353
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:06,013
What do I want to look
at car parts, Tommy,

354
00:29:06,063 --> 00:29:07,743
when I haven't even got a car?

355
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:13,053
Faith in family's a fine thing, eh?

356
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:16,013
And I wouldn't even be counting.

357
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,933
25 becomes 24, then 24 it is.

358
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:22,893
Oh, you know I'm no good
with numbers, Tom.

359
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:27,013
And if 24 ever became 23...

360
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,613
then that'd be tax.

361
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:31,733
We don't pay tax.

362
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,303
No, Tom.

363
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:36,783
Good man.

364
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:48,213
I put an iron door on,

365
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:51,173
and we've put iron bars on the
windows and across the skylights.

366
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:55,093
 Good.  So what will you be
keeping in here, Tommy?

367
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,743
Temptation, Billy. Temptation.

368
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,823
Morning, Arthur. I was just passing.

369
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:21,373
I think I'm in fucking love.

370
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:23,423
Drink!

371
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:30,743
She don't know where to look.

372
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:33,583
Whisky, Tommy?

373
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,493
No, I've got a long drive ahead.

374
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,013
You off home?

375
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:41,773
Mm-hmmm. Eventually.

376
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,143
To Birmingham.

377
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:50,063
What's this?

378
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,413
Olives.

379
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:55,063
Yes, it's miscellaneous.

380
00:30:56,263 --> 00:30:58,453
It's, erm, olives.

381
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:02,583
Sticks, you know, with little bits
of fucking onion and things.

382
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,063
That's what that is.

383
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,263
We've taken 600 pounds on olives.

384
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:13,623
Yeah, with little bits of onion.

385
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:22,503
I told you, Arthur...

386
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:28,893
.. the dealers sell the cocaine,
we take a cut.

387
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:31,093
We don't sell direct.

388
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:32,973
The Home Secretary's cracking down

389
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,093
and I don't want this...

390
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,743
.. to fuck up everything else,
you understand?

391
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:41,013
I understand.

392
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:43,583
How much of that 600
came out of your pocket?

393
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:53,253
It's under control.

394
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:56,343
I put you down here cos people
are scared of you, Arthur.

395
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,223
But if you don't straighten up,
it'll be John's turn in London.

396
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:05,373
No need.

397
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,743
I can handle it.

398
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,783
It's under control?

399
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:12,383
It's under control.

400
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,303
Fucking tidy profit, though, eh?

401
00:32:28,223 --> 00:32:29,703
It's happening, Tom.

402
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:33,983
Good.

403
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:36,223
Good.

404
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,183
Straighten up, soldier.

405
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:57,823
Yes, sir, Sergeant Major.

406
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:28,303
What's your business?

407
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:32,143
Sorry, I'm, er, I'm lost here.

408
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:36,943
 Yeah, well, you can't stop here.
Move on.  All right.

409
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:48,583
23 seconds.

410
00:33:58,023 --> 00:34:00,223
It's all right, Ada,
it'll be Andrew for me.

411
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:05,383
Oh.

412
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,213
I'm looking for Ada.

413
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,623
Who are you?

414
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:18,773
Ada.

415
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,533
I asked you a question.

416
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,493
It's all right, James.

417
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:24,733
This is my brother.

418
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:26,053
Who's he?

419
00:34:26,103 --> 00:34:27,453
He rents a room.

420
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:29,293
You need to rent out rooms?

421
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:31,173
Actually, she doesn't charge rent.

422
00:34:31,223 --> 00:34:34,103
He's a writer,
which means he's skint.

423
00:34:36,623 --> 00:34:38,293
You get up late these days, Ada.

424
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,413
Mm. I go to bed late.

425
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:42,013
Yeah? Where's Karl?

426
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,623
What do you want, Tommy?

427
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:48,773
Oh, God, before you start
sizing him up for a wedding suit,

428
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:50,493
he's not interested in me...

429
00:34:50,543 --> 00:34:53,053
 or in girls of any kind.
 Ada!

430
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,453
What? Tommy won't judge you.

431
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:56,783
He sure as hell
won't go to the police.

432
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:00,253
Look, I'll go and get dressed.

433
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:02,013
James...

434
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,773
I'm Thomas.

435
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:05,503
Pleased to meet you.

436
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,463
Can I have a minute
with my sister, please?

437
00:35:13,063 --> 00:35:14,463
Yes, of course.

438
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:25,373
So, does your lodger know your name?

439
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,133
Yeah. Thorne.

440
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:30,093
You think I'd tell anybody
anything else?

441
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:33,333
Your Brummie boys
are all over the papers.

442
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:36,093
Just one last push, eh?
Then you'll go legit?

443
00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:39,773
Just one more obstacle to get round
then it'll all be straight?

444
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:41,253
Actually, yes.

445
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:44,733
Personally, I find it quite amusing.

446
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:47,853
Men like you are becoming
very fashionable down here.

447
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:51,093
No society party in London
is complete without a gangster

448
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:52,783
for the girls to go giddy for.

449
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:57,223
Anyway, what is it that you want?

450
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,663
I don't have any children, Ada...

451
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:05,943
.. so I have set up a trust fund.

452
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:10,743
The beneficiaries
will be John's kids and Karl.

453
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:16,063
In order for Karl to benefit,
I need your signature.

454
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:20,813
I've...

455
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:22,533
set up an account.

456
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:26,703
Money will be transferred
in the event of my death.

457
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:31,063
It'll set them up for a new life.

458
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,093
Are you sick?

459
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:42,853
I'm just doing
what any ordinary man would,

460
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:44,383
putting my affairs in order.

461
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:16,773
'Did you know they was
going to take the Eden club?

462
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:19,573
'I know about the Eden club, yes.'

463
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:22,093
Did you know they were going
to do it before they did it?

464
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,813
Because that's the one
who's in charge, isn't it?

465
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:27,613
The one who knows before it happens.

466
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,733
I know what I know, you know.

467
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:34,653
If you don't know,
then you don't fucking know, do you?

468
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:38,253
Did you know they was going
to take Wimbledon dogs?

469
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,543
Harringay? The trotting tracks?

470
00:37:42,823 --> 00:37:47,253
Talk, all right?
I genuinely want to hear you.

471
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:48,653
You've lost control, Alfie.

472
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:50,053
Have I?

473
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,543
Everybody knows.

474
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:57,543
 Talk to me, Alfie.
 Talk to you?

475
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,573
All right, I'll talk to you. I'll
fucking tell you how it was, right?

476
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:03,103
What happened was this.

477
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:08,573
All the time you were talking about
dirty fucking Jews.

478
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:11,053
All the fucking time -
dirty fucking Jews, dirty Kikes,

479
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:14,493
 dirty dustbin lids...  Everyone makes
jokes.  You want to talk about

480
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:17,333
 not getting into places?
 Everybody makes fucking jokes.

481
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:19,773
I didn't know you had
no sense of humour!

482
00:38:19,823 --> 00:38:22,733
And I ain't going to FUCKING mention,
right,

483
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:27,103
the great big
fuck off elephant in the room.

484
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,013
Look, Alfie...

485
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:33,813
How many of my bookies
worked Epsom this last May?

486
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,613
None. None.

487
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:37,493
Not one.

488
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:41,413
So, for a few fucking jokes
and Epsom,

489
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:44,973
you fucking invite
a tribe of savages into the city

490
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,983
and just fucking
unlock the fucking gates!

491
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:55,653
I'm sorry, what are you saying, mate?

492
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:57,143
I'm saying...

493
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:01,023
I'm sorry about the Jew thing.

494
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:05,333
 Are you saying you're sorry?
 Yeah.

495
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:08,293
 You're sorry about the Jew thing?
 Yeah.

496
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:10,853
 Really?  Yeah.

497
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:13,703
I want that in writing. Write that
down. He said, "I'm sorry".

498
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:17,693
And also write down

499
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,413
that all our bookies
can go back to Epsom.

500
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:23,743
 He didn't say that.
 Who's asking you?  No.

501
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:26,413
Write it down.

502
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:28,853
It's all right. Come on.

503
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,383
Alfie's an old friend.

504
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:34,343
My friend.

505
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:37,773
Now, admit it,

506
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:41,453
the Peaky Blinders
is out of control.

507
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:43,853
Yeah, they're out
of fucking control, mate.

508
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:47,223
They come down the canal,
they spread like the fucking clap.

509
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:50,943
 Right. So now they're
everybody's problem.  Yeah.

510
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,613
 Alfie.  Mm.

511
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:57,653
 You and me, we've been fighting
since we was at school.  Yeah.

512
00:39:57,703 --> 00:40:01,933
 All right? Now, also,
we've been friends.  Mm, yeah.

513
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,583
You know, it goes
backwards and forwards.

514
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:08,133
How much better is it
when we're friends?

515
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:09,933
Oh, it's much better, mate, yeah.

516
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:11,663
You write that down.

517
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:15,253
So what we're doing here, right,

518
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:18,973
is we're writing down some
kind of a deal thing, right?

519
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:22,053
 Yeah, a written deal.
 Written deal, good.

520
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:26,933
Well, why don't we discuss
the border between the Italians

521
00:40:26,983 --> 00:40:29,653
and the Jews going back
to Farringdon Road.

522
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:32,293
 Farringdon Road...
 Yeah, Farringdon Road.  Fuck!

523
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:33,813
That's ancient history.

524
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:36,533
 Write down Farringdon Road.
 No, no, no, write down Camden Road.

525
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,293
 Farringdon Road.  Camden Road.

526
00:40:38,343 --> 00:40:40,653
 Write down Farringdon.  Camden.
 Farringdon.  Camden.

527
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:42,183
Write down Camden Road.

528
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:45,413
Just write down "peace".

529
00:40:45,463 --> 00:40:47,893
Just write down "peace", right,

530
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:51,983
between the Jews and the Italians.

531
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,253
And war...

532
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,183
against the gypsies.

533
00:41:21,383 --> 00:41:22,663
Fuck.

534
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:31,063
Mr Thomas Shelby, madam.

535
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,943
Nice house.

536
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:52,053
Would you like a whisky?

537
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:53,693
Scotch or Irish?

538
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:55,453
Irish.

539
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:03,933
Sorry for the short notice.

540
00:42:03,983 --> 00:42:05,623
I was... passing.

541
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:09,173
We're not quite
on the Birmingham road.

542
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:10,973
It was a small diversion.

543
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:13,533
60 miles - I checked.

544
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,503
That's a small diversion these days.

545
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:19,933
So, I'm a small diversion.

546
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:21,223
Good.

547
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:25,893
Your horse is still out
on the gallops,

548
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,653
but I had Mickey
prepare this report.

549
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:30,423
You can read it now if you'd like,
then we can go see her.

550
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:41,013
Is there enough light
for you to read?

551
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:42,343
Yes, it's fine.

552
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,383
It's getting quite late.

553
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:59,373
Mickey says she has
the lungs of an elephant.

554
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:01,173
She's nimble in the heavy going,

555
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:03,453
but bounces a little
on the hard ground.

556
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:05,383
Sorry, I'll let you read.

557
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:11,613
So, he thinks she'll favour
good to soft ground, eh?

558
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:14,573
 A little juice in the grass.  Mm.

559
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:16,423
Well, that's good for Epsom.

560
00:43:18,503 --> 00:43:21,103
Does he think she's
not good enough for Epsom?

561
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:24,453
She needs a lot of work.

562
00:43:24,503 --> 00:43:26,623
The race board will need convincing.

563
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,823
 I imagine you have some influence.
 Mm.

564
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:35,183
That's the suggested programme
for the next two months.

565
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:40,493
Your glass is empty.

566
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:42,023
It's fine.

567
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:45,623
Are you hungry?

568
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:49,413
Yes, a bit.

569
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,783
I can prepare something.

570
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:53,543
Do you have engine oil?

571
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:59,183
Before I set off for Birmingham,
the car needs oil.

572
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:03,413
I'm sure my husband
kept some in the garage.

573
00:44:03,463 --> 00:44:05,453
I can someone to do it.

574
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,343
This evening or tomorrow?

575
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:14,583
Well, we're so far from anywhere,
people usually stay over.

576
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:18,573
Especially before cars,
when it was just carriages,

577
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:20,743
people used to stay over
all the time.

578
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:23,463
But I have a car.

579
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:26,853
Yes.

580
00:44:26,903 --> 00:44:29,133
And you have...

581
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:30,743
engine oil.

582
00:44:32,023 --> 00:44:33,663
Probably.

583
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:37,743
But it would be very usual.

584
00:44:40,023 --> 00:44:41,463
What would?

585
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:44,293
For a guest to stay.

586
00:44:44,343 --> 00:44:46,893
We have a whole wing
called the guest wing.

587
00:44:46,943 --> 00:44:48,383
Oh, you...

588
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,263
You have a guest wing.

589
00:44:53,103 --> 00:44:54,623
Well...

590
00:45:02,423 --> 00:45:03,903
May.

591
00:45:13,383 --> 00:45:15,173
Have a smoke.

592
00:45:15,223 --> 00:45:16,863
Thank you.

593
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,943
Ignore this. It's actually all right.

594
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:32,623
I put all his photos
in a drawer and locked it...

595
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,463
.. as if that was going
to make a difference.

596
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:42,063
I'm like a fucking lighthouse
keeper...

597
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:47,423
.. out here on my own...

598
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:51,813
.. keeping his flame burning.

599
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:55,573
But, of course,
when anyone sees a lighthouse

600
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:57,703
they stay clear, don't they?

601
00:46:09,463 --> 00:46:10,983
Now, do you have a map?

602
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:16,863
Of the house. Do you have a map?

603
00:46:19,183 --> 00:46:23,263
Because I'm not going to be able
to find my way in the dark.

604
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:30,573
You see, at midnight,

605
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:33,493
I'm going to leave my wing

606
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:35,663
and I'm going to come find you.

607
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:40,533
And I'm going to turn the handle
of your bedroom door

608
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,573
without making a sound

609
00:46:42,623 --> 00:46:44,743
and none of the maids will know.

610
00:46:45,983 --> 00:46:47,423
You don't know maids.

611
00:46:50,103 --> 00:46:52,333
They hear a pin drop?

612
00:46:52,383 --> 00:46:56,173
If there's a man in the house,
they listen.

613
00:46:56,223 --> 00:46:57,663
They take turns.

614
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:00,543
So, let them listen.

615
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:09,693
Right. Day rate, seven shillings.
Loading, unloading.

616
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,943
Night rate, three. Total ten.

617
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,133
Let's go and get a drink.

618
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:16,533
No, I'm all right.

619
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,133
Come on, it's payday.

620
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:19,893
Everybody has a drink on payday.

621
00:47:19,943 --> 00:47:21,373
Not me.

622
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:24,373
You think your mum
don't have a drink on payday?

623
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:28,383
You think the Lord Almighty
don't have a drink on payday?

624
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:32,173
Man, it's on fire out there,

625
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:35,253
women from the BSA offices, honest.

626
00:47:35,303 --> 00:47:38,133
They go out on their own
without their men these days,

627
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:39,503
in twos and threes now.

628
00:47:40,863 --> 00:47:44,423
Mickey, they go out in twos and
threes and buy their own drinks.

629
00:47:49,543 --> 00:47:53,703
The Marquis, that's where the BSA
secretaries go.

630
00:47:57,743 --> 00:48:02,543
Look, they won't serve a black man
without a Shelby by his side.

631
00:48:07,703 --> 00:48:09,183
So you're using me?

632
00:48:12,383 --> 00:48:13,733
Yeah.

633
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:15,143
Come on.

634
00:48:22,823 --> 00:48:26,133
I told you, I fucking told you,
this city's gone mad.

635
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:27,823
Girls go out on their own now.

636
00:48:31,223 --> 00:48:33,093
Two pints of dark mild, please.

637
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,773
Fuck that. We're Peaky boys.

638
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:36,223
Two whiskies.

639
00:48:44,503 --> 00:48:46,823
You get used to it,
then you can't stop.

640
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,893
I don't drink with blacks.

641
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:57,533
Here we fucking go.

642
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,893
Paddy, they're OK.

643
00:48:59,943 --> 00:49:01,613
Not with me, they're not.

644
00:49:01,663 --> 00:49:03,653
I don't drink in pubs with blacks.

645
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:05,023
So leave.

646
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,613
Look, my dad
is the preacher round here.

647
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:10,933
He has connections, ask anybody.

648
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:13,493
I couldn't give a fuck who he is.

649
00:49:13,543 --> 00:49:15,333
I'm telling you to leave it, Paddy.

650
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:17,813
And I'm telling this darkie
to get out of here.

651
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:19,293
You know something? Fuck off.

652
00:49:19,343 --> 00:49:21,093
It's all right, Isaiah,
come on, leave it.

653
00:49:21,143 --> 00:49:23,423
 We'll go to my cousin's pub.
 I like it here.

654
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:26,903
You fucking nigger.

655
00:49:49,663 --> 00:49:51,773
Paddy!
The white kid's a Peaky Blinder!

656
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,623
He's Polly Shelby's son!

657
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,613
He's Polly Shelby's son!
Are you fucking suicidal?!

658
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,573
Sir...

659
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,293
Sir, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

660
00:50:02,343 --> 00:50:03,933
Get out!

661
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:05,373
Get out the fucking pub.

662
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:07,133
I really didn't know.

663
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:09,303
Fuck, let's go. Let's go!

664
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:13,613
We ordered some drinks

665
00:50:13,663 --> 00:50:15,623
and we're going to drink them.

666
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:29,133
His face, man.
Did you see his fucking face?

667
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:30,973
You punch like a fucking kangaroo.

668
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:33,983
I seen one once in a circus,
you punch like that.

669
00:50:35,063 --> 00:50:37,053
All right, anyway,
I need a fucking drink.

670
00:50:37,103 --> 00:50:39,853
 It's on you.
 It's on me? You just got paid.

671
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,303
Yeah, from you.

672
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,133
Fucking hell,
it's packed in here, isn't it?

673
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,853
So it's as easy as that?

674
00:50:53,903 --> 00:50:57,253
Easy as that, John boy.
London, you wouldn't believe it.

675
00:50:57,303 --> 00:50:59,253
Finn, stick your head in a bucket.

676
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:00,533
No.

677
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:03,293
The women, John boy, the women...

678
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:05,813
I've got this one,
she's a dancer, right?

679
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:07,663
She can do things with her...

680
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,213
If Finn would just piss off
I'd explain a little bit better.

681
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:16,773
Well, if it's so good,
why are you here?

682
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,653
A decent pint.

683
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:20,413
The cockney's can't get that right.

684
00:51:20,463 --> 00:51:22,943
He misses us, Finn,
that's what it is.

685
00:51:24,223 --> 00:51:27,423
Here they are, look,
junior Peaky boys.

686
00:51:30,823 --> 00:51:33,293
What's happened to you?
You been scrapping?

687
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,853
Some idiots at the Marquis of Lorne.

688
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:39,413
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

689
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,893
We fought them off.

690
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:43,573
Arthur, we had to stand
our ground and we did.

691
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:46,223
The Marquis, eh? Where's your dad?

692
00:51:47,423 --> 00:51:49,423
 Preaching.  Right.

693
00:51:52,903 --> 00:51:54,333
Don't nick any of me chips, Finn!

694
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:56,343
 Where are you going?
 We won't be long.

695
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:00,493
Where are they going?

696
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:01,783
The Marquis of Lorne.

697
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:04,493
Shame.

698
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:06,133
It was a nice pub.
