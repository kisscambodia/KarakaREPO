1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,418
What happened to the pub is
Irish business.

2
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:07,959
Shut your gypsy mouth 
and listen to your instructions.

3
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:10,527
Eamonn Duggan?

4
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:15,997
My son and my daughter were taken from me 
when they were very small.

5
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:19,477
We're planning an expansion.
I'm taking premises in London.

6
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,557
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs 
have been at war in London.

7
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:25,277
The Jews have had the worst of
it. They need allies.

8
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:27,247
We take the opportunity
to show our hand.

9
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:31,477
That arrived an hour ago.

10
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:34,037
There's no name on it,
but it comes from Camden Town.

11
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:37,477
Well done, Tommy.
Now you're at war with Sabini.

12
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:40,327
~ Ada Shelby? ~ No.
~ Your brother broke the rules.

13
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:43,607
Sabini.

14
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:46,527
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

15
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,487

alive.

We're Peaky Blinders.

My name is not Shelby!

27
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,647
Ready for a visitor, Mr Shelby?

28
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,917
No.

29
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:28,917
I'm here on the King's orders.

30
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:31,407
I'm afraid I must insist.

31
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:35,967
Ah, you paid extra for daylight.

32
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:40,917
The racketeering
business must be booming.

33
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:48,487
Are you not going to thank me
for saving your life?

34
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:54,207
Pass my cigarettes?

35
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,677
Three nights ago,

36
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:12,757
at the co-operative stables in
Montague Street,

37
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:14,797
there was a murder.

38
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:16,927
A man named Duggan.

39
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:23,887
The Oxfordshire constabulary
found his body in a shallow
grave.

40
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,767
I need to piss.

41
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:29,367
Nurse?

42
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:34,767
I know that it was you who
carried out the murder of
Mr Duggan.

43
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,127
Oh, by the way...

44
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,157
Grace, she went to New York.

45
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,567
A place called, er...

46
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,527
Poughkeepsie.

47
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,607
She's married now.

48
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:11,717
To a banker. He's rich.

49
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,407
I am sure she is very happy.

50
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:18,557
You have been under my
microscope for some weeks now.

51
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,317
I have been observing
every move you make.

52
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:24,847
That is why I was on hand
to save your life.

53
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,247
I imagine being shot by a woman

54
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,647
hurts the same as being shot
by a man.

55
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,367
Just a bit more shameful.

56
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:40,727
You know, Mr Campbell, when I
got shot they gave me a medal.

57
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:43,367
Yeah.

58
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:45,927
(No medal for you I bet.)

59
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,607
Mr Shelby...

60
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:52,487
our reunion...

61
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:57,597
..is part of a
very carefully worked out plan,

62
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,967
which has been in place
for some time now.

63
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,317
Every time you lean on that
stick I bet you see her face.

64
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:08,327
As a result of the information
in my possession,

65
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,197
I can charge you with murder
at any time

66
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:15,637
and provide two impeccable
crown witnesses

67
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:21,277
whose testimony will lead
you directly to the gallows.

68
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:25,677
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

69
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,607
And from this moment forward...

70
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:31,287
..you belong to me.

71
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,927
So, get well quickly.

72
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:41,277
I'll be in touch the moment I hear
you can piss standing up.

73
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:43,607
Then I will send
you your instructions.

74
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,877
Curly, you left the gate open?

75
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,837
No, I locked it.
I pinched myself when I did it.

76
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,487
Get this stuff under cover.

77
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:09,357
Hey!

78
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,447
Who goes there?

79
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:17,687
Tommy?

80
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:20,877
Curly, get that oil you put on the
legs when they go lame.

81
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,757
Are you fucking mad, Doyle?

82
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,127
The yellow stuff. Go on.

83
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,677
They said you'd be in for
another three weeks.

84
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,637
I need to get on a boat to London.

85
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:32,887
Tonight.

86
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:37,237
You discharged yourself?

87
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:40,557
I'm a fucking sitting
duck in there, Charlie.

88
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:42,877
Sabini could send a man at any time.

89
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,597
I need to get some things done.

90
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:45,767
You're burning up.

91
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:51,317
~ Here. ~ Oh, Tommy! That stuff's
for rubbing into fucking horses.

92
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,077
Ha! I am a horse.

93
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:57,397
If you were a horse, they'd shoot you
with this many broken bones.

94
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:01,717
Get the black powder, Curly.
Go. The black powder.

95
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:06,077
You pay for a bloody hospital
and you're using witchcraft?

96
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:09,317
I need to sleep in the open air and
feel the boat under me, Charlie.

97
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:13,597
Oh, Tommy.
You're just like your mother.

98
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,447
Do you have a boat here?

99
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:18,837
Only the January. She's heavy.

100
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,237
London will take four days.

101
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,487
That'll do. Can you spare Curly?

102
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,647
He'll be my doctor.

103
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:27,717
Then God help you.

104
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,437
You have tobacco, Curly?

105
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:33,077
And tea and whisky. We'll have
you running around like a colt.

106
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:36,157
Get him aboard. I'll fill her up.

107
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,157
If I sleep all the way, it's Camden
Town we're heading for.

108
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:41,637
What business do you
have in Camden Town, Tommy?

109
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:44,087
Tell Polly she's in charge
while I'm away.

110
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:48,927
If I don't come back,
tell her she's in charge for good.

You're a brave lad, ain't you? You

We bake the white bread,
we bake the brown bread.

144
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:55,527
We bake all sorts.
Would you like to try some?

145
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:02,517
Bread? Yeah?

146
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,877
All right.

147
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:06,917
What would you like, brown or white?

148
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,677
Try the brown.

149
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:11,287
Brown, right.

150
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:24,917
Not bad...

151
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:28,767
"Not bad," eh? "Not bad."

152
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:32,997
It's fucking awful, that stuff.

153
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,727
The fucking brown stuff
is for the workers.

154
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:41,247
The white stuff, now that IS for
the bosses. Come look.

155
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:48,077
I've heard very bad,
bad, bad things

156
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:51,357
about you Birmingham people.

157
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,327
You're Gypsies, right?

158
00:11:57,327 --> 00:12:00,797
So what, do you live in a
fucking tent or a caravan?

159
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:04,437
I came here to discuss business
with you, Mr Solomons.

160
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:09,117
Well rum's for fun
and fucking, innit?

161
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,637
So, whisky, now that...

162
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,637
That is for business.

163
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,247
Let's talk first, eh?

164
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,277
Suit yourself.

165
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:25,607
They say you
had your life saved by a policeman.

166
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,837
I have policemen on my payroll.

167
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:33,197
I don't like policemen because
policemen, they can't be trusted.

168
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:36,477
Mr Sabini uses policeman
all the time.

169
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:40,237
That's why he's winning the war
in London and you are losing it.

170
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:42,287
A war ain't over
until it's over, mate.

171
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,887
You were in the war?

172
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:56,607
I once carried out my own personal
form of stigmata on an Italian.

173
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:02,517
I pushed his face up against the
trench and shoved a six-inch

174
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:06,637
nail up his fucking nose and I
hammered it home with a duck board.

175
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,167
It was fucking biblical, mate.

176
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:14,597
So don't come in here and sit
there in my chair and tell me

177
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:18,007
that I'm losing my war
to a fucking wop.

178
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:20,927
That war was a long time ago.

179
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,677
You need to be more realistic.

180
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:26,887
"Realistic", yeah?

181
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:30,477
Realistic?

182
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:34,477
Well, if you weren't losing the war,
then you wouldn't have sent me

183
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:35,757
the telegram.

184
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:38,237
Really?
You forget your fucking telegram.

185
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:39,917
The telegram just said, "Hello."

186
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,317
Very simple, you want
to sell me something.

187
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,397
What?

188
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,647
~ We join forces.
~ Fuck off.

189
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:50,797
No!

190
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:51,887
Categorical.

191
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:54,677
Fucking ridiculous.

192
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:57,047
Mr Solomons.

193
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:02,247
Your distillery
provides one-tenth of your income.

194
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,117
Protection is another 10%.

195
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,927
And the rest you
make from the race tracks.

196
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:10,797
I know you keep
a gun in the drawer.

197
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,757
I know you keep
it beside the whiskey.

198
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:14,847
I know you offer a deal or death.

199
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,117
I know what I'm saying
makes you angry.

200
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:26,837
But I am offering you a solution.
You see, Mr Sabini is running

201
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,677
all your bookies off your courses.

202
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:33,647
And he is closing down the
premises that take your rum.

203
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,407
And people don't
trust your protection anymore.

204
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:42,127
You're the bloke who shot
Billy Kimber, right?

205
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,077
You did, you fucking shot him.
That's you.

206
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,677
You fucking betrayed him, mate.

207
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,237
So it'd be entirely
appropriate to do what

208
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,287
I am thinking in my head to you
right now.

209
00:14:56,327 --> 00:15:00,687
I can offer you 100 good men.
All with weapons.

210
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,637
And a new relationship with
the police.

211
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:09,837
Intelligence. Intelligence is a very
valuable thing, innit, my friend?

212
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:13,047
And usually it comes far
too fucking late.

213
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:19,207
Let's say I shot you already,
right, in the fucking face.

214
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:24,157
And the bullet goes bone, mush,
bone, cabinet over there.

215
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,157
Which is a shame, innit,

216
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,877
cos that cabinet's fucked now
and I got to get shot of it.

217
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:33,037
So, what I'd do is this...

218
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:34,687
It's fucking simple, mate.

219
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,997
I cut that cabinet in half, don't I?

220
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:47,967
I do I just literally... I cut...

221
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,767
I cut the cabinet
literally in half, mate.

222
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:57,037
And I take one half
of the cabinet, all right,

223
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,637
and put it into a barrel and I take
the other half of the cabinet

224
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:03,357
in all its pieces and I put that
into another barrel, right?

225
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:06,957
And I send this barrel
off to Mandalay.

226
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,837
And the other barrel off
to somewhere like...

227
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,287
I don't know...

228
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,917
Timbuktu.

229
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,637
~ You ever been? ~ No.

230
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:18,127
No?

231
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,807
Would you like to go?

232
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,607
No.

233
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:27,037
You know, I always thought

234
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,127
that you'd have a great, big,
fucking gold ring in your nose.

235
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,287
I'm sorry, go on.

236
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:36,687
Tell us your plan.

237
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,887
Ada.

238
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,077
How the fuck did you find me?

239
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,197
What, are you reading
Polly's letters?

240
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,717
Polly showed me the letter.

241
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,637
Look, you think you're safe because
you moved flat, but you're not.

242
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,917
~ Polly thinks the same.
~ When will you understand?

243
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:10,687
~ I just want you all out of my life.
~ Ada, look at us, eh?

244
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:15,117
~ And it'll happen again.
~ Yeah, well, next time I'll be ready.

245
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,757
In fact, I want them to try again
cos I'll shoot their balls off!

246
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,477
~ Ada, put the fucking gun away.
~ Get away from me, I'm late for work.

247
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,767
All right, fine. Fine.

248
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,727
Just take this. Take it.

249
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,837
Where you're living now is right
on the edge of Sabini's territory

250
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,917
and all the coppers round there
work for him.

251
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,877
I've got a lot of money coming in
that I can't put through the banks.

252
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:38,637
My accountant says the best thing
is to buy property for cash

253
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,767
and put it in the name
of a family member.

254
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,477
A house? A whole house?

255
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:46,887
It's all yours.

256
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:52,477
Four storeys, eight bedrooms,
kitchen, scullery...

257
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:56,127
Rooms for a maid, if your
political conscience will allow.

258
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,487
At least go and have a look, eh?

259
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,327
Shoot the fucking lot of them.

260
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,247
Mr Sabini? The police are here.

261
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,047
Tell them to wipe their feet.

262
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:53,357
So why do I
have to tell YOU everything?

263
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:56,597
We can't search every train
that comes into London.

264
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:58,727
They don't use trains,
they use boats.

265
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:03,917
The boatmen are all Gypsies.
He's a fucking Gypsy.

266
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,717
Why do we have to tell them
everything?

267
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,007
OK, we can't search every boat.

268
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:13,637
Lucky for me...

269
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,557
I have a boy in the Jews' rum house.

270
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,917
The Gypsy went to meet Solomons.

271
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:22,397
And after, they drank whisky
and shook hands...

272
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:25,277
and then Alfie gave him
some salt or...

273
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:28,997
some such kike thing
that means peace.

274
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:32,887
What exactly d'you want us to do,
Mr Sabini?

275
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:43,967
Did you bring dog shit in here
on your shoes?

276
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:48,567
Check, have a look.

277
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,037
I can smell something.

278
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,717
You've got photographs of this
Tommy Shelby, though, right?

279
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,437
We have military ID photographs

280
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,877
from his time
with the Warwickshire Yeomanry.

281
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,527
Shelby won medals.

282
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:16,757
OK, so you've got his fucking photo.

283
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:22,127
If he shows his face in Camden Town,
your coppers lift him. All right?

284
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:25,317
You know...

285
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:28,637
..sometimes when I smell something,
it's something that's not real,

286
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,517
it's something more like a...
Like a premonition.

287
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,797
It's like sometimes
I smell something,

288
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,767
but it's not a smell, it's just...

289
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,717
..something isn't right.

290
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:44,207
Mr Sabini, we'll do everything we can
to deal with this man.

291
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,327
Deal?

292
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,407
Did you say, "Do a deal"?

293
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,237
I didn't mean that.

294
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,007
Fuck.

295
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:57,727
Fuck.

296
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,277
~ You've been fucking got at.
~ No, you're being ridiculous.

297
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,237
Somebody's fucking sat you down.

298
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,077
Somebody's fucking
sat you down and talked to you!

299
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:10,837
~ Mr Sabini... ~ We should go.

300
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:14,557
This fucking Gypsy has sat down
with the fucking coppers!

301
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,197
~ Mr Sabini. ~ You fucking...

302
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,677
..and you're taking
with both fucking hands -

303
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:21,607
off of me and off of him!

304
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:26,237
OK. So now YOU fucking
follow Shelby.

305
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:29,967
You fucking follow him
and you finish him!

306
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,367
Oh...

307
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,327
Oh, shit!

308
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,757
I told yous, boys, 'ere she is.

309
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,527
What the bloody hell is going on?

310
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:32,077
When did you get back?

311
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:35,317
I didn't want to
miss your birthday, Pol.

312
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,837
Back to work.

313
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:39,197
How d'you know it's my birthday?
Nobody ever knows.

314
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:43,597
Ah, it's different this year.
John, Finn, bring the car round.

315
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:47,807
~ Where are we going? ~ To unwrap
your birthday present. After you.

316
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,487
Good morning!

317
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:17,007
~ You said you were gonna buy Ada
a house. ~ Yep, that's right, I did.

318
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,087
Just had a bit of cash left over.

319
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:23,327
This is ours?

320
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:26,647
No, Polly...

321
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:28,807
..this is yours.

322
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,367
Cos you deserve it.

323
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,447
What would I do
with all these rooms?

324
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:50,607
Well, you could... relax for one.

325
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,287
Come here at weekends.

326
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:57,447
It has a garden, eh?

327
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:02,877
You love gardens.
You can grow roses, Pol.

328
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:04,437
I don't know, have a piano.

329
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,997
Have people round,
they can have a singsong, eh?

330
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:11,647
~ God help the bloody neighbours(!)
~ Fuck the neighbours.

331
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:17,087
Welcome home, Pol.

332
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:34,087
Arthur, why don't you take the boys
outside and wait by the car.

333
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,407
Pol...

334
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:49,607
I know you haven't been happy
for a while.

335
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:54,607
And I know why.

336
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:02,087
Esme is all right, you know?

337
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:07,167
She's got a good heart, she has.

338
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:10,927
I've spoken to her...

339
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:14,047
..and she told me.

340
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:19,647
Told you what?

341
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:23,487
She told me what it is
that would make you happy.

342
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,797
I've spoken to our contacts
in the police.

343
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:32,317
They have contacts in the council,

344
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:35,287
and they have contacts with the
people who keep the parish records.

345
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,767
Records of adoptions...

346
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:42,527
..and of confidential
forced removals.

347
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,287
Now, with your permission...

348
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,997
.. I'd like to grease a few palms

349
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,007
and take a look at the records
they never showed you.

350
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:58,157
Pol...

351
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:00,037
I am going to find
your son and daughter

352
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:01,887
and I'm gonna bring them home.

353
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:04,837
That's what this house is for.

354
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:08,527
So that YOU can bring
your family home where they belong.

355
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,207
We're moving up, Pol.

356
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,847
Go have a look what you think.

357
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,077
Can you hear that?

358
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,797
'Gah!'

359
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:01,487
Silence at last.

360
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:06,647
~ And it belongs to us.
~ 'Gah...'

361
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:09,757
'Mummy...'

362
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,597
What's in there?

363
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:14,727

Well, there's a lot coming in

Well, as long as there's more
coming in, we're all right.

372
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:55,047
This came for you today.

373
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:58,037
It's all the way from America,
New York.

374
00:27:58,087 --> 00:27:59,607
Somewhere called Poughkeepsie?

375
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:03,277
And the decorators doing
The Garrison want paying.

376
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:05,597
Arthur forgot and pulled a gun
when they asked, so...

377
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,477
they've stopped
and everything's green.

378
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,117
All right, well, just pay it.

379
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:11,677
Oh, and we need to put an advert
in the Mail -

380
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,997
"Garrison: Grand Reopening."

381
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,997
Oh, and you said there's a letter
that had to go today.

382
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:19,687
Special delivery.
I wrote it in the diary.

383
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:24,197
Yes... I haven't written it out yet.

384
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:26,837
Well, you can just tell me
and I'll write it down.

385
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:28,927
I've learnt shorthand.

386
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:32,327
Fair enough.

387
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,047
Dear Mr Churchill...

388
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:41,247
Has your pencil broken?

389
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:45,437
No. No, do go on.

390
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:47,247
Dear Mr Churchill...

391
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:54,197
I've been approached by an agent
of the Crown to carry out a task,

392
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:57,117
as yet unspecified.

393
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:01,847
'His name is Major Campbell
and I believe he reports to you.'

394
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:07,037
'Therefore, I decided to make
direct contact with you

395
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:10,367
'to make sure that certain things
are clearly understood.'

396
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:15,117
' "Mr Churchill, you should know
that I am a former British soldier

397
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,317
' "and if you look at my war record,

398
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:21,157
' "you will see that I fought
bravely at Verdun and at the Somme'

399
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:24,157
"Also, you will see
that my actions at Mons

400
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,757
"saved thousands of Allied lives.

401
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,637
"I know that you resigned
your ministerial position

402
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,597
"and the safety of an office

403
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,317
"to go and fight on the front line
with the men.

404
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:37,517
"I read that you fought bravely,
Mr Churchill.

405
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:41,077
"Therefore, I hope I will be treated
in any dealings we have

406
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,397

00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:49,277

408
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:52,117

00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,847
"Yours sincerely, Thomas Shelby."

410
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:59,687
Military Medal and the DCM...

411
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:03,927
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

412
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:08,887
Hands up in this room,
those who were at the Somme.

413
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:13,047
Those who were at
the Battle of Verdun?

414
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,967
Thomas Shelby was a tunneller.

415
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,557
His demand is rather amusing.

416
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:29,917
He has asked that
the Colonial Office grant him

417
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:32,877
an Empire export licence.

418
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:37,157
Specifically a licence covering
India, Malay Peninsula,

419
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:39,157
Canada and Russia.

420
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:43,717
He plans to transport certain
manufactured goods from Birmingham

421
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,797
to the Poplar Docks.

422
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:47,677
And you plan to agree to this demand?

423
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:50,967
Dear God, Major Campbell...

424
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:55,957
We will be asking this man
to carry out an assassination

425
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:57,917
on behalf of the Crown,

426
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:00,797
once more risking his life.

427
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:05,597
These demands by comparison
are slight and easily met

428
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:09,997
with a few quiet words over lunch
with the appropriate ministers.

429
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:12,677
Sir... with the greatest respect...

430
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:15,327
Thomas Shelby is a murdering...

431
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,247
..cut-throat, mongrel, gangster.

432
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:26,957
And yet, the tunnels were dug
beneath our feet to silence the guns

433
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,447
pointed at our heads.

434
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:34,037
Get Thomas Shelby's details
from Campbell

435
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:37,717
and get some kind of
royal appointment stamp.

436
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,717
Temporary.

437
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:43,557
~ Temporary?
~ Just until the deed is done.

438
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:46,277
Agreed, Major Campbell?

439
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:49,447
And then I can...
proceed as discussed?

440
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:53,887
Agreed, sir.

441
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,727
Come on, let's go in.

442
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,127
Here, pass the ball!

443
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:18,727
Come on.

444
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:22,637
'Come on in, boys.
Did you have a good game?'

445
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:25,117
'I'm starving,
have you done anything for lunch?'

446
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,517
It'll be on in a minute, in you go.

447
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:28,637
Go in and wash your hands, boys,
all right?

448
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:29,877
'Come on, mister.'

449
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:31,847
Mrs Johnson?

450
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:35,207
Yes. Who are you?

451
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,967
I'm from Birmingham Council,
Bordesley parish.

452
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:42,637
No-one wrote to me. What d'you want?

453
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:45,877
I would like to talk about your son,
about Henry.

454
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:47,437
Can I come in?

455
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:50,637
I'd rather you didn't,
he doesn't like to talk about this.

456
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,327
I see.

457
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:57,647
So what does Henry know about
his real identity, Mrs Johnson?

458
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:02,837
I only deal with Mr Ross from the
agency and he only ever writes, so...

459
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:04,477
Why are you here in person?

460
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:06,847
Well, the boy is approaching
his 18th birthday.

461
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,127
This isn't right!

462
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,797
You're not from the council,
something isn't right.

463
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:15,207
Hmm. What does he know, Mrs Johnson?

464
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:19,767
He knows his mother couldn't cope.

465
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:24,927
She drank too much, she used opium...
she used to beat him.

466
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,677
But that isn't the truth, is it?

467
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,637
Look, I think you should come back
when my husband's here.

468
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,197
Does he know what his real name is?

469
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:35,957
His real name is Johnson,
Henry Johnson,

470
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:39,317
now I would like you to go away and
come back when my husband's here.

471
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:43,237
The truth is he was taken from his
mother without her permission.

472
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,557
~ Henry, go back inside, please.
~ Who are you?

473
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,597
~ Please, Henry, go on!
~ Your real name is Michael Gray.

474
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:52,157
~ No!
~ Your real mother wants to see you.

475
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:55,557
Her address is on the back of this
card. She just wants to talk.

476
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:57,317
~ Go away. ~ She just wants to talk.

477
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:00,167
Go away and leave us alone. Go away!

478
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:07,157
Come on, let's go back inside.

479
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:09,007
Come on,
I'll get you something to eat.

480
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:11,647
Come on, Henry.

481
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,687
Come on... Come on.

482
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,247
Call yourself a Shelby?
Fucking hit him, Finn.

483
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,277
Hit him, that's right.

484
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,037
All right, Isiah, your turn.

485
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:29,727
Finn! Call yourself a Shelby?
Fucking hit him, for fuck's sake!

486
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:32,647
Hit him.

487
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,797
Get him out of there, get him back!

488
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,557
Get him back!
Arthur, for fuck's sake!

489
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:45,127
Get him out of there!

490
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:03,687
Rockfair is down to sixes...

491
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,287
Right, what happened?

492
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:45,397
~ It was a fair fight. ~ Yeah.

493
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,567
Arthur just caught him
with a good 'un.

494
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:54,157
I saw the body,
don't fucking lie to me.

495
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:56,647
I saw the body,
what fucking happened?

496
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:01,007
I'm not family, I'm saying nothing.

497
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:06,607
Arthur...

498
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:09,927
..he's blown a few times lately.

499
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,967
Six, seven.

500
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,727
It's like he's not there
in the head.

501
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,047
He can't even hear "stop".
Even his own name.

502
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:24,607
And then he cries.

503
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:31,927
Right, listen to me.

504
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:35,047
That's two fucking stories.

505
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:39,037
Your brother killed a boy.

506
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:42,517
There were witnesses,
there will be questions,

507
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,477
get your story straight,
it was an accident.

508
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,047
Fuck off.

509
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:56,287
I spoke to the doctor,
he said the kid...

510
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:59,437
..probably had a weak heart.

511
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:01,807
We'll look after his mother.

512
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:03,967
It'll be fine.

513
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:07,527
Polly said I should have stuck
with the medicine.

514
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:11,727
I said that you know best.

515
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,447
It's like a fucking boat, Tommy.

516
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:22,727
Full of heavy cargo,
like coal or iron.

517
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:26,647
Sometimes it slips to one end.

518
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,727
And the boat tips.

519
00:37:32,247 --> 00:37:33,647
I can feel it slipping.

520
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,367
And I can... feel the boat tipping.

521
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:42,727
But there ain't nothing
I can do about it.

522
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:49,117
It's like me fuckin' head's
just like this fuckin'...

523
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:52,357
black fucking barge!

524
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:56,277
And it just fucking... drifts...

525
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:59,597
in and out, in and out...

526
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:02,357
Well, we're home a long time now,
Arthur.

527
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,807
We've home a long time.

528
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:10,437
~ I thought you were all right.
~ Yeah, well...

529
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:15,167
I-I-I don't think I am... Tommy.

530
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:22,047
Take this fucking thing
away from me.

531
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:29,327
Just fuck off, Arthur.

532
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:32,367
You know what?

533
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:37,597
I've had enough.

534
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:41,917
I've fucking had enough.
Just fuck off.

535
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,247
(What?)

536
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,647
I'm supposed to treat you
like a fucking kid again, eh?

537
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:53,127
Keep you away from guns
and fucking rope, is that it?

538
00:38:54,447 --> 00:38:56,437
You think I haven't got
enough on?!

539
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:57,717
~ Stop it, Tommy. ~ Arthur?

540
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:00,157
~ You think I haven't got enough on?!
~ Stop it.

541
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:03,357
~ The war is done!
Shut the door on it! ~ Stop it.

542
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,677
~ Shut the door on it, like I did, eh?
~ Like you do?

543
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:07,917
Can you do that? Yeah?

544
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,637
~ Like I fucking did.
~ I'm not fucking you.

545
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:12,557
~ Shut the fucking door, eh?
~ But I'm not fucking you!

546
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:15,157
I...am not fucking you!

547
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:18,517
Everyone fucking knows it!

548
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,927
God!

549
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:25,727
Look at yourself. Eh?

550
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:31,597
Look at yourself.

551
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:35,607
Take a long, hard,
fucking look at yourself.

552
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:25,877
Time for lunch, sir.

553
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:29,847
I thought we could eat at the desk,
like the old days.

554
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:37,717
You remembered.

555
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:39,597
Tongue and pickle, sir.

556
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:43,277
But it's the single stroke
of mustard, that's the thing.

557
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:45,367
~ Hmm. ~ The fine detail.

558
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:50,567
Speaking of detail...

559
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:57,487
How much is Thomas Shelby
paying you in bribes per week? Hm?

560
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:05,237
Actually, I already know -
£2 a week, £8 a month,

561
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:07,967
plus extras for specific favours.

562
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:12,117
When I left, you were an honest man.

563
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:15,927
And now you're on
the Peaky Blinders' payroll.

564
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:24,117
Shelby is a worm and feeds off
the rotten parts of your mind.

565
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:27,837
He gets in through your ear,
with a whisper.

566
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:33,247
He crawls in over your tongue as you
lie to the judge and the pastor.

567
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:35,847
Mr Moss...

568
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:41,437
We are entering a bloody phase
of a bloody war

569
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:43,967
with no quarter asked or given.

570
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:51,167
But as of this moment, you are now
back on the side of the angels.

571
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:57,567
Shelby thinks you work for him,
but in truth, you work for me.

572
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,887
And I will use you mercilessly.

573
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:54,447
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

574
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:57,887
As you can see, one is white...

575
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:00,927
..and one is black.

576
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:07,807
What you saw in your dreams...

577
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,527
..was right.

578
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:14,247
Your daughter is dead.

579
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:30,327
Um... You do it, I can't read it.

580
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:37,807
After Anna was taken from you,
she was put with a...

581
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:42,647
With a family of a...
railway station master in Stafford.

582
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:48,157
She... never settled.

583
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:50,527
So she kept running away.

584
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,997
She got on a train
to Birmingham once...

585
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:58,887
Eventually they sent her
to Australia...

586
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:02,487
..where she died of something
called spring fever.

587
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,367
So my little Anna...

588
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,677
..travelled all the way
back across the world

589
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,247
to be with me in my dreams?

590
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:32,167
She came all by herself.

591
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,407
Well... that's one train
they couldn't get her off.

592
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:48,327
But, Pol...

593
00:44:49,327 --> 00:44:50,527
.. Michael is alive.

594
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:01,407
He's in England...

595
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:05,367
..and I know where he lives,
I went there.

596
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:09,087
~ But, Pol... ~ And?

597
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:12,447
OK, Polly, listen to me.

598
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:16,087
Just listen to me, please.

599
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:19,877
Pol!

600
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:24,807
The woman that he calls "mother"
will never let him come here.

601
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,607
Just tell me where he is, Tommy.

602
00:45:30,447 --> 00:45:33,917
Polly, if you go there
and you get mad

603
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:36,837
and she gets mad
and she calls the police,

604
00:45:36,887 --> 00:45:39,077
they will never let you
anywhere near him

605
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:41,167
and the boy will get scared.

606
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:44,247
That's what will happen, Pol.

607
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:47,407
Polly.

608
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:51,007
~ Polly...
~ You just tell me where he is, Thomas.

609
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:58,247
~ Tell me where he is, Thomas! ~ Polly...

610
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,527
Pulling the gun...

611
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:06,687
Pulling the gun
is why I can't tell you.

612
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:15,477
Pol, I'm sorry, you're going
to have to wait till he's 18.

613
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:17,647
Till he's old enough
to make his own decision.

614
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:24,767
Wait?!

615
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,807
You tell me where he is!

616
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:36,047
If you shoot me, you'll never know.

Hurry up, the party's starting.

621
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:26,917
~ Good, carry on.
~ Finn, where you going?

622
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:28,647
~ To talk to Arthur. ~ Right.

623
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:57,567
~ Arthur? ~ Go away.

~ For what?

625
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:04,767
The Garrison.

626
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:10,247
The reopening of your pub.
It's tonight.

627
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:15,277
~ Tommy don't want me there.
~ It was Tommy who told me to get you.

628
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,277
He says it's your name
above that door,

629
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,557
~ so you've got to be there. ~ No...

630
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:21,367
No, look at me.

631
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:25,757
I'm staying away. Go away.

632
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,087
Get out.

633
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:41,647
I told you to go away.

634
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:48,207
Sometimes...

635
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,727
..when we boys are feeling blue...

636
00:48:54,687 --> 00:48:55,847
This is what we do.

637
00:48:56,847 --> 00:48:58,447
It's called Tokyo.

638
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:26,887
It's good stuff, Arthur.
It'll help you.

639
00:49:28,607 --> 00:49:30,287
For special occasions.

640
00:49:55,447 --> 00:49:58,887
Oh, boys! My fucking Garrison!

641
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:02,637
Take that. Take that an' all.

642
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:05,077
'Ere you are, Lizzie.
Let me get you a light.

643
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,197
There you go, my darling. Jeremiah,
I'll be with you in a second.

644
00:50:08,247 --> 00:50:10,677
Oh!

645
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:12,487
Look at the place!

646
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:18,317
~ You all right? ~ Busier we are,
the faster time passes.

647
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:19,767
Yeah?

648
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:26,277
Arthur...
Tokyo, it's fuel for races, eh?

649
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:29,487
~ But you've seen a doped horse
after a race... ~ Oh, yeah.

650
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,807
Grand openings and race days only,
brother.

651
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:36,077
~ All right?
~ 'Go on then, Tommy!'

652
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:38,477
~ 'There you go, come on, drink up.'
~ Boys.

653
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,037
All right, Mick?

654
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:44,447
~ Tom. ~ Finn! Gimme that.

655
00:50:45,687 --> 00:50:47,207
Keep him off the whisky, John.

656
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,007
Pol.

657
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:37,477
~ Ada! I didn't know you were coming.
~ There's Aunt Polly.

658
00:52:37,527 --> 00:52:39,287
~ Aww... ~ Hi!

659
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,757
Hey, who's that?

660
00:52:42,807 --> 00:52:45,197
~ D'you want a cuddle?
~ Polly, that's right.

661
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:46,437
~ Take him. ~ Polly...

662
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:50,157
~ Oh, Ada, why don't you think
about coming home? ~ Hello, Ada.

663
00:52:50,207 --> 00:52:51,327
Say you'd...

664
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:57,077
Tommy...

665
00:52:57,127 --> 00:53:00,517
~ So what do you think, eh?
~ It's very...

666
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:02,047
~ Gold? ~ Yeah.

667
00:53:04,327 --> 00:53:07,197
~ Hello, Ada.
~ Hello, trouble, how're you doing?

668
00:53:07,247 --> 00:53:08,997
~ Mmmm...
~ Oh, you're... spilling my drink!

669
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:11,077
Hey, Arthur, look who it is.

670
00:53:11,127 --> 00:53:13,837
So what d'you want me
to say to her?

671
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:16,877
Just talk to her.
No-one can get through to her.

672
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,287
Tell her I had no choice.

673
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:22,167
I appreciate this.

674
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:32,637
~ Hello, brother.
~ Ada, come here, you!

675
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:35,117
You big bear!

676
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:38,527
Polly?
Why don't you come and join us?

677
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:47,207
~ What? ~ I'm not an idiot.

678
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:49,967
He asked you to come, didn't he?

679
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:01,797
I don't want conversation,
I want an address.

680
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,207
Until I have that...

681
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,197
.. I've not got anything to say.

682
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:09,597
~ Now, it's a party! ~ Yeah...

683
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,487
It is! Oh!

684
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:18,887
~ And I'm going to enjoy myself.
~ No, Pol, don't be silly.

685
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:21,807
Excuse me?

686
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:25,287
Would you care to dance?

687
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:29,527
It'd... be my pleasure.

688
00:54:36,847 --> 00:54:40,487
My love,
pleasure hasn't even begun.

689
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:54,967
Excuse me?

690
00:56:56,487 --> 00:56:58,567
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

691
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:01,647
I was told she lived here
at number 17.

692
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,007
I came last night
but there was nobody here.

693
00:57:07,287 --> 00:57:08,327
So I waited.

694
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:12,047
What do you want
with Elizabeth Gray?

695
00:57:14,927 --> 00:57:16,767
I think she might be my mother.
