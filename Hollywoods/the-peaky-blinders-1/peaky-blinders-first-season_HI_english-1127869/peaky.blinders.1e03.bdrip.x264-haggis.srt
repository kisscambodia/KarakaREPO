Mmm. look at you.

707
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,526
You look like a bloody film star.

708
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,525
(GASPS)

709
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,764
I want a cigarette.

710
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,127
-(GLASS SHATTERING)
-Oh, look, I've dropped something.

711
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,890
Pick it up.

712
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,201
- Pick it up yourself.
-You're a fucking barmaid.

713
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,487
If I drop a glass on the floor,
you pick it up.

714
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,289
I want to watch you pick it up.

715
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,528
-(GLASS CRUNCHING)
-Right, you little slag.

716
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,524
- I tried to be nice. Yeah?
-(GROANS)

717
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,809
If l drop a glass on the floor,

718
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,404
you bend over and fucking pick up
the fucking glass.

719
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,721
- Okay? (SHOUTING) What?
-No, sir. No.

720
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,325
KIMBER: What are you doing here?

721
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,528
- I've got another hour.
-TOMMY: just wait.

722
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,444
Listen to me. just listen to me.

723
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,451
I was going to let you go through
with this but, in the end,

724
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,525
my conscience got the better of me.
She looks good on the outside,

725
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,769
but she has the clap.

726
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,089
TOMMY: Yeah. Syphilis.

727
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,090
When you took a shine to her,
I thought I'd use her.

728
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,806
Someone told me she had the syph,
I thought, "What the hell?"

729
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,562
Call it my better nature.

730
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,050
She's, uh, she's a whore.

731
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,484
- Well, just go and wait in the oar.
-I can walk on my own.

732
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,608
Can we shake hands
and forget this ever happened?

733
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,764
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

734
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,923
(GATE CREAKING)

735
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,411
Start of the day,
I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.

736
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,043
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.

737
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,606
You're a fucking bastard,
offering me like that.

738
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,608
But then you change your mind.

739
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,363
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?

740
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,722
