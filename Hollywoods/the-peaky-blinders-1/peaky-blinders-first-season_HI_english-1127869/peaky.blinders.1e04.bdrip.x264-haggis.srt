Ada!

174
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,203
I know what was in the envelope.

175
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,403
I looked. Money.

176
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,322
And that bloke that we met in London,
who you said was a Frenchman,

177
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,289
he was Russian.
I'm not an idiot, Freddie.

178
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,200
How is it, that you take all the risks

179
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,726
and Stanley Chapman gets the money?

180
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,968
- It's money for the cause.

182
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,162
I would be, if your brothers
had anything to do with it.

183
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,961
This isn't about them,
this is about you. And me.

184
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,447
And this.

185
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,006
(SIGHS) You're a dreamer, Freddie.

186
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,050
You give money away
while we rot in here.

187
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,648
You talk about revolution.

188
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,846
I need to know.

189
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,168

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,249

Did you have something to do with this?

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,249
I asked an acquaintance for an address.

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,088
She said she'd only give
it to me anonymously.

197

She's afraid of the consequences.

Tommy, I'd like to suggest a strategy.

you have an address for me?

201

Anonymous tip off.

202
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,087
The address of Stanley Chapman.

203
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,366
- You promised me Freddie Thorne.
-This is instead of Freddie Thorne.

204
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,283
- No deal.
-Inspector,

205
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,844
Stanley Chapman is a bigger
fish than Freddie Thorne.

206
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,211
He's currently holding £200 in cash

207
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,562
given to The Communist Party
by the Russian government.

208
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,722
That's right, Chapman
has snow on his boots.

209
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,168
And all you need is a shovel.

210
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,321
If he talks, you'll have proof.

211
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,530
You might even get that medal.

212
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,440
Now,

213
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,683
before I give you the address,

214
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,171
I want your word

215
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,444
that you'll let Freddie Thorne

216
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,281
and my sister leave the city.

217
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,127
Very well. You have my word.

218
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,205
I'd say our little truce
has proven quite

219
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,851
productive for both of us, Inspector.

220
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,201
I'll get the information and protection.

221
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,369
And you? Well...

222
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,450
You get Bolsheviks.

223
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,084
But on a more pressing matter,

224
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,844
I'm afraid that Mr Churchill
is becoming impatient.

225
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,810
And I fear that,

226
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,564
if you don't get back
those stolen weapons soon,

227
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,845
I will be replaced.

228
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,482
That will be the finish
for me, that's for sure.

229
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,487
When my business with Kimber is done,

230
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,962
the guns will be returned.
That was the deal.

231
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,646
Then I'm in your hands, completely.

232
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,210
You hold all the cards.

233
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,451
But, I hope to God that
my dismissal doesn't come

234
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,763
before your decision to
hand back those guns.

235
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,482
And I say this for your sake because,

236
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,562
if I were to be fired,
and it were your fault,

237
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,321
I would do things that
would shame the devil.

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,366
My fury is a thing to behold.

240
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,680
On my last day in power, for example,

241
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,966
I would see to it

242
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,886
that you and your scum brothers have
your heads stowed in with mallets

243
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,321
and spades.

244
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,010
And your sister, too.

245
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,409
That baby inside her would
be of no consequence to me.

246
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,602
The only one to be spared

247
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,608
would be your little brother Finn.

248
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,842
He would, however, be lifted,
as a juvenile,

249
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,570
and dumped in that part
of the adult prison

250
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,571
where men have the most
appetite for boys like him.

251
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,647
Oh, that would be
a dark day indeed, Mr Shelby,

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,163
if my dismissal comes
before your decision.

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,530

where it came from.

I'm sure with a little persuasion

he'll tell us everything he knows.

things in this idiotic century.

Mr Chapman until he tells

us where we can find
Freddie Thorne and his wife.

of that rat hole you're keeping her in.

Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

309
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,403
And you think this copper
will keep his word?

310
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,570
If he does, you're safe.
If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up.

311
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,729
You'll still have to leave
town, same result.

312
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,409
- So neat.
-So leave.

313
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,489
Except there's one thing that
you've got wrong,

314
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,449
Stanley won't be able to give up my
address because he doesn't know it.

315
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,842
That's how it works.
None of us know each other's addresses.

316
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,361
So you've wasted your fucking time.

317
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,606
And they'll keep beating him and beating
him for information he doesn't have.

318
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,362
So all you've done is sign the
death warrant of a good man.

319
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,450
- So you won't leave?
-No, I won't fucking leave.

320
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,767
And if you want me out of Birmingham,
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

321
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,330
You lay a hand on our Ada and I'll
put you in a wooden box myself.

322
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,806
You raised a stubborn one there, Irene.

323
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,324
You told me to carry on.

324
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,004
I wanted to stop.

325
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,648
He had some kind of seizure.

326
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,002
(SIGHS) So you killed him.

327
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,641
Did he give you an address?

328
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,731
What's the matter with you?
He fell down some stairs.

329
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,928
This is not bloody Belfast.

330
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,602
Not yet, but if men like him
get their way, it soon will be.

331
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,408
So find some stairs, throw him
down, and call the coroner.

332
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,366
Use Grayson.

333
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,010
If he has any awkward questions,

334
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,970
ask about the welfare of his mistress
in Saltley.

335
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,610
That'll shut him up.

336
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,800
To think I used to live
in a shithole like this.

337
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,845
Bloody animals.

338
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,730
The Shelbys really are doing
an excellent job for us.

339
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,566
We haven't lost a single penny to

340

So we throw the dog a bone.

343
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,201
I think so.

344
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,082
Mr Kimber, Mr Roberts,
come and have a look around.

345
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,001

(INDISTINCT CHATTER}

347
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,163
Well, I thought the Lees
turned you over?

348
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,641
You shouldn't listen to gossip,
Mr Kimber. This way.

349
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,046
Business is good.

350
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,850
Especially since now you know

351
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,127
which horse is going to win
before you set the odds.

352
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,961
Information is very much appreciated.

353
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,243
All right, well, where are they?

354
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,771
John, Lovelock. Scudboat, in here.

355
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,331
This is my team.

356
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,526
They will take up their pitch at your
convenience, Mr Kimber.

357
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,049
John is the book, Scudboat is the
bag man, and of course,

358
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,930
we bring our own protection.

359
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,128
Warwick, next Saturday,
at least 50 yards from the beer tent.

360
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,042
Gentleman, and lady.

361
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,484
I have in my hand

362
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,044
a legal betting licence,
issued by the Board of Control.

363
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,969
The Shelby family has its first, legal

364
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,720

(ALL CHEERING)

366
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,721
Congratulations.

367
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,161
There you go.

368
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,841
Congratulations.

369
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,165
30, 40, 50...

370
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,728
These cigarettes
have a strange smell, Arthur.

371
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,881
They smell like rotting water.

372
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,207
And look,

373
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,725
rats have got into some of them.

374
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,447
They're stolen, are they not?

375
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,641
Don't ask.

376
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,085
They smell because you
keep them in the boat.

377
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,607
What do you care? Now, can you
come check my adding up, please?

378
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,487
You know, you should make a
new start of this place.

379
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,041
Do it properly-

380
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,169
These cigarettes are not fit to sell.

381
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,921
Smells like Gallipoli.

382
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,327
You should find a new
place to store them.

383
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,681
It has to be far away from coppers.

384
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,171
Oh, but not rats.

385
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,487
All the wharves have rats, Grace.

386
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,924
What's wrong with a dry warehouse?

387
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,326
Tommy's orders.

388
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,566
What orders?

389
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,282
Always keep contraband near
petrol boat moorings.

390
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,211
Don't boats get searched?

391
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,884
We moor them at junctions.

392
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,850
So there's more than one way out.

393
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,050
No locks within a mile
so we can move that stuff,

394
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,601
fast.

395
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,929
Your brother doesn't obey the law,
but he has rules.

396
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,050
Precise man, your brother.

397
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,366
Is my adding up right?

398
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,606
It is now.

399
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,321
CAMPBELL: One.

400
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,801
Two.

401
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,087
Three.

402
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,085
<i>And four.</i>

403
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,807
<i>And we'll search them one-by-one.</i>

404
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,450
Please, Lord, let that which
I seek be found here.

405
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,248
Not so much as a bullet, sir.

406
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,203
Just more cigarettes and whisky.

407
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,562
Arthur tells me you've
been asking questions.

408
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,010
About how we run our business

409
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,411
and how we get our booze

410
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,721
and where we keep it.

411
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,286
I'm just trying to help.

412
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,805
Let's you and me go for a walk.

413
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,486
Where to?

414
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,721
Come on.

415
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,326
Why here?

416
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,002
You're a good Catholic girl, aren't you?

417
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,281
Yes.

418
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
Well, then you know it's here
people come to confess.

419
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,164
(SIGHS) After you.

420
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,165
Well, here it is, Grace.

421
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,406
I'll confess.

422
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,721
I need someone.

423
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,766
Kimber has an adviser by
the name of Roberts.

424
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,246
He talks well.

425
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,130
Keeps the accounts.

426
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,649
Runs the legal side of the business.

427
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,086
And you need a Roberts?

428
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,170
Arthur tells me you have ideas.

429
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,564
I'm not an accountant, nor a lawyer.

430
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,721
No.

431
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,489
No, but you have something 1 need.

432
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,961
Class.

433
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,447
I need someone who looks
right at the big meetings.

434
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,365
Epsom, Ascot.

435
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,771
Is this a job interview?

436
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,330
Arthur says you're good with numbers.

437
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,404
(LAUGHS) Oh, well, that's relative.
He's quite poor.

438
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,481
(SCOFFS)

439
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,245
You keep the books in order.

440
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,560
They were chaotic.

441
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,891
But you're a liar.

442
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,564
No Catholic girl would enter a church

443
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,404
and forget to make
the sign of the cross.

444
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,007
You're very perceptive.

445
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,924
First, you lied to me about that
pub you used to work in.

446
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,563
Now I find out you're a Protestant.

447
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,404
- Do you care?
-No.

448
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,731
I like to fit in.

449
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,326
You pull a pint

450
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,085
like someone who's thinking about it.

451
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,089
This is not an interview,
this is an interrogation.

452
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,161
Sit down.

453
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,926
Look, Grace.

454
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,807
(SIGHS)

455
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,609
You've washed up in a
place you don't belong,

456
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,441
for whatever reason.

457
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,360
My good fortune.

458
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,720
And perhaps mine.

459
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,929
You know that most of
what I do is illegal?

460
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,846
I'm not blind.

461
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,449
And yet you'd still be
willing to work for me?

462
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,970
Are you offering me the job?

463
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,761
(SCOFFS)

464
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,561
Then I accept.

465
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,925
There's something else you should know.

466
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,084
A very important detail about
my reasons for employing you.

467
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,406
You disappoint me.

468
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,360
No you resign?

469
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,921
No.

470
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,208
My appetite for the work
has only increased.

Hello, Lizzie?

00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,608
That bag looks heavy. jump in!

476
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,091
It is.

477
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,446
You like kids?

478
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,610
- Yeah.
-Good,

479
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,085
because John's got four of them.

480
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,491
It's all right, I'm not going
to try to talk you out of it.

481
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,766
I just want to talk.

482
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,681
Then you're against us?

483
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,170
John is his own man.

484
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,526
And you're your own woman.

485
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,961
Now, Lizzie,

486
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,242
since I came back from France,
I've come to you on many occasions.

487
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,605
Tommy, you didn't tell him?

488
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,366
No, I didn't tell him.

489
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,204
Just like you didn't tell him.

490
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,045
Now, why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

491
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,531
Why didn't you tell him

492
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,930
that you've been sewing
his brother for the past two years?

493
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,005
Because the past is the past.

494
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,929
I don't want to lose him.
He's a good man.

495
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,683
That was the answer I was hoping
you'd give. The past is the past.

496
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,123
You see, our john says you've changed.

497
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,647
And I believe him, and that's good.

498
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,361
Change is good.

499
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,209
These are new times I'm told.

500
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,043
So I wish you both every happiness.

501
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,962
And I want you to see that as
my wedding gift to you

502

to pleasures gone by.

504
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,241
You mean...

505
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,641
One last time?

506
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,081
One last time.

507
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,481
You and me.

508
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,686
It's eight bloody pounds.

510
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,201
So where should we go?

511
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,365
Tommy, should we go to my lodging?

512
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,123
So the past is not the past.

513
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,203
You can keep the money, Lizzie,
just get out of the car.

514

- Tommy, please!
-just get out of the car.

515
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,124
I love him, Tommy, really.

Really.

517
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,685
John will make his own decision.

518
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,681
But he will have the facts.

519
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,001

521
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,084
Of that I have no doubt.

522
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,284
Well, he's obviously not stupid.

523
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,407
All we found was stolen
tobacco and whisky.

524
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,966
Which you left it in place?

525
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,401
Of course.

526
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,325
I would never endanger you.

You're doing well, Grace.

528
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,929
I've been working on Arthur.
He's easier.

529
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,721
Than Thomas?

530
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,841
Yes.

531
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,760
Less intelligent.

532
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,881
Yes.

533
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,642
That's not a word you'd
use about Thomas.

534
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,841
It's your word.

535
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,601
He has promoted me.

536
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,531
He wants me to be
his bookkeeper and secretary.

537
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,121
A cut-throat gangster with a secretary.

538
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,323
The pretensions of these
hoodlums are quite breathtaking.

539
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,081
Are they not?

540
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,324
Yes, quite breathtaking.

541
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,689
He's obviously fallen
quite heavily for you.

542
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,521
I thought you'd be pleased.

543
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,049
I just hope you remember who
you're dealing with, here.

544
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,164
A man who cuts off ears
and cuts out tongues.

I know what he is, sir.

546
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,005
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

547

I come here with
good news and I get this?

I want to take Lizzie for a ride
in the country with the kids.

getting the licence.

There's something I have to tell you.

558
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,771
Yesterday, in the front
seat of that car,

559
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,204
I offered Lizzie some money.

560
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,921
And, john.

561

Marry her, if you want.

I don't like that word, "Limited".

To be respectable,
you have to be limited.

That's what worries me.

582
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,891
I had the phone put in.

583
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,081
It's in the back.

584
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,488
Huh. If I knew someone
else who had a phone,

585
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,286
we could call them.

Rackhams department store.

Will you open it?

00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,206
No.

594
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,281
No one does. She's hiding from me.

595
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,770
I was told she goes to a bathhouse
on Montague Street

597
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,481

anything about asking questions.
