Now, first of all.

191

It's not the people around here
that are disloyal to the King.

192

It's the opposite.

193

You see, we don't want our beloved king

194
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,886
looking down and seeing the things
that have been done to us.

195
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,563
So we are taking down his pictures.

196
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,085
But why are you burning them?

197
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,885
We went through hell for our king.

198

Write all this down!

199
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,721

in our own homes.

would want to see that happening.

00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,569

-Looking good, Tommy.

They're all here for Monaghan Boy.

That's what I like to hear, johnny boy.

353

358
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,721
Get out!

359
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,441
All of you.

360
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,370
- 60 on. Now!
-(DOOR OPENING)

361
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,764
I said tell me his fucking name.

362
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,406
Freddie fucking Thorne!

363
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,131
Yeah. Your best mate since school,
the man who saved your life in France.

364
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,648
So, go on. Go and cut him.

365
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,527
Cut him up and chuck him in the cut.

366
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,087
Oi! I'm a Shelby, too, you know!

367
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,323
Put my fucking film back on.

368
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,002
So Monaghan Boy finally lost?

369
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,606
Third time unlucky.

We took money from all over the city.

371
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,088
Yeah, but you'll pay it back
to people round here.

372
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,051
Buy your popularity back.

373

Already done.

above your weight.

379

- Billy Kimber is there for the taking.
-Says who?

380
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,890
Says Tom and his parliament of one.

381
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,280
- I ran this business for five years.
-Yeah.

382
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,290
While I was away fighting, remember?

383
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,284
Where I learned some things, such as

384
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,971
you strike when the enemy is weak.

385
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,641
And I thought you came here
to talk family business.

I'll deal with it.
You're too busy taking over the world.

388
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,164
It's about Ada. I need to know.

389
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,129
Ada wants you to give
Freddie this letter.

390
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,684
She wants Freddie to know
she's having his baby.

391
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,362
He deserves an opportunity
to do the right thing.

392
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,761

For a woman who's had a hard life of men,

395

you're still full of romance, eh?

396
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,560
What do you think Freddie sees
in our Ada?

397
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,880
- That's Freddie's business.
-No.

398
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,811
No, I'll tell you what he sees.

399
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,963
He sees machine guns and rifles and
ammunition and some glorious revolution.

400
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,804
What is it you really don't like
about Freddie?

401
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,609
She'll have no life with a
man on the run.

402
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,411
If you can't see that,
you can't see much.

403
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,723
Damn them for what they
did to you in France!

404
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,731
Tell Ada Freddie went to America.

405
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,966
Or Russia.

406
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,804
Polly, it'd do no good for Ada
to bring a baby into the world alone.

407
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,882
Pol, listen. The truth is you would've
hit me with that thing

408
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,008
if it weren't for the fact
that you know I'm right!

409
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,800
Thought] heard someone knocking.

410
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,481
Couldn't get back to sleep.

411
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,324
POLLY: The longer you leave it,

412
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,884
the worse it gets.

413
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,731
Believe me.

414
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,885
I know.

415
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,770
I was 16.

416
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,169
And I didn't dare tell anyone.

417
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,730
Polly, Freddie'll come back.

418
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,364
In the end, I did it myself.

419
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,769
I did it to myself.

420
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,925
And I almost died.

421
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,366
And he didn't come back.

422
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,964
They don't. Why should they?

423
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,044
You know the words.

424
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,361
You're a whore. Baby's a bastard.

425
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,801
But there's no word for the man
who doesn't come back.

426
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,921
One day,

427
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,404
on your wedding day,

428
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,288
you'll have a good man on your arm.

429
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,806
And you'll say, "Polly,

430
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,721
"thank you,

431
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,206
"for common sense."

00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,484
We'll take the train tomorrow.

434
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,044
Go to the castle afterwards for a treat.

435
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,129
I chose this place because

436
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,082
it is outside both of our jurisdictions.

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,888
Inspector, I responded
to your invitation

439
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,644
because I want us
to understand each other.

440
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm a businessman.

441
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,082
I want to make my business successful.

442
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,328
And I want my city run peacefully.

443
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,331
Well, if the city is peaceful,
business can thrive.

444
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,044
So we're on the same side.

445
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,286
I think perhaps we could be.

446
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,726
My...

447
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,520
How can we be on the same side
when I see things like this?

448
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,569
My men found this

449
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,481
in the bedroom

450
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,889
of a known communist.

451
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,884
It has your sister's name on it.

452
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,845
It was obvious she'd been
sleeping in his bed.

453
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,644
Are you also in bed
with the communists, Mr Shelby?

454
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,125
I do not share their fantasy.

455
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,209
And as for my sister,

456
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,084
I've already dealt with the situation.

457
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,687
Freddie Thorne is at the very top
of my list.

458
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,000
Well, cross him off.

459
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,730
He won't be returning to the city.

460
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,002
I'll make him part of our deal.

461
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,925
What deal?

462
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,489
You and your Specials will leave
my businesses alone from now on.

463
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,649
No more raids into our territory,
no more smashing our pubs.

464
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,405
No more lifting my runners.

465
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,646
You will turn a blind eye
to all of my gambling operations. Also,

466
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,286

467
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,405

468
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,122
I intend to do business
with Billy Kimber.

469
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,845
He runs most of the legal trackside
betting outside of London.

470
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,450
He has policemen on his payroll.

471
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,847
I want you to put in a word with
the Chief Inspector of Gloucestershire,

472
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,562
that his men should leave me alone

00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,283
Forgive me, I don't seem to have a pen

475
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,650
to write down this rather
long list of demands.

476
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,965
And what do I get in return?

477
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,531
I have what you're looking for.

478
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,085
I have the guns.

479
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,561
What guns?

480
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,883
- I'm not here to play games.
-Wait, wait...

481
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,571
Twenty five Lewis machine guns.
Fifty carbines.

482
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,962
Ten thousand rounds of ammunition.

483
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,162
All in a crate bound for Libya.

00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,927
Stolen from the BSA
factory proofing bay.

485
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,565
I'm guessing they sent you to Birmingham
to get those guns back.

486
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,605
Well,

487
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,166
it's me that has them.

488
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,842
I have left word with men l trust,

489
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,605
that if I am taken into police custody
for whatever reason,

490
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,804
those guns will be shipped to Liverpool.

491
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,687
From there, they will be sent
directly to Belfast.

492
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,765
And sold to the Irish Republican Army.

493
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,168

will be undone.

is numbered and marked.

If I sell them to the IRA, it won't
be long before Mr Churchill finds out.

496
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,526
I imagine you got into enough trouble

over the burning
of the King's photographs.

498
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,046
That was just a taster.

499
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,689
If those guns reach Belfast,

500
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,128
your life in the force is over.

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
When I have achieved
what I have set out to achieve,

502
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,524
I will let you know where
to find the guns.

503
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,561
You'll be a hero.

504
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,883
You'll probably get a medal.

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,641

506
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,961
It's a fair offer.

507
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,686
Do we have a deal?

00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,920

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,961
Right now.

510
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,961
Very well.

511
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,204
But I'd prefer if we don't
shake hands on it.

512
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,043
Now, why would I shake the hand of a man

513

706
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,041
So now you have my undivided attention.

707
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,931
By the way, which one am I talking to?
Who's the boss?

708
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,682
- Well, I'm the oldest.
-Ha! Clearly. (CHUCKLES)

709
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,730
Are you laughing at my brother?

710
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,007
Right. He's the oldest.
You're the thickest.

711
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,560
I'm told the boss is called Tommy,
and I'm guessing that's you,

712
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,722
'cause you're looking me up and down
like I'm a fucking tart.

713
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,130
I want to know what you want.

714
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,721
There were suspicious betting patterns
at Kempton Park.

715
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,165
A horse called Monaghan Boy...

716
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,961
He won by a length twice
and then finished last.

717
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,564
With £3,000 bet on him.

718
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,445
Which one am I talking to?

719
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,770
- Which one of you is the boss?
-I'm Mr Kimber's adviser and accountant.

720
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,963
And I'm the fucking boss, okay?
Right. End of parlay.

721
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,361
You fixed the race
without my permission.

722
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,126
You fucking gypsy scum!

723
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,211
What, live off the war pensions and
these poor old Garrison Lane widows?

724
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,088
That's your level. I am Billy Kimber!
I run the races

725
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,767
and you fixed one of them. So I'm
gonna have you shot against the post.

726
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,766
Mr Kimber.

727
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,401
Look at it.

728
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,480
That has my name in it.

729
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,001
It's from the Lee family.

730
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,531
You are also at war with the Lees,
Mr Kimber, am I right?

731
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,240
The Lees are attacking your bookies
and taking your money.

732
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,643
Your men can't control them.
You need help.

733
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,921
Perhaps we should listen to what
Mr Shelby has to say,

734
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,526
before we make our decisions.

735
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,047
Right. The Lees

736
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,810
are doing a lot of talking at the fairs.

737
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,245
They have a lot of kin.

738
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,322
They're saying the racetracks
are easy meat

739
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,006
because the police are busy
with strikes. Now,

740
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,960
we have connections.
We know how they operate.

741
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,887
You have muscle.

742
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,080
Together we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

743
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,440
Mr Kimber, perhaps we should take
some time for reflection.

744
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,845
Possibly make arrangements
for a second meeting.

745
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,125
I admire you, Mr Kimber.

746
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,006
You started with nothing
and built a legitimate business.

747
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,085
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

748
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,371
Nobody works "with" me.
People work "for" me.

749
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,686
Pick it up, pikey.

750
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,290
Sit. Sit down.

751
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,006
It's for your ceiling.

752
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,041
Thank you, Mr Kimber.

753
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,601
We will be at Cheltenham.

754
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,001
As will I.

755
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,567
(EXHALES)

756
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,328
So you picked a fight with the Lee's
on purpose.

757
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,801
Tommy, we can't mess with
Billy fucking Kimber.

758
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,242
Get yourself a decent haircut, man.

759
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,880
We're going to the races.

760
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:35,209
