and my name together.

side by side?

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,724
Scudboat and Lovelock
got back from Belfast last night.

177
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,247
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

178
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,521
They were in a pub on the
Shankhill Road yesterday,

179
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,604
and in that pub there was a copper.

180
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,244
Handing out these.

181
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,805
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

182
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,650
They're recruiting Protestant Irishmen
to come over here as Special.

183
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,280
- To do what?
-To clean up the city, Ada.

184
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,206
He's the Chief Inspector.

185
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,927
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

186
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,850
How do you know so bloody much?

187
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,328
'Cause I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

188
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,041
And why didn't you tell me?

189
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,361
I'm telling you.

190
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,410
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

191
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,166
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA.

192
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,925
And the Austin works, lately.

193
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,729
Now the papers
are talking about sedition.

194
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,521
And revolution.

195
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,010
I reckon it's communists he's after.

196
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,528
So this copper's gonna
leave us alone, right?

197
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,569
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away from him.

198
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,044
They say Catholic men who crossed him
used to disappear in the night.

199
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,401
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.

200
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,770
We bloody fought for the King.

201
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,131
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.

202
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,800
We're not scared of coppers.

203
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,689
- He's right.
-If they come for us,

204
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,370
we'll cut them a smile each.

205
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,650
So, Arthur. Is that it?

206
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,325
ARTHUR:
What do you think, Aunt Poll?

207
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,650
This family does everything open.

208
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,243
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

209
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,161
No.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,365
Nothing that's women's business.

211
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,642
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business

212
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,370
while you boys were away at war.

213
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,361
What's changed?

214
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,641
We came back.

215
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,091
And the lord will smite the unholy

216
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,844
when the great judgement comes.

217
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,402
And judgement is coming, my friends.

218
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,923
Judgement is coming to this wicked city.

219
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,528
And your wickedness
and your fornication will be revealed.

You cannot hide from the Creator.

221

You cannot hide
from the Almighty himself.

The Creator sees all.

223

You cannot hide
from the true and living God.

An explanation.

when you're hiding something.

Some of them work at the BSA.

235
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,328
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

236
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,529
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

237
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,682
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

238
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,361
Speak.

239
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,563
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

240
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,564
It was meant to be routine.

241
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,171
I had a buyer in London
for some motorcycles.

242
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,722
I asked my men to steal me four bikes
with petrol engines.

243
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,089
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

245
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,922
<i>They picked up the wrong fucking crate.</i>

246
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,324
<i>The bays dropped it
at Charlie Strong's yard, as agreed.</i>

247
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,370
<i>Must have taken it from the
proofing bay, instead of the export bay.</i>

Holy sweet baby of Mary.

249
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,251
Inside we found 25 Lewis machine guns,

250
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,889
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

251
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,090
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

252

253
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,881
All bound for Libya.

Sitting right there
in Charlie Strong's yard.

255
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,891
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

256
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,209
We put them in the stables
out of the rain.

257
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,407
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

258
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,523
So that's why they sent a cop
from Belfast?

259
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,291
Maybe, maybe not.

260
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,282
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man.

261
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,930
You're not a fool.

262
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,844
You sell those guns to anyone who has
use to them, you will hang.

into the wrong hands,

266
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,809

-No.

They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

277
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,322
I'm not in the mood
for the pictures tonight, Ada.

278
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,290
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,487
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

281
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,444
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

282
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,008
They have friends everywhere,
we'd have to walk to London.

283

I'm with you 'cause you're the
only man round here not scared of them.

Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

285
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,207
But you love me
more than you fear them, right?

286
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,002

always sneaking about.

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,727

-When?

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,160
Those of you who have taken their
bribes these years since the war.

352
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,724
Those of you who look the other way.

353
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,009
You are worse than them!

354
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,609
God damn you for soiling your uniforms!

355
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,285
And then...
there are the IRA Fenians.

356
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,005
And the communists.

357
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,724
Blacker hearts still.

358
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,929
They feed on the pus
of all this corruption.

359
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,767
Like maggots in a corpse.

360
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,326
And, like maggots, if left to swell
they will eventually swarm like flies

361
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,884
and spread their rotten philosophy
across the country and across the world!

362
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,250
Those then...

363
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,210
are our enemies.

364
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,808
A three-headed beast.

365
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,928
It is my job...

366
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,924
to decapitate each one,
and by God I will do it!

367
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,246
I don't trust any of youse

368
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,521
until you earn my trust.

369
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,490
And that takes some earning.

370
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,001
These are the new men
who will bolster your ranks.

371
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,611
Good men,

372
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,690
from God-fearing families.

373
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,725
By the time the sun sets...

374
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,121
they will be sworn in
and in uniform.

375
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,886
And by sunrise tomorrow
they will be on the streets.

376
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,601
God help those who stand in our way!

377
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,206
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

378
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,161
Right.

379
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,965
WOMAN:
Move out of the way for Mr Shelby.

380
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,565
- This way.
-Mr Shelby.

381
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,241
You see, ladies,
when you're out with a Blinder

382
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,526
you don't have to queue.

383
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,761
Right.

384
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,446
I want a blow job off both of you
before they let the ordinary people in.

385
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,849
Away you go.
Take your hat off.

386
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,360
What the fuck!

387
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,009
Who the fuck are you?

388
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,207
I'm Arthur fucking Shelby!

389
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,321
Arthur Shelby.

390

391

393
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,325

(COUGHS)

395
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,281
Bastard!

396
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,811
Your uniform?

397
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,210
Terrifying, I'm sure.

398
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,409
- Did he have a gun?
-No gun.

399
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,122
Knife in his sock.
Cosh in his belt.

400
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,246
Now, Mr Shelby,

401
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,325
I want you to see this
as me introducing myself to you,

402
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,402
you understand.

403
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,927
In all the world,
the only thing that interests me

404
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,325
is the truth.

405
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,684
What do you know about the robbery?

406
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,086
What robbery?

407
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,601
(GROANS)

408
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,243
I will ask you again.

409
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,683
What do you know about the robbery?

410
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,287
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

411
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,768
What fucking robbery?!

412
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
(GROANS LOUDLY)

413
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,648
After 35 years of dealing
with animals like you,

414
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,723
I can tell just by sniffing the air

415
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,643
whether or not you're lying.

416
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,721
I'm not fucking lying, all right?

417
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,689
I'm not fucking lying!

418
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,521
I know.

419
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,568
I see nothing of interest
behind the blood in your eyes.

420
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,009
And no blood in your veins
that could carry...

421
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,607
even a trace of cunning or guile.

422
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,649
But understand this.

423
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,887
It is well within my power

424
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,451
to have you
and the rest of your scum family

425
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,889
face down in the canal
before the year is out.

426
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,924
On the other hand...

427
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,529
we can help each other.

428
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,684
Is it always this busy in the day time?

429
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,286
Nah, these boys
are on their way to St Andrews.

430
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,687
- To pray?
-(LAUGHS) That'll be the day!

431
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,525
St Andrews is a football ground.
The Blues are playing.

432
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,005
That's the forward line there,

433
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,929
and that's the goalie,
believe it or not.

434
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,761
Hello!

435
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,290
I need a bottle of rum.

436
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,568
Grace, whatever it is,
it's on the house.

437
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,320
- A whole bottle?
-Yeah.

438
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,170
- White or dark rum?
-Don't care.

439
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,288
HARRY: Right, lads, what' ll it be? Two?

440
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,485
Thank you.

441
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,807
Harry said it's on the house.

442
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,361
Are you a whore?

443
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,608
'Cause if you're not,
you're in the wrong place.

444
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,690
He's one of them you warned me about.

445
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,889
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl,
but be careful.

446
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,680
If l say something's on the house,

447
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,444
then say nothing
to whoever you're serving.

448
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,763
If they decide that they want you,

449
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,320
then there's nothing
anybody could do about it.

450
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,961
Lucky for you,
since he got back from France

451
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,844
Tommy doesn't want anybody at all.

452
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,201

-I bloody am.

458
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,686
You went to one first aid class
in the church hall

459
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,091
and got thrown out for giggling.

460
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,561
Not before I learned
how to stop somebody from choking.

461
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,244
I'm not bloody choking, am I?

462

465
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,721

TOMMY: You're all right.

468
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,447
He said Mr Churchill sent him
to Birmingham.

469
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,891
National interest, he said.

470
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,444
Something about a robbery.

471
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,044
He said he wants us to help him.

472
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,121
We don't help coppers.

473
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,967
He knew all about our war records.

474
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,170
He said we're patriots.

475
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,086

476
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,083

(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

529
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,845
- They're gonna kill me!
-I said, go home.

530
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,803
Big spiders!

531
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,605

(PEOPLE SHOUTING IN ITALIAN)

533
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,883
Secretary of State,
this is Chief Inspector Campbell.

534
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,890
Mr Churchill, sir.

535
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,082
May I say what a great honour it is
to meet you.

536
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,607
Bit of a whistle-stop tour.

537
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,526
- Love the hat, by the way.
-Thank you.

538
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,481
It's beaver.

539
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,647
So, how are you settling in?

540
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,645
I've set up a command network.

541
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,127
I've agents in place across the city,

542
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,050
who will act as my eyes and ears.

543
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,451
And I've begun to interrogate suspects
vigorously.

544
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,324
You were in Belfast.

545
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,810
Understand you broke
a few Fenian hearts.

546
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,246
A rat's nest, sir.

547
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,761
So, who do you think stole the guns?

548
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,644
The Fenians or the communists?

549
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,803
If it is the IRA Fenians,

550
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,841
I will find them and find the guns.

551
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,243
If it is the communists,
I will find them and find the guns.

552
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,962
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

553
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,004
To me, there is no distinction
between any of the above.

554
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,289
Now, I chose you
because you're effective.

555
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,567
But remember this, Mr Campbell -

556
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,722
this is England, not Belfast.

557
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,010
Bodies thrown in the rivers
wash up in the papers here.

558
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,322
You must keep the existence of these
stolen guns out of the news,

559
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,165
otherwise we are simply
advertising them for sale.

560
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,522
If there are bodies to be buried...

561
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,841
dig holes.

562
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,525
And dig them deep.

563
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,169
I want everything accounted for.

564
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,924
Down to the last bullet.

565
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,450
TOMMY: Uncle Charlie.

566
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,045
A word.

567
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,121
Get aboard.

568
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,921
There's no moon.

569
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,686
We can take them out to the
turning point beyond Gas Street

570
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,125
and leave them on the bank.

571
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,451
They'll be found by railwaymen,
first thing.

572
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,921
Is that agreement?

573
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,650
I changed my mind.

574
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,081
You what?

575
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,128
I've an alternative strategy.

576
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,731
Tell Curly to take her out
to the old tobacco wharf.

577
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,891
There's a lock-up mooring
we used to keep cigarettes.

578
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,161
He knows it.

579
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,607
When the boat leaves your yard,
it's no longer your concern.

580
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,208
Have you lost your fucking mind?

581
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,485
Have you not seen the streets?

582
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,126
They've sent a fucking army
to find these things.

583
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,526
That's right.

584
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,040
They've shown their hand.

585
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,687
Their hand?

586
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,331
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

587
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,170
That's the way of the world.

588
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,042
Fortune drops something
valuable into your lap,

589
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,122
you don’t just dump it
on the bank of the cut.

590
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,890
You're blood, Tommy.

591
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,208
I've always looked out for you
like a dad.

592
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,766
You're going to bring
only hell down on your head.

593
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,564
This copper takes no prisoners.

594
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,405
I'm told he didn't serve.

595
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,570
Reserved occupation.

596
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,287
Is it another war
you're looking for, Tommy?

597
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,085
The tobacco wharf.

598
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,848
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

599
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,845
Are you in position?

600
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,206
I am, sir.

601
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,240
First impressions?

602
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,961
I'm quite shocked
at how these people live.

603
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,441
Have you found anything out
that might help me?

604
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,847
I interrogated the head
of the Peaky Blinders.

605
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,926
He didn't know anything.

606
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,521
A brute.

607
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,288
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur
who heads the Shelby family.

608
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,404
It's the younger one.

609
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,761
Thomas.

610
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,486
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

611
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,244
You sound fascinated.

612
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,850
However, my opinion has not changed.

613
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,804
The bookmaker gangs have other business

614
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,326
and the communists
are too weak to have planned this.

615
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,841
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

616
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,844
You must not let your personal history
cloud your judgement.

617
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,641
What history?

618
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,005
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgement.

619
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,965
If you see any guns,

620
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,844
check the serial numbers
against that list.

621
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,760
Your father...

622
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,971
was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

623
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,247
I know he'd be very, very proud of you.

624
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,403
Danny, as you know,
the man you killed was Italian.

625
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,044
Those two men over there
are his brothers.

626
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,809
If l let the Italians do this, Danny,

627
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,327
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

628
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,522
That's how those bastards do things.

629
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,564
So, to stop a war breaking out
between us and the Italians,

630
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,008
to save you from their barbarity,

631
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,965
I said I would dispatch you myself.

632
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,365
They're here to witness.

633
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,287
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

634
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,563
I left my fucking brains in the mud.

635
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,689
Do you have any last requests, comrade?

636
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,246
You look out for my Rosie and my boys.

637
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,765
See they get apprenticeships.

638
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,966
At the BSA factory or the Austin.

639
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,368
And they'll make foremen,
I know they will.

640
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,488
Just...ordinary.

641
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,164
Just ordinary men.

642
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,008
And they won't get told to do this shit.

643
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,482
This shit...
This shit that we got told to do!

644
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,403
(WHIMPERING)

645
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,843
I suppose I ought to pray now.

646
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,290
Those fucking guns,

647
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,642
they blew God right outta me head.

648
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,764
Is that boat for me?

649
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,001
We have to get your body
out of the city, Danny.

650
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,726
This new copper, you know.

651
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,002
Don't bury me anywhere there's mud.

652
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,481
Okay?

653
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,441
Promise me.

654
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,089
Bury me on a hill,

655
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,249
and tell Rosie where.

656
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,404
You're a good man,

657
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,123
and a good soldier.

658
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,443
Yes, Sergeant Major.

659
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,804
In the bleak mid-winter...

660
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,608
ARTHUR: Where are ya?

661
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,371
It bloody won.

662
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,121
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

663
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,041
Yeah. It won.

664
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,005
And word will spread.

665
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,484
So the next time we do the powder trick,

666
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,689
it won't be just a garrison
that'll bet on the horse.

667
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,569
It'll be the whole of Small Heath.

668
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,165
And you know what?

669
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,804
The horse will win again.

670
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,407
And the third time we do it we'll have
the whole of Birmingham betting on it.

671
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,962
A thousand-quid bet on the magic horse.

672
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,690
And that time...

673
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,209
when we are ready...

674
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,645
the horse will lose.

675
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,285
Think about it.

676
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,404
CHARLIE: You okay, Danny?

677
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,641
I'm still in shock.

678
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,331
Are you sure this isn't heaven?

679
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,129
If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

680
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,684
Tommy wanted you to think it was real.

681
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,044
Try and knock some sense into you.

682
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,288
A shell full of sheep brains
hurts pretty bad.

683
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,646
Aye, it was meant to.

684
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,770
So, where are you taking me?

685
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,126
London.

686
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,929
Tommy has a little job for you.

687
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,480
Give you a chance to say thanks.

688
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,209
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

689
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,926
POLLY: Bad week?

690
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,850
Heard there was no moon last night.

691
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,764
- I checked. Did you do the right thing?
- Yes, I did the right thing.
