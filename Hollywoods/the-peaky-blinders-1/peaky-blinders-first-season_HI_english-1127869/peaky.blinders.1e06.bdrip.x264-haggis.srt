00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,284
They were three and five years old.

186
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,089
Sally was three, Michael was five,
well, two weeks away from being six.

187
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,525
It was Sunday morning,

188
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,251
I was at church...

189
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,605
"You're not forgiven."

190
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,921
This...

191
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,281
Pinched-faced bitch said to me,
"You're not forgiven."

192
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,884
You see, some sheets I'd
washed and hung on the line

193
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,928
had the name of a hotel in them.

194
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,331
They'd been stolen in a robbery,

195
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,529
and they said some porter
at the hotel had been coshed.

196
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,611
And a woman from around here
told the police about the sheets.

197
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,201
Jealous, you see, about the new sheets.

198
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,891
And when the police came,

199
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,567
they found a spirits still.

200
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,482
Making a few drops of gin.

201
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,601
And for that...

202
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,608
(CRYING) They took my children from me.

203
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,562
And they never told me
where they took them.

204
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,043
And they did it 'cause they could,
and 'cause I was weak.

205
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,121
They will never take your
baby away from you.

206
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,881
Do you know why?

207
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,963
'Cause Tommy won't let them.

208
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,841
'Cause Tommy won't let
them walk all over us.

209
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,843
Now, it is Tommy that has brought
strength and power to this family.

210
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,607
'Cause he knows...

211
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,650
You have to be as bad as them
above in order to survive.

212
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,523
I'm telling you this because
I want you to forgive him.

213
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,766
How can I?

214
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,248
When my Freddie's rotting
in jail because of him.

215
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,842
There's something about
today you need to know.

216
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,688
POLICEMAN: All right, Freddie.
Time to go.

217
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,410
I want to get a message to Campbell.

218
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,601
(SIGHS)

219
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,284
I can't let them move me to Brixton.

220
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,607
If l go to Brixton, they'll kill me.

221
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,241
Freddie...

222
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,763
You're not going to get as
far as Brixton prison.

223
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,521
You're free.

224
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,524
CHURCHILL: I told
the Prime Minister personally

225
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,204
that the guns have been retrieved,

226
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,044
and he actually heard me and listened,

227
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,481
and I'm pretty sure he
gave me a half smile.

228
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,928
He never usually smiles unless
a political opponent dies.

229
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,126
(CHUCKLES)

230
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,207
I've plan to put your name
forward in the New Year's Honours List.

231
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,969
- That would be too much, sir.
-Nonsense.

232
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,361
You deserve it.

233
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,165
As I recall, you wrote to me several
times about an undercover operative,

234
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,321
a WOMEN.

235
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,882
Was she involved in the discovery?

236
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,966
Does she deserve some
kind of commendation?

237
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,841
Yes.

238
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,084
She was instrumental.

239
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,961
A truly loyal servant to the Crown.

240
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,482
And that is what the
record should state.

241
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,491
And what of the men who actually
stole the guns? The Peaky...

242
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,207
Blinders, sir.

243
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,925
If we were to make arrests,

244
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,570
the whole thing would end up in
open court, and I know we wish to

245
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,210
keep this matter confidential.

246
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,200
So they' ll go free?

247
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,641
Not quite, sir.

248
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,811
See, I have plans

249
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
for the Peaky Blinders.

250
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,127
All right?

251
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,290
(EXCITED CONVERSATION)

252
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,644
POLLY: Leave that, boys,
we'll get back to it later.

253
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,846
TOMMY: Right.

254
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,445
We've brought you all here today

255
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,209
'cause this is the day
we replace Billy Kimber.

256
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,921
This is the day we become respectable.

257
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,164
The day we join the official National
Association of Racecourse Bookmakers.

258
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,086
But, first,

259
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,921
we do the dirty work.

260
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,688
Now, you've all known
this day's been coming,

261
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,285
I just haven't told anyone the date.

262
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,289
We're going to the Worcester races.

263
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,722
Track opens at 1:00,
we get there at 2:00.

264
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,005
Now, Kimber thinks we're going there
to help him fight the Lee brothers.

265
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,929
Thanks to the efforts of our john

266
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,409
and his lovely new wife, Esme,

267
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,687
the Lees are now our kin.

268
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,841
I interrupted those efforts this morning
and, uh,

269
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,766
I can assure you all,
john is making great sacrifices

270
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,970
in the cause of peace.

271
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,087
Yeah, all right.

272
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,967
So it'll be us and the Lees against
Kimber's boys.

273
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,160
We take 'em out and leave the bookies.

274
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,202
I'll expect a swift victory which will
send a signal all the way to London

275
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,525
that we believe in letting legitimate
businesses run peacefully.

276
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,409
JOHN:
And, uh, what about Kimber himself?

277
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,805
I'll deal with Kimber.

278
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,481
Any other questions?

279
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,641
Yes.

280
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,445
Does anyone object if I bring
a newcomer to the meeting?

281
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,321
(WHISPERING) Come on.

282
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,640
I'd like to introduce the newest member
of the Shelby clan.

283
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,369
(APPLAUSE)

284
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,166
Welcome home, Ada.

285
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,967
We named him Karl.

286
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,041
After Karl Marx.

287
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,091
Karl bloody Marx.

288
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,446
Let me get a look at him.

289
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,760
Oh, here we go.

290
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,167
ARTHUR: Hey, look!

291
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,649
He looks just like me, look!

292
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,280
- MAN: Unless his arse looks like you.
-ARTHUR: He's all right.

293
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,081
He's a Shelby.

294
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,881
Well, Ada...

295
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,925
Am I forgiven?

296
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,763
If what Aunt Polly says is true,
you are.

297
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,841
It's true.

298
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,126
(SIGHS)

299
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,081
Thank you, Tommy.

300
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,440
THORNE: So who the hell are you?

301
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,724
POLICEMAN:
Someone who wants to keep his eyes.

302
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,365
They came to my house,

303
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,487
told me to volunteer for this.

304
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,807
Who did?

305
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,001
The Peaky Blinders.

306
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,489
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

307
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,681
POLICEMAN 1: Get out of the way!

308
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,361
THORNE: What the bloody hell is that?

309
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,210
Looks like your friends are here.

310
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,364
Stay down on the ground!
Or the next one's for you.

311
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,601
Oh!

312
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,966
POLICEMAN 2: Make it look good.

313
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,448
I am sorry about this, comrade.

314
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,081
Holy shit!

315
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,251
- Danny, you're dead!
-No. I've been living in London.

316
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,446
Same thing.

317
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,321
In you get.

318
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,926
All right, lads, listen up.

319
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,368
You have a pint and a chaser,
no more, on the house.

320
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,684
Right. Let's get pouring.

321
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,484
Do you have the enclosure tickets?

322
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,449
And the registered bookkeepers
on the track?

323
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,921
In me coat.

324
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,891
You did a good job, Grace.

325
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,001
- Much.
-Much.

326
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,805
(CLEARS THROAT)

327
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,531
Next family meeting,

328
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,246
I'll make sure you're there.

329
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,841
If l were family.

330
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,845
But I'm not.

331
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,281
That could change.

332
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,085
- Tommy...
-We'll talk about it more

333
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,650
when I get back, all right?

334
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,767
When will you be back?

335
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,963
Oh, is this how it's gonna be, eh?

336
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,690
You waiting at home for me,

337
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,531
saying, "What time do you call this?'

338
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,850
The barrel needs changing.

339
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Go on, Tom. Go out the back,
give her a good seeing to before we go.

340
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,407
All right?

341
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,202
Hey, Grace, I was joking.

342
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,131
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-MAN: Tommy, we need more mild.

343
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,009
Just help yourselves!

344
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,726
Tommy, the truth is...

345
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,164
When you come back from the races,
I won’t be here.

346
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,081
What are you talking about?

347
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,446
All right, look.

348
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,364
Grace, I know you weren't born
to be with a man like me.

349
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,450
But I'm turning things around.

350
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,647
When I get back here tonight,
I will have

351
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,490
one of the biggest legal race track
syndicates in the country.

352
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,971
I'm gonna close down
some of that other stuff.

353
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,406
Maybe open a club.

354
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,644
Hey, back in London.

355
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,366
And another thing,

356
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,884
you have a contract of employment.

357
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,081
With a real limited company.

358
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,761
You remember?

359
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,970
I remember everything, Tommy.

360
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,970
I'am going to a make a success of this.

361
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,044
I'am going to a make a success of it.

362
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,601
- I am.
-I know.

363
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,366
I know.

364
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,644
I'm not talking about marriage.

365
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,721
I'm so...

366
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,641
We know each other.

367
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,281
We can talk.

368
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,281
We're the same.

369
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,129
Tommy,
I've done something terrible to you.

370
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,521
Right. Tell him what you just told me.

371
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,128
Just heard there's two vans driving up
the Stratford Road.

372
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,687
JEREMIAH: An old corporal of mine said
he recognised some of the men.

373
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,091
He said it's the Kimber boys.

374
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,521
And they're heading this way.

375
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,727
(DOOR SLAMS)

376
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,926
TOMMY: Ada! Wake up!

377
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,890
You and the baby, get into the bullring
where there's lots of people.

378
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,167
- What's going on?
-We've been fucking betrayed.

379
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,886
Someone let slip.
Kimber's men are on their way here.

380
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,601
- Yeah, but you can handle them, Tommy.
-TOMMY: It's just us.

381
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,041
All the Lees are on their way to
Worcester, we're outnumbered.

382
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,641
(SCREAMING) Fuck!

383
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,451
Who else knew today was the day
you were moving on Kimber?

384
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,201
You said you kept it a secret.
Who else did you tell?

385
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,326
There's only one thing can blind
a man as smart as you, Tommy.

386
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,247
Love.

387
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,601
It's that barmaid.

388
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,244
POLLY: I'll deal with Grace.

389
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,651
If you set eyes on her again,
you might kill her.

390
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,046
POLLY: Going for good?

391
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,401
GRACE: I heard there was trouble.

392
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,724
Instinct's a funny thing.

393
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,091
See, normally I can tell about a person,
but with you...

394
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,929
Look, the fighting's about to begin.

395
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,362
- We should get out of here.
-We know who you are.

396
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,086
Tommy knows as well.

397
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,401
Turned out that copper as good as
told him this morning.

398
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,847
But I wanted to hear it
from your own lips.

399
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,449
I'am an agent of the Crown.

400
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,928
I have the power to arrest
and the right to use force.

401
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,044
So please, step out of my way.

402
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,841
Like I say, instinct's a funny thing.
You fell for Tommy for real, didn't you?

403
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
This gun is loaded.

404
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,806
I'm not afraid of you.

405
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
I feel sorry for you.

406
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,286
Slip of a thing.

407
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,163
Thought you'd come in here and stitch us
all up.

408
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,971
I mean, we've had some copper's narks
in here, but you...

409
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,921
You're the queen of them all.

410
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,001
So who are you?

411
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,525
Rich girl, I'd guess.

412
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,883
Unionist. Ulster Volunteer.

413
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,804
You thought, "Fenians, communists,
low people...

414
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,689
"They're all the same. Scum."

415
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,961
Then you met Tommy.

416
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,284
I'll fight you with my fists
and show you how a rich girl fights.

417
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,890
I'm from a tough family, too.

418
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,486
Nah.

419
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,170
We women have more sense.

420
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,605
Why don't you pour us both a drink?

421
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,161
So am I right?

422
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,645
Did you fall for Tommy?

423
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,641
Yes, I did.

424
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,166
Then I pity you.

425
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,170
You think he'll try to kill me?

426
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,321
That's too soft.

427
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,925
- Soft?
- Soft?

428
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,007
Like you.

429
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,768
You saved his life the night
the coppers came.

430
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,203
That's why we're drinking, not fighting.

431
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,966
We owe you.

432
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,286
What was he like?

433
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,721
Before France?

434
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,046
He laughed. A lot.

435
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,804
He wanted to work with horses.

436
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,441
He won medals?

437
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,601
Threw them in the cut.

438
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,447
Not a single man came back the same.

439
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,770
You know, after all this is over,

440
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,721
he might forgive you.

441
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,681
He might take you in.

442
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,121
Can never tell with men.

443
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,288
They go for whoever their dicks point at
and there's no changing their minds.

444
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,846
But I should tell you something.

445
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,405
I will never forgive you.

446
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,530
Or accept you.

447
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,527
Or take you in.

448
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,091
And it's me who runs the business
of the heart in this family.

449
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,564
And as far as I'm concerned,

450
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,329
you're a snitch from the parish.

451
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,842
And if you're not gone from this city
by tomorrow,

452
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,766
I'll kill you myself.

453
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,041
Now go.

454
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,329
Maybe what really upsets you

455
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,928
is the thought that one day
you might lose him.

456
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,251
Tommy! We've had word
from Nipper at Hay Mills,

457
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,606
and he says
the police are letting them through.

458
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,570
And how come all our police
have disappeared?

459
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,291
'Cause it was the police who told
Kimber about the plan.

460
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,521
And who told the police?

461
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,400
You know what, john?
For all I think I'm the smart one,

462
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,323
I'm guessing it was me.

463
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,281
TOMMY: All right, men.

464
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,688
You were mostly in the war, so you know
that battle plans always change

465
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,922
and get fucked up, well here it is.

466
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,605
Things have changed.

467
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,929
We fight them here. Today. Alone.

468
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,730
Now, they're gonna come for the pub,

469
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,922
they're gonna try
and break us up for good.

470
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,481
And we'll have no help
from 'the law today.

471
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,287
That pub there is called The Garrison!

472
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,965
Well, now it really is one.

473
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,527
And it belongs to us! Right?

474
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,965
ALL: Right!

475
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,121
How many are there?

476
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,288
Jeremiah said two Reilly vans.

477
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,208
So I reckon we're outnumbered
three to one.

478
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,361
ARTHUR: Ah, fuck.

479
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,966
But it's us, boys, it's us!

480
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,122
The Small Heath rifles.

481
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,164
Never lost a fight yet, did we?

482
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,605
- ALL: No!
-All right!

483
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,242
Jeremiah, I know you vowed to God
to never pick up a weapon again.

484
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,688
But can you ask him from me
if you can help us today.

485
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,042
God says he done a deal
with Small Heath, sir.

486
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,246
Good man!

487
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,243
Arthur, Scudboat, you take the flanks.

488
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,606
- Just like at St Marie.
-Sure.

489
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,727
Curly.

490
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,928
If any Shelby man dies here today,

491
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,129
you bury us side by side.

492
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,646
All right. We've about ten minutes.

493
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,285
Make your peace with whoever.

494
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,569
MOSS: We've heard a report
of a large group of men

495
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,642
in vehicles heading towards the city.

496
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,484
Most of them are
known to the police, sir.

497
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,282
Uh. We think a gang fight's
about to break out.

498
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,247
CAMPBELL: I want all officers
and constables

499
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,209
stood down in the following areas.

500
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,041
Bordesley,

501
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,561
Small Heath, Shard End, Greet,

502
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,164
-and Hay Mills.
-Stood down, sir?

503
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,368
Immediately.
And the vehicles approaching the city

504
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,125
-should not be impeded.
-What the hell is going on?

505
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,325
Let dog eat dog.

506
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,247
Let the beasts devour each other.

507
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,848
And then we shall pick the bones.

508
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,601
HARRY: She's gone, then?

509
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,645
You're not accustomed to not getting
what you want, are you, Tommy?

510
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,048
You wanted my pub, and you took it.

511
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,449
You got a fair price.

512
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,087
What I got was an ultimatum.

513
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,285
Like you give to everybody.

514
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,250
Do it, or else.

515
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,449
And yet, it's funny,

516
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,047
everybody around here,
they want you to win this battle.

517
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,081
I think what it is,

518
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,968
you're bad men, but you're our bad men.

519
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,401
Will you go looking for her?

520
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,321
She's in the past.

521
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,805
The past is not my concern.

522
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,441
The future is no longer
my concern either.

523
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,090
What is your concern, Tommy?

524
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,001
TOMMY: One minute.

525
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,409
TOMMY: <i>The soldier's minute.</i>

526
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,771
In a battle, that's all you get.

527
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,083
One minute of everything at once.

528
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,324
Anything before is nothing.

529
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,481
Everything after,

530
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,801
nothing.

531
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,605
Nothing in comparison

532
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,046
to that one minute.

533
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,249
HARRY: Didn't you get enough minutes
over there?

534
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,491
Seems not, doesn't it?

535
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,761
(DOOR OPENS)

536
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,606
