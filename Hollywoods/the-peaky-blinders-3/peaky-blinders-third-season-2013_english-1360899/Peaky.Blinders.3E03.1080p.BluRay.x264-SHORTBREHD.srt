1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,721
<i>Until further notice,
no fraternising with the foreigners.</i>

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,202
My son will walk
with any woman in this city.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,402
It would be hard for your son
to walk anywhere

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,005
with a bullet in each knee.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,170
You said you wanted peace at home.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,571
Now, we go on the offensive.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,529
<i>A woman of substance and class.</i>

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,647
And I've painted many women.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,926
There'll be no charge.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,767
The name I've heard is Section D.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,491
MPs, army officers...

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,847
When all we're trying to do
is save the country from revolution.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,164
This is for the killing of the spy
and a down payment on future services.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,887
Does your wife know
that the sapphire she is wearing

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,007
has been cursed?

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,481
Nothing on Earth would make me wear it.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,403
For Angel!

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,926
He's back.

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,970
Was he out there all night?

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,324
Every night since the funeral.

22
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,525
Comes back in the morning to see Charles
and feed the horses,

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,841
and when it gets dark,
he goes off again.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,363
He used to sleep out when he was a kid.

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,729
Curly would find him in the pasture.

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,245
How's the baby?

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,409
He asks for him mum at night.

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,131
Tommy made a list.

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,850
He wants to see you two first.

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,207
What about John and Arthur?

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,481
How are the books?

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,281
Unaffected.

33
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,645
Up slightly.

34
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,807
There's also been a threefold increase
in donations

35
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,769
to the Shelby Foundation charity.

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,245
The counsellor suggested naming the
new school "The Grace Shelby Institute."

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,487
Tell the counsellor the name "Grace
Shelby Institute" is acceptable to us.

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,967
This is a list on the other things
I want doing.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,641
That's all.

40
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,085
- Tommy.
- That's all, Pol.

41
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,210
Well done, both of you.

42
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,689
Right, let's go.

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,966
Uh, we've already seen him.

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,441
He wanted to see people
in a particular order.

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,448
I can normally read him, but he's
difficult to read, so be careful.

46
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,247
I thought it was
a fucking family meeting.

47
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,084
All of us together, I thought.

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,491
John, he's grieving.

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,767
To see everyone together
would be too much.

50
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,607
Yeah, well... Come on, John.

51
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,049
Arthur, we need him back.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,210
Sabini and Solomons have already sent
condolences and flowers,

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,329
so it won't be long before they come
trotting up the A1 like wolves.

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,050
Go on. There's a timetable.

55
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,091
Only good news.

56
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,209
There is only good news, Polly.

57
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,487
Who we fucking now?

58
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,284
Well, there he is.

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,721
Hi, Tom.

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,286
Hello, boys.

61
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,851
We, uh, didn't get a chance to see you
after the funeral.

62
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,969
Well, you disappeared on us, but, well,
me and John, we just wanna say that...

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,087
Arthur, shut up.

64
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,286
All right.

65
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,045
All right, talk to me.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,085
We got to Angel at the hospital
where he laid. Cut his throat.

67
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,281
He's dead.

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,442
Cleared out the rest of the Italians
out of the south of the city.

69
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,931
They mostly went to
the Black Country,

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,889
but we told Betty Kitchins
to keep her moving.

71
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,405
And Betty sends her condolences.

72
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,845
What about the old man?

73
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,085
We interrogated his boys.

74
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,685
Yeah, he went to Liverpool.

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,489
He's waiting
for an immigrant ship to New York.

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,925
When?

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,650
Berthed ship sails Saturday.

78
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,687
All right, I have contacts,
people in Cunard and Liverpool.

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,527
They'll have passenger lists.

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,728
They can get you into the point
of departure.

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,484
You pick him up,
and you bring him to me.

82
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,931
Who's he got travelling with him?

83
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,329
- His wife.
- What?

84
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,520
His wife.

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,364
So shoot her, and bring him to me.

86
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,805
Uh, Tommy, Mrs Changretta
was a teacher at our school.

87
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,611
She's a good woman, Tom, a good woman.

88
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,610
Well, if she's a good woman,
then she'll go to heaven, eh, Arthur?

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,363
just do what's on the list,
nothing else. Then burn it.

90
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,922
Don't speak on the phones.
The fucking Secret Service is listening.

91
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,005
I want the old man alive.
I wanna do it myself.

92
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,930
That's it.  You can go.

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,165
Come, John.

94
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,928
Tommy, if you haven't got a bird here,
you're gonna have to tell us something.

95
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,531
Ask Polly.

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,606
Not Michael?

97
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,081
What?

98
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,845
- Not Michael, no?
- No.

99
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,890
Not Michael, no. 'Cause
Michael deals with legitimate business.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,206
You saw him before us.

101
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,647
John, not now.

102
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,241
Wait, what did you say?

103
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,522
You saw Michael before us!

104
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,840
Fuck's sake, John.

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,449
Because legitimate business, John,
is the priority.

106
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,727
- Legitimate business...
- Since when?

107
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,567
Since my fucking wife took a bullet
meant for me.

108
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,771
Oh, yeah. OK.

109
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,491
Yeah, so Secret Service.
Secret fucking Service...

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,211
Blah, blah, blah.
But you don't tell us shit.

111
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,931
We're a couple of fucking toy soldiers.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,766
"Do this, John. Do that, John.
Kill your fucking teacher, John!"

113
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,931
This is how it's gonna be.

114
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,762
All right, listen to me.
There's gonna be a little war

115
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,969
in a little place
that no one gives a fuck about.

116
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,563
And the side that is gonna lose
needs a little bit of help.

117
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,444
And they're willing to pay.

118
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,845
When that business is done,
legitimate business is the priority.

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,208
Now, do what's on the list and fuck off.

120
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,362
When are you coming back, hmm?

121
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,406
I'm back, Arthur.

122
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,362
- John, you're just as young.
- Cheers.

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,649
The thing is, we all naturally came
in here, where the servants eat.

124
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,121
It's nothing to do
with politics, Ada.

125
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,009
It's fucking freezing in the big room.

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,128
John, mind your language
in front of Carl.

127
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,964
Ada, we're in the servants' quarters

128
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,884
because it's where the fucking booze
is kept.

129
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,122
- Arthur, find better words!
- Yes.

130
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,009
Pol, does swearing in Gypsy count?

131
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,448
That's no reason for us to be speaking
Shelta in any case.

132
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,328
I'm just saying there is no need.

133
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,411
When she's drunk,
my wife can't speak fucking English.

134
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,925
John!
- Fucking right!

135
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,131
You dealt with it?

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,407
Incentives, no threats.

137
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,962
Implied consequences without
specific reference to physical harm.

138
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,404
That's why young Michael is the boss.

139
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,765
He knows better words, right, Pol?

140
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,490
Since when was I your boss, Arthur?

141
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,882
First, the boss meets you.
Then the workers meet you.

142
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,201
When did either of you two
do a day's work?

143
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,850
In the old days, Finn,

144
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,486
family meetings
used to be all of us together.

145
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,005
Arthur, shut up.

146
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,085
Now, me and John,

147
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,247
we're just fucking bin men
whose duty it is to obey.

148
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,681
Hmm?

149
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,331
Mrs Changretta.

150
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,285
Arthur, shut up.
Finn, go and get us cigars.

151
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,200
So what are we gonna do
all night, eh? Climb fucking trees?

152
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,930
John, stop swearing
in front of the kids.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,650
Yeah, and who said
you're staying the night?

154
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,131
I know what we can do.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,570
We get the guns out, John.

156
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,562
We go outside,
and we shoot some fucking pheasants.

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,609
- That's what the bosses do, isn't it?
- Yeah.

158
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,886
Fuck off, Arthur.

159
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,965
Fuck you just say to me?

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,401
I didn't ask for separate meetings
today, all right?

161
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,124
No. No, what the fuck did you just say?

162
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,960
'Cause I didn't fucking hear you right.

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,042
I didn't ask for separate meetings
today, all right?

164
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,561
Fucking pheasant.

165
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,526
Carl!

166
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,530
You can't say things like that.

167
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,762
Now look what you've done.

168
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,605
All right, brothers.

169
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,404
It's just the fucking whisky talking.

170
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,403
I don't ask to be protected, all right?

171
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,041
Right. Shut up.
The pair of you, sit down!

172
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,371
Sit down!

173
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,529
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Look around you.

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,091
And look at this house.

175
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,970
Look where we are.

176
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,327
Look how far we've come.

177
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,482
I think it's about time
we all started acting

178
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,767
in a way more appropriate
to our station.

179
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,248
We're none of us bin men any more,
Arthur.

180
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,530
Tommy needs us all together.

181
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,129
I'd like to propose a toast.

182
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,121
It's a family united
that shall never be defeated.

183
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,962
Tommy's gone. Swear to God,
he's in a wagon with johnny Dogs.

184
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,761
Shit.

185
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,685
This is what he does now.

186
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,168
- Tommy! Wait!
- Arthur!

187
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,890
- Tommy!
- Arthur, let him go!

188
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,528
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

189
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
Tommy!

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,726
Walk on. Walk on.

191
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,410
- Tommy.
- Walk on.

192
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,764
They're coming out in the drive.

193
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,249
- You're not gonna tell them?
- Tell them what?

194
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,451
That we're going to Wales.

195
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,041
I left a note.

196
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,846
Did you tell them
why we're going to Wales?

197
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,967
No.

198
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,168
At some point you're gonna tell me
why we're going to Wales?

199
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,651
Yeah, when we get there.

200
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,487
Walk on.

201
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,369
Should have brought
at least one woman, Tommy.

202
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,522
Johnny, it's a woman we're going to see.

203
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,931
- There, boy. Walk on. Walk on.
- Right.

204
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,686
Says he'll be back in Birmingham
in three days.

205
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,406
Let him go.

206
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,249
The important thing is,
if he says he'll be back, he'll be back.

207
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,043
Come on.
Let's go light a fire in the big room.

208
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,121
Let's go drink whisky, with water.

209
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,405
See to the horses, johnny.

210
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,051
Aye, Tom.

211
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,205
So we'll go out through Meridian,
then into the Black Mountains.

212
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,450
Here.

213
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,931
Here, give me some.

214
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,887
Boy.

215
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,281
Here you go.

216
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,962
Now, remember last night
when you asked after Mama?

217
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,090
She's gone, Charlie, and there's
a few things we need to get straight.

218
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,325
There's her photographs.

219
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,890
There's her clothes.

220
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,963
I'll keep things the way they are
in the room.

221
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,805
just keep things the way they are.

222
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,287
Here you go.

223
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,448
Yeah. Here you go.

224
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,850
I'm not much good, Charlie.

225
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,441
You'll find that out soon enough.

226
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,127
She's not gonna be coming back,
so it's just you and me.

227
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,570
She'll be with us in our hearts
'cause we love her.

228
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,207
- Tommy.
- Yeah.

229
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,089
This fucking horse of yours
won't come to me.

230
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,083
- All right, I'll be there. All right.
- Huh? Come on.

231
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,929
That was her favourite horse, Charlie,

232
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,688
and he's been all over the place
since she's gone.

233
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,330
- Tom?
- Yeah, you watch him.

234
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,606
I will. Oh, yeah.

235
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,481
Huh?

236
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,483
All right, now cock it with your thumb.

237
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,089
There you go. Now she's been cocked.

238
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,329
She's alive in your hand.

239
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,326
It's like waking up a girl
when you cock that trigger.

240
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,402
She rolls over all sleepy-eyed
and she goes,

241
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,641
"Michael. Michael."

242
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,842
"What are you gonna make me do,
Michael?"

243
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,686
You boys are fucking crazy men.

244
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,730
- Yeah, but you feel it, though, right?
- Yeah.

245
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,326
You feel it.

246
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,767
Yeah, you can feel the power.

247
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,284
Now, squeeze it.

248
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,961
Powerful.

249
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,408
- Fucking useless.
- Piss off, John.

250
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,125
Michael, why does a pen pusher who sits
on his arse all day wanna fire a gun?

251
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,528
Hmm? Eh?

252
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,090
Cock it again.

253
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,090
- Cock it again.
- Cock it again.

254
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,446
Round two.

255
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,325
Mmm.

256
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,481
Look at that fucking face, John boy.

257
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,084
Look at that face.

258
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,890
Now he feels it.

259
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,847
But you won't feel nothing

260
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,684
until you point that thing on a man.

261
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,644
So do it.

262
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,451
There you go, young boss.

263
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,724
There you go. Now you feel it.

264
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,041
Now you feel what we feel.

265
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,526
This is what it's like.

266
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,047
Michael, that's a Webley.

267
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,165
Jumps on the hammer.

268
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,603
How does it feel, Michael, huh?

269
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,241
Better than having a pen
in your hand, isn't it?

270
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,165
More like having your cock in your hand.
Yeah.

271
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,046
Yeah, it is.

272
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,529
One squeeze.

273
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,321
I'm gone.

274
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,204
I'm fucking meat.

275
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,605
Michael, you fucking watch
that Webley don't jump. You know that?

276
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,281
When you pull that fucking trigger,

277
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,969
and the body of the man you shot
wraps itself around your ankles,

278
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,644
they pile up.

279
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,807
It gets to the point
where you can't walk in a room

280
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,447
without bringing
a load of them with you.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,445
What's going on?

282
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,681
What's going on?

283
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,409
Polly, we're just
educating the boss here

284
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,404
one our side of the business.

285
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,201
Michael, get in the house.

286
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,370
I'm not a fucking kid any more.

287
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,200
You've come to tell me it's cancelled.

288
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,725
No, why would it be?

289
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,881
I read the papers.

290
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,406
- This is business.
- It won't work.

291
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,488
I told your brother,
this whole fucking plan won't work.

292
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,801
If Tommy wants to keep this secret...
Tell him.

293
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,089
There was a woman in a fur coat
walking through here in broad daylight

294
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,289
like the Queen of fucking Sheba
asking about armoured cars.

295
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,046
During a period of grieving,
some things were allowed to slip.

296
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,450
We know the woman.
We're dealing with it.

297
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,448
Now, take a look at this list.

298
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,329
These are all the men
who work the night shift

299
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,125
who are members
of the South Birmingham Communist Party.

300
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,761
You've got six weeks. Sack them all.

301
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,010
Are you fucking mad?

302
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,041
He is.

303
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,001
Yeah.

304
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,163
Every factory in the city
will come out on strike.

305
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,528
So? You find reasons.

306
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,485
You set them up.

307
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,006
You sack them.

308
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,241
Look at the list again.

309
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,406
Are there any communists on your shift
who aren't on the list?

310
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,566
No.

311
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,682
Please don't fucking lie to us.

312
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,967
- Who's missing?
- I don't know.

313
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,686
Emmanuel Hunter.

314
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,961
Hmm?

315
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,051
Convener, deputy treasurer,
Sparkhill Communist Party.

316
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,563
Lathe operator to you.

317
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,771
I didn't know he was a communist.

318
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,006
We left that name
off the list on purpose.

319
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,362
See if you could be trusted.

320
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,445
You can't be trusted.

321
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,648
Look, I'm just a working man.

322
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,290
We're gonna be watching you.

323
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,291
- Watching your fucking house.
- I've got kids.

324
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,286
Ethan and John.

325
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,290
Just get them sacked

326
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,571
as they appear on the list, two a week.

327
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,451
The last one before
the clocks go forward.

328
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,090
Is that a yes or a no?

329
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,565
- Yes.
- Thank you.

330
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,686
Good.

331
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,561
Good.

332
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,687
- Do you think he'll return?
- Tommy?

333
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,771
He'll always come back.

334
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,881
You speak differently when you talk...

335
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,724
I prefer to talk about other things.

336
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
Let me see.

337
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,170
What books do you like?

338
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,290
Riding, flower arranging, embroidery?

339
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,362
You'd be surprised of the things I know.

340
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,081
You'd also be surprised
of the things I don't know.

341
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,282
What could you possibly not know?

342
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,885
I wasn't educated.

343
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,241
- At all.
- What is there to learn, after all?

344
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,081
Goodness.

345
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,607
I'm sorry. You must need a rest.

346
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,201
Do you tell your friends
you're painting a gangster?

347
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,130
Is that the fun in all of this?

348
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,610
In truth, I don't have any friends.

349
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,089
I knew everyone through my wife.

350
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,926
When she died...

351
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,841
Well...

352
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
Look, Polly,

353
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,321
my motivation for doing this is twofold.

354
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,047
Firstly, you have a face
full of contradictions,

355
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,806
and it's a challenge
to capture them in one expression.

356
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,009
That's the sales pitch.

357
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,729
The second motivation is that
I am planning to seduce you eventually

358
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,208
and, please God, sleep with you.

359
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,244
How would that please God?

360
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,291
Please me.

361
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,081
And stop.

362
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,930
And he didn't say what he wants.

363
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,809
When he was drunk, he said absolution.

364
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,805
Other than that, nothing.

365
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,362
Thank you for your time, Madame Boswell.

366
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,929
I heard someone shot your wife.

367
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,606
If you're looking for soldiers,
our men are all up at Appleby.

368
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,564
I have no need for soldiers.

369
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,085
It's not why I came here.

370
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,481
What do you think?

371
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,040
You're selling?

372
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,281
Giving.

373
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,650
- Why?
- Would you take it?

374
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,766
I'd take it.

375
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,686
Would you wear it?

376
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,762
- Why would I not?
- That's my question.

377
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,807
My wife was wearing it
the night she was shot,

378
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,330
and I lie awake at night
at 4:00 in the fucking morning,

379
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,801
and I blame myself for her death.

380
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,404
I pushed some people too far.

381
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,766
You want me to tell you
this jewel is cursed,

382
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,607
and then her death won't be
all your fault.

383
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,522
If I believed in the priests,

384
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,521
I would confess and ask for forgiveness,

385
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,764
but all I have is you, Madame Boswell.

386
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,770
I have a son.

387
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,684
I have a business.

388
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,810
I need to get some sleep.

389
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,965
It is cursed.

390
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,448
I feel its curse
burning through my heart.

391
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,283
Bless you, Tommy Shelby.

392
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,408
You'll have good fortune from now on.

393
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,926
- The business is done?
- It's done.

394
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,725
You're not going to give me
one fucking clue what that was about?

395
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,842
All religion is a foolish answer
to a foolish question.

396
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,440
What does that mean?

397
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,931
Go and get Charlie from the camp.

398
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,002
He'll have learned enough
bad habits by now.

399
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,923
You can drop us to the train station.

400
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,402
And johnny boy, if I were you,

401
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,883
I'd come back here tonight later on.

402
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,681
It's gonna be
one hell of a big fucking party.

403
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,364
The day and date on your ticket.

404
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,927
If you can't read, find someone who can.

405
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,446
Tickets for sailings other than today's
will be destroyed.

406
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,289
He has people all over the docks.

407
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,408
If it's going to happen,
it will happen now.

408
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,005
We'll be all right.

409
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,289
Why don't these Irish
fill in their papers in advance?

410
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,331
Think about Mott Street, the café,
the smell of the coffee.

411
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,083
Police! Help! Police!

412
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,209
Officer, there are some men,
they mean us harm.

413
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,682
We are in danger here.
Can you escort us to the dock?

414
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,687
Please.

415
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,001
Come with me.

416
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,211
Excuse me, brother. You got a light?

417
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,207
Thank you, Officer.

418
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,283
- That'll be all.
- John Shelby.

419
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,771
Is that the lad I used to teach?
John Shelby, I smacked your arse.

420
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,486
Let him go.

421
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,331
- Please. Please, let her go.
- Arthur?

422
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,890
How many times I looked the other way
because of your sweet smile.

423
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,931
I said, let him go. He's coming with us.

424
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,651
Not until I know my wife is safe.

425
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,604
She's safe. We're not going to harm her.

426
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,401
Let's just get a move on.

427
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,326
Look, we're disobeying Tommy's orders
just by talking to you.

428
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,807
Don't push it, please.

429
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,528
- Come with us. Let him go.
- Let him go, too.

430
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,285
Say it's done.

431
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,123
Say he's in the harbour.
He can do you no harm from New York.

432
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,330
I can't do that, Mrs Changretta.
I can't do that. Sorry.

433
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,368
OK, OK. Audrey, listen.

434
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,010
- No!
- Listen to me!

435
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,691
Go to the café in Mott Street.
Bonito will take care of you.

436
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,327
Let him go, too. He's an old man.

437
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,529
I gave you sweets and cakes.

438
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,170
Mrs Changretta, there are rules.

439
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,684
Your husband knows the rules.

440
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,291
- Come on, old man.
- No.

441
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,720
Sorry.

442
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,528
We're disobeying orders here.

443
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,329
Let him fucking go!

444
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,485
You have 10 seconds,
or Tommy's orders stand.

445
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,608
They stand. One!

446
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,848
- Two!
- Please!

447
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,011
Three.

448
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,002
- I love you forever.
- Four.

449
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,604
- No, no, no!
- America. A new life.

450
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,241
No, no, no!

451
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,731
A new love.

452
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,329
Do you know what time it is, old man?

453
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,924
I'll tell you.

454
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,284
It's after seven in the evening,

455
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,767
and I'm going to keep you alive
until it gets light.

456
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,045
I'll not deliver the final cut

457
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,850
until we can both hear
the blackbirds singing outside.

458
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,647
It's a beautiful sound,

459
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,322
which my wife will never hear again.

460
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,448
Now, I'm gonna have to choose carefully

461
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,242
which part of you I cut away first.

462
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,851
Open your eyes.

463
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,562
Open your eyes,
or I will cut away your fucking eyelids!

464
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,089
Now look at me.

465
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,884
Look at me.

466
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,330
This is the end.

467
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,885
This is the end.

468
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,167
It was your tongue that gave the order.

469
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,041
I'll take your tongue first.

470
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,524
Then I'll take your ears.

471
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,287
Then I'll take your fingers.

472
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,483
Then your fucking toes.

473
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,283
See, I take your balls first,
you drain too fast like you fuckers do.

474
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,290
No, I think tongue first. Tongue first.

475
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,921
Tongue first.

476
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,411
If I take your tongue,
you won't be able to explain,

477
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,963
and I want you to explain.
I want you to fucking explain.

478
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,841
Come on, Tommy.

479
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,722
I forget who I am.

480
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,130
I forget who I am.

481
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,050
I'm a Blinder.
I'll take your fucking eyes first!

482
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,762
I heard the blackbird sing.

483
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,363
And we let his wife
board the immigrant ship to New York.

484
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,527
We didn't kill Mrs Changretta.

485
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,406
And tonight...

486
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,527
We're not those kind of men.

487
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,529
You get rid of the body, John.

488
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,246
Get rid of those for good.

489
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,650
All gone.

490
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,401
Oh!

491
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,521
Did you do what was on your list, Ada?

492
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,602
You and your fucking lists.

493
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,691
Did you?

494
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,686
I spoke to an old friend of Freddie's.

495
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,445
He's a Communist Party candidate
for Basall Heath.

496
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,360
I asked him about the Birmingham branch
of the National Vigilance Committee.

497
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,851
He said he'd heard the Soviet Embassy
was getting information from the inside.

498
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,767
And? Has he got a name?

499
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,566
Yes.

500
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,888
But just promise me
no one will get killed.

501
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,568
Ada, it'll be me or John or Arthur
who gets killed

502
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,210
if you don't give me the fucking name.

503
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,250
There's someone ahead of us,
and I need to know why.

504
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,930
James Monkland.

505
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,009
He's a Lloyds underwriter.
He's got an office on Curzon Street.

506
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,327
Tommy, for fuck's sake,
who is it that's ahead of you?

507
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,881
I knew I could count on you, Ada.

508
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,243
No, you can't,
and I just asked you a fucking question.

509
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,209
And I notice
you started wearing lipstick again.

510
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,045
So what?

511
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,126
I got bored.

512
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,250
You can change what you do,
but you can't change what you want.

513
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,326
And what is it that I want?

514
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,443
There's gonna be a vacancy coming up
at Shelby Company Limited.

515
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,444
Boston office.

516
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,245
Boston, America?

517
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,089
Lipstick. Clothes from Paris.

518
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,249
No revolvers. All legal.

519
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,409
Just turn a few heads.
Do the transit deals.

520
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,884
James Monkland, right?

521
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,368
Good night, Ada.

522
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,451
- James Monkland?
- Yours, sir.

523
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,160
Who the hell are you?

524
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,001
What do you want with me?

525
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,242
You've been passing information
about a robbery

526
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,322
at the Lanchester factory in Sparkbrook.

527
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,686
Are you Tommy Shelby?

528
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,730
I need to know the name of the person
in the organisation

529
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,201
that was giving you information.

530
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,201
What organisation?

531
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,922
The Economic League,
the Vigilance Committee,

532
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,764
the Odd Fellows, Section D.

533
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,204
They have many fucking names.

534
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,520
Shit, shit, shit.

535
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,402
Give me the name of the informant.

536
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,570
Mr Shelby,

537
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,202
they are very, very dangerous people.

538
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,248
Oh. Hmm.

539
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,527
Well, fortunately, so are we.

540
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,408
You have to choose
who you're more afraid of.

541
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,371
The Peaky Blinders at exactly 11:43,

542
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,480
or Section D at some point
in the future.

543
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,885
If you make the wrong choice,
you won't see 11:44.

544
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,004
Do they always have to do
the stock taking at night, Arthur?

545
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,368
Only 'cause, you know,
it slows down production.

546
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,566
Thank you.

547
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,921
Thank you.

548
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,369
Night work will have to end.

549
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,124
It will. It will.

550
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,321
You'll have things to do at night.

551
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
Yeah.

552
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,684
I know.

553
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,842
We've spoken about it.

554
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,730
I was gonna wait until you had
a strong cup of tea in your hand.

555
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,122
- Come on, then.
- But I'm gonna have a baby, Arthur.

556
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,561
Pregnant?

557
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,045
Yeah.

558
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,726
You said you spent the night
taking stock. Well, so did I.

559
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,605
This working at night will have to stop.

560
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,888
- You'll have a baby.
- Yes.

561
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,324
Oh, it's great news.

562
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,531
Right, then.

563
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,809
Let's have a cup of tea. One moment.

564
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,921
Come on. Let's have that tea.

565
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,325
Arthur, for fuck's sake, what is it?

566
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,609
No. We wait for Tommy.

567
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,004
I've got a stolen statue back there

568
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,287
with its dick hanging out
waiting to be melted down.

569
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,730
Tell us. Tell Tommy later.

570
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,451
Yeah, look, he's not here.
He's not here. I'm going.

571
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,247
- Hold your horses.
- There he is.

572
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,685
- Bye, Curly.
- There he is.

573
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,000
All right, what is it?

574
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,844
Arthur's fucking giving us
all this shit.

575
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,967
Come on. Come on.

576
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,326
Right.

577
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,447
Arthur, you got wire
on the fucking cork. Give it here.

578
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,444
Bastard. Right. Gentlemen!

579
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,524
Linda is up the swanny.
I'm gonna be a fucking dad.

580
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,327
Fuck off.

581
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,207
Yes, Curly. Yeah.

582
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,090
Arthur, I knew you had it in you.

583
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,125
I knew he had it in him.

584
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,406
September she reckons.

585
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,685
Her tits feel different already.

586
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,967
Yeah, that's not the only thing
that's gonna be different, brother.

587
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,924
You're fucked now, man.

588
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,884
Fucked. Absolutely fucked.

589
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,202
Oh, nothing's gonna change, John.

590
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,801
Goodbye, Arthur.

591
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,043
- I have a meeting I have to go to.
- Yeah.

592
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,410
Yeah, of course you do.

593
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,526
Yeah, you...

594
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,760
You go to, mate.

595
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,604
Congratulations.

596
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,368
- I'm gonna be a dad.
- Proud of you.

597
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,083
Your Highness, Mr Thomas Shelby.

598
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,649
Welcome, Mr Shelby.

599
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,044
I believe you've met everyone
apart from my wife,

600
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,048
Grand Duchess Izabella Petrovna.

601
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,410
Please, take a seat.

602
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,088
Before we begin, Mr Shelby,

603
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,364
we must offer you our sincere
condolences on your recent loss,

604
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,125
which some of us witnessed.

605
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,806
- Did you drive, Mr Shelby?
- Yes.

606
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,130
- They say you're an expert on cars.
- Yes, I am.

607
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,488
I am curious.
What was your father's profession?

608
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,763
Well, he told fortunes,
and he stole horses.

609
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,083
Often, he would tell a man
that his horse would be stolen,

610
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,686
and they would marvel at his powers
when it was.

611
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,566
Before we eat, should we say grace?

612
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,605
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

613
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,849
- Amen.
- I'm not here to eat.

614
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,171
I'm here to do business.

615
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,251
What I have to say can be said
before the main course.

616
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,004
Then I will leave you all
to your evening.

617
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,884
Grand Duchess, I must apologise
for the bad manners of my compatriot.

618
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,203
This is a report on the mission's
progress so far.

619
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,681
I've made only one copy for security.

620
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,446
Who should I give it to?

621
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,126
My husband
is in charge of this operation.

622
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,485
But since there will no doubt
be vodka later,

623
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,086
perhaps you should give it to me
for safe-keeping.

624
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,011
Speak, Mr Shelby, while we eat.

625
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,802
Five factory foremen on our payroll
have begun a campaign of victimisation

626
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,531
against communist workers
in five factories across Birmingham.

627
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,050
Anger amongst the workers will grow,
but we will control it.

628
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,043
On the night of June 21st,

629
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,811
a general strike will be called
across the city.

630
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,762
Protests will develop into riots,

631
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,322
and all police that are not
already under our control will be busy.

632
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,050
The city will be paralysed.

633
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,369
So how will you move the train?

634
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,363
We have two locomotive drivers

635
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,410
who've been allocated to drive
the midnight goods train to London.

636
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,767
The armoured vehicles will be waiting
on flatbeds.

637
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,729
- And ammunition?
- The ammunition...

638
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,883
I have to say
that this soup is exceptional.

639
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,930
Absolutely delicious.

640
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,680
Ammunition, incendiaries will already
have been packed up and crated

641
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,285
for transport to Istanbul.

642
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,489
- And how long to London?
- The train won't reach London.

643
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,641
All the goods will be unloaded
at a coal yard at St Albans

644
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,884
and put onto Shelby Company trucks.

645
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,849
From there, they will go directly
to the Poplar Docks.

646
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,367
You Highness, if you're having
difficulty understanding his accent,

647
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,808
then I can go through the plan with you
at a later date.

648
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,843
If there is no ship waiting for my men,

649
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,686
all goods will be dumped into the sea
before first light.

650
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,127
What happens when they discover
the armoured cars are missing?

651
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,364
During the rioting, the
Lanchester factory will be firebombed.

652
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,966
A scrap metal dealer of my acquaintance
will declare

653
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,202
that all the armoured vehicles
are in the wreckage

654
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,044
and should be written off as salvage.

655
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,327
No one will know
that they are in your possession.

656
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,048
We formulated this plan
when we met at Birmingham.

657
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,647
I'm certain that
nothing has been overlooked.

658
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,886
This is the amount of extra expense
I believe I will incur

659
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,724
for trucks and fuels.

660
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,443
I trust you will respond in kind.

661
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,964
But of course, Mr Shelby.

662
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,971
Before I go,

663
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,609
I would like it known
that I'm unable to swallow food

664
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,049
in the same room as this priest.

665
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,765
Enjoy your evening.

666
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,043
Tatiana, see Mr Shelby to his car.

667
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,531
Yes.

668
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,646
Walk with me.

669
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,441
The priest is passing information
about the robbery

670
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,204
to a Lloyds underwriter called Monkland.

671
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,887
He, in turn, is passing information
to the Soviet Embassy.

672
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,921
You want him dead?
I'll kill him, no charge.

673
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,761
Why would the priest
pass information to our enemies?

674
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,483
I'm being paid to act and to observe,
like a soldier.

675
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,531
The complexities are your business.

676
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,326
Go and speak to Izabella.
I trust her to decide.

677
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,367
You were able to contain your business
dealings even after what happened.

678
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,651
Perhaps you didn't love her.

679
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,411
She's here by my side,

680
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,924
and she says,
"Don't trust these people."

681
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,241
Now give me permission
to kill the priest.

682
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,500
