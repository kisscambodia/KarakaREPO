1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,367
<i>"A factory break-in,"
that's what you said.</i>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,881
We should never have got into this, Tom.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,200
On the night of June 21st,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,726
a general strike will be called
across the city.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,131
How do we know this foolish man

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,929
will hand over the diamonds
when we're done?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,082
We don't. But that's another business.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,924
When this business is done,
it will all be over.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,161
And afterwards,

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,686
you and Arthur can begin your new life.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,728
So there are three cellars
underneath the house.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,131
There's a tunnel here that runs

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,044
from the house, underneath the river,
to an underground strong room.

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,522
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room, direct.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,485
I need to speak
to you about the Priest.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,806
<i>I will shoot him myself, Tommy.</i>

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,681
I swear to God,
if my son pulls the trigger,

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,803
I will bring this whole organisation
down around your ears.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,405
Welcome to the opening
of the Grace Shelby Institute

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,922
for non-insured children of the poor.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,286
I would very much like you to
join me in thanking the man

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,043
that made the founding of this
establishment actually possible.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,404
Ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,806
Mr Thomas Shelby.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,641
Speech!

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,442
Come on, speech!

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,963
Aw!

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,965
Say it, Tom. Say it to 'em!

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,283
Erm, I didn't come here today to
make a speech, but I will say this.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,649
These children are now safe.

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,886
In our care, they will be safe.

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,645
Because we are from the same
cold streets as they are.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,649
And in our care, they won't be
shipped away to the colonies,

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,689
or separated from kin,

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,881
or made to work for men
in their various ways.

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,365
They will grow up here, at home...

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,806
loved...

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,331
in Birmingham.

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,924
Because this is our city.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,129
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,201
Hail!

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,206
Now let us sing <i>Immortal, Invisible.</i>

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,329
You hear that, Grace?

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,607
The absence of my invitation
for this event

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,206
was obviously an oversight
on your part, Mr Shelby.

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,687
Look, I have the keys.
I have allocated myself an office.

48
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
Just there,
two doors in from the street,

49
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,209
it's the one that already has the stove
and the crucifixion on the window.

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,725
Mr Shelby?

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,084
It is the one that has the crucifixion
on the window in orange and red,

52
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,730
that will be my office.

53
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,842
And I will take them to
Saint Aloysius for confession.

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,926
You do understand these keys are
part of our broader arrangement?

55
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,722
In the next 24 hours, you will do
exactly as you have been instructed.

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,601
You will not deviate, you'll not fail.

57
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,329
Come on, little fellas.

58
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,281
Ow!

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,041
The, uh...

60
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,888
The Lord Mayor would like you to
come and eat cake and drink some tea.

61
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,131
Tommy says, "Mingle and smile."

62
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,771
It must be the trains.

63
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,046
No Ruben?

64
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,771
Do you know any other guests
from London who have not turned up?

65
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,042
Some, I think. Yes.

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,363
Pol, I'm paid by the company now,
so I have to talk to other people.

67
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,809
So you have moved from horses to
automobiles in just four years?

68
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,207
When you ship to New York
you pay a higher dock duty.

69
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,402
You should consider coming with us
through Boston.

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,365
I just spoke to johnny Dogs.
He said the tunnel's hit heavy clay.

71
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,851
- It's slowing him down.
- How long?

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,490
Two days before they hit the wall.

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,528
Tell him to dig a sinkhole
to drain the clay.

74
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,802
He's asked if you could go down
and have a look yourself, Tom.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,604
I told him, wild horses
wouldn't get you down.

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,045
- Hmm.
- Yes.

77
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,960
Mr Shelby, I'd just like to say that
I wish I had met your dear wife

78
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,485
before she was taken from us.

79
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,485
And I would like to allocate
an hour a day of each of my lady's time

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,244
to make winter clothes
for the little ones.

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,802
Speak to my secretary, Ms Stark,
in the grey hat. She knows my diary.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,445
Fuck me, Tom.
I don't know how you do it.

83
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,646
Incoming.

84
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,881
- Mr Shelby?
- Yes?

85
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,361
Aw. Your little boy
looks so much like you.

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,522
He does, yes.
He's a little rascal, isn't he?

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,366
Mr Shelby, would it be too inconvenient
to steal you for a moment?

88
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,363
No, no. No inconvenience at all.

89
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,329
Tommy, I am sorry. He wants you.

90
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,687
- Aw, come here, Charlie.
- There's Daddy.

91
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,087
Oh, little boy.

92
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,370
So lovely to see a man
willing to hold his child in public.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,044
From the members of

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,044
- the Moseley War Widow's Institute.
- Ooh, watch this!

95
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,170
Made by Mr Winslow himself
of Winslow Castings.

96
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,287
Look at that!

97
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,011
From a photograph of your
horse that ran at the derby.

98
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,241
Oh, that is very kind.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,924
- Thank you very much.
- Grace's Secret.

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,690
Charlie.

101
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,728
Would you mind holding it for us

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,689
so that we can have a photograph
for the gazette?

103
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,765
Hey, hey, hey.

104
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,763
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

105
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,080
Thank you very much.

106
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,525
Thank you, Mr Shelby.

107
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,604
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,569
Thank you for your time, ladies.

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,849
Thank you. Thank you for your time.
Thank you. Thank you.

110
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,410
Where's Charles, Ada?

111
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,891
I gave him to you.

112
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,725
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

113
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,086
Boys.

114
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,120
- Have you seen Charlie?
- Eh?

115
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,241
- I haven't seen him.
- I don't know.

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,321
He is playing, ain't he?

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,960
Pol, where's Charles?

118
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,883
Lizzie, where is Charlie?

119
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,769
- I don't know.
- Where is he?

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,285
Back Door. Kitchen.

121
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,964
Get to Blake Street, where the cars are.

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,805
Tommy! Someone said they saw a nurse
take him through the back door.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,881
- Fuck.
- What nurse?

124
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,961
I don't know. Go.

125
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,246
- Arthur.
- What?

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,362
Somebody said they saw a woman
and a kid getting into a car.

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,566
Ah, fuck!

128
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,331
Charlie!

129
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,482
Charlie!

130
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,800
Charlie!

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,962
John.

132
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,644
- Where is he?
- John.

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,290
- Arthur.
- Go find Moss.

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,001
- Arthur, where is he? Where is he?
- Junctions, block them all off.

135
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,605
- Tell me.
- Someone took him.

136
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,806
All right.

137
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,962
Hey, listen to me!
They put him in a car.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,122
They put him in a car and drove south.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,250
We've got roadblocks and spotters.

140
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,011
I'll set up shop
and put every man we have

141
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,651
- on the junctions from here to Maypole.
- Yeah. Yeah. Right. You do that.

142
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,210
- But you have got to go to the office.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,089
You've got to sit by the phone.

144
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,730
- Whoever took him is going to call.
- Right. Of course.

145
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,847
Polly!

146
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,965
Let's go, Pol.

147
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,085
Stay by that phone.
Me and John will cover the roads.

148
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,209
I need Michael
at the Maypole junction.

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,402
I need Moss to block
all the roads south.

150
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,565
Give me Moss. Gone where?

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,442
- Tommy...
- It's them.

152
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,130
- Who?
- It's fucking them.

153
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,725
Look, it might just be
some random woman.

154
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,201
- Because sometimes women go mad...
- No, it is them.

155
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,881
Did you break the phone?

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,082
He broke the phone.

157
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
It's all right,
we have got another phone.

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,084
- Tommy?
- Ada?

159
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,682
There's someone outside, a priest.

160
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,524
Stay here, Pol, stay here.
Don't do anything.

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,846
We have your son.
Get in the car.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,206
First.

163
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,011
Is he safe?

164
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,128
Of course he's safe.

165
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,208
All children are dear to me.

166
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,681
You have all the cards.

167
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,764
Tell me what you want me to do
and I will certainly do it.

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,241
You ever drive one of these beasts?

169
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,243
I am asking you to conduct business.

170
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,209
Of course, I borrowed it.

171
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,291
Lent it by a Lord
for the duration of this business.

172
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,764
I will certainly do what you
need me to do with no complaint.

173
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,606
We were forced into
doing this awful thing.

174
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,130
We did warn you that your son would be
in danger if you deviated from the plan.

175
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,406
It was you who made a mistake.

176
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,641
- You understand?
- Yes.

177
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,922
What mistake did you make?
Do you even know?

178
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,481
Tell me what you want me to do.

179
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,088
- You made a deal with our enemies.
- I will do what needs to be done.

180
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,848
You went behind our backs to stop
the Soviets from blowing up the train.

181
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,006
But it's all right. It's all right.

182
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,082
We've rectified your mistake.

183
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,328
You ask me, "What do I need to do?"

184
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,362
Well, here is what you need to do,
you fucking mongrel, you...

185
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,811
Since the Bolsheviks will not
be blowing up the train,

186
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,725
you will blow up the train yourself.

187
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,962
It has always been about the explosion

188
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,166
from the beginning.
The bang. The outrage.

189
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,685
Understand?

190
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,167
Those are notes and fragments
for you to scatter in the wreckage,

191
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,481
implicating named officials
from the Soviet Embassy.

192
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,129
I will scatter them. It will be done.

193
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
Good.

194
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,003
Our friends at <i>The Times</i> and
the <i>Daily Mail</i> will do the rest.

195
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,128
And once the British government

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,568
cuts diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union,

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,047
that will be our mission accomplished.

198
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,726
You would have been
part of a fine adventure.

199
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,729
To help with the outrage,
we need people to die in the explosion.

200
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,881
How many?

201
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,889
Let's say... six.

202
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,327
Rail workers, perhaps,
men from the factory.

203
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,604
And I want my son returned to me
within an hour of the explosion.

204
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,490
Oh, it's conditions now, is it?

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,082
We need to fix the
handover in advance.

206
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,642
I haven't finished
with you yet, Mr Shelby.

207
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,401
We also hear
that you are digging a tunnel.

208
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,564
Mining for precious stones
under Wilderness House.

209
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,487
I'm told they have a Fabergé
in the strong room.

210
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,963
The Lilies of the Valley Egg
made in 1898.

211
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,601
One of the Odd Fellows has a wife
who's obsessed with Fabergé.

212
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,205
He wants to give her the egg
for her birthday.

213
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,441
Then he will have it.

214
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,161
And the Economic League will take
all of the jewels that you steal,

215
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,363
to cover our considerable expenses.

216
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,921
The fight against Communism
is not cheap you know.

217
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,604
- So if you want to see your...
- I will give you all the jewels.

218
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,048
A bang first.

219
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,160
Then bring everything that you
have stolen to your office at dawn.

220
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,208
No. No, I'm, uh...

221
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,081
I'll not be able to get the
jewels to you by dawn.

222
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,286
The tunnel has hit clay.

223
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,405
If the St. Andrew's clock strikes
5:00 a.m. on the night of the robbery

224
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,966
and we don't have everything
that we asked for,

225
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,730
the bell will be tolling for your boy.

226
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,090
Now get out of my fucking car.

227
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,724
- Where's Linda?
- With Esme.

228
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,165
Esme's water broke.

229
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,403
I was just with her. Running around,
fucking broke her water.

230
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,289
- Where is Finn?
- Out with the young ones,

231
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,404
looking for the Riley.
We couldn't reach him.

232
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,005
I need to know who spoke.

233
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,889
Our enemies know everything. Everything.

234
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,763
I need to know who spoke about business
outside of the family.

235
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,491
I need to know who spoke
and who they spoke to, now.

236
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,608
- Tommy, listen, uh...
- Your wife, Arthur?

237
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,722
I am going to tell myself that
you are not thinking straight.

238
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,484
Your mind is not clear.

239
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,050
Or Esme getting cash
for cocaine, eh, John?

240
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,167
Fuck!

241
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,490
All of a sudden,
back in the family, Ada.

242
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,040
Eh? That is a surprise.
Out of the blue.

243
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,481
On whose orders?

244
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,722
Tommy, this is
not helping find him.

245
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,801
And you and your painter.

246
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,485
You said he knows you.

247
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,400
Things developed. You talked.

248
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,565
If anyone has talked about
the tunnel to anyone else,

249
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,802
I need to know,
and I need to know this second.

250
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,167
- What about your clay kickers?
- Hmm.

251
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,526
Drunk in a pub.

252
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,404
I'd trust those men with my life.

253
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,051
- More than you trust us?
- Yes.

254
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,690
As of an hour ago, yes.

255
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,409
Why is Michael not in
this fucking line-up, anyway?

256
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,050
- You leave Michael out of this.
- Oh, yes?

257
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,770
- No, he should be here.
- I fucking don't even know him.

258
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,888
And I have only fucking known him
for fucking three years.

259
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,041
No, he is not going
to be your whipping boy.

260
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,246
I don't even fucking know the boy.

261
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,006
I never told Michael
about the Lilies of the Valley.

262
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,720
The only people I told about
the Fabergé eggs are in this room.

263
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,281
Tommy, I want you to know
that I came back for love...

264
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,001
and common sense.

265
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,722
And Esme's got no need for extra cash.

266
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,289
And you bring my wife into this,

267
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,006
means we speak
when this business is done.

268
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,046
John, Arthur,

269
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,609
I need 50 sticks of BSA dynamite
and 300 yards of cable

270
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,651
and six detonators by midday tomorrow.

271
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,484
And this is evidence.
I need you to scatter it.

272
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,842
We're blowing up a train,
and people are going to die.

273
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,489
Ruben and I talked about many things.

274
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,360
But not that. Not ever.

275
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,251
Tommy, I'm sorry I'm late.

276
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,402
We looked everywhere,
all the way up to Hay Mills.

277
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,481
We saw nothing.

278
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,847
Put four cans of petrol in the boot
of my car and bring it round.

279
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,044
Put cigarettes and a lamp in the box.

280
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,526
And fetch Michael. I need him.

281
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,609
Ada told me he gave you red wine.

282
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,161
I imagine you can't remember
half of what you talked about.

283
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,765
He was never interested in business.

284
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,761
He came to you at my wedding.

285
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,207
He pursued you. Sought you out.

286
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,162
Why would an educated man of his
standing do something like that?

287
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,051
- You mean, to a woman like me?
- Yes.

288
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,521
I've done the odds on all of you.
Even's it's him.

289
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,768
There is another possibility,
but even's it's him.

290
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,405
Bloody hell.

291
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,684
I asked that you come alone and unarmed.

292
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,286
Yeah, well, alone I ain't
never gonna do, am I?

293
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,289
And as for the cane,
don't worry about it.

294
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,845
That is just my sciatica.

295
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,163
It always plays up around the
winter and the summer solstice.

296
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,283
What have you got for me, Alfie?

297
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,566
What did you
bring me out here for?

298
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,447
This is on the way
to somewhere I need to be in a hurry.

299
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,211
- Mmm.
- What have you got for me?

300
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,568
Well, seeing as you were prepared
to pay such an exorbitant amount

301
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,645
for this information, I decided
to give you value for money.

302
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,925
So here are the names
of all the men in England

303
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,880
whom I would approach, right,
if I had a Fabergé egg for sale.

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,570
Here you go.

305
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,570
And then, here's all
the men on that list,

306
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,648
you know, who would buy
the old Fabergé egg,

307
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,007
even if they knew that
that item was stolen.

308
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,121
Here.

309
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,849
Then comes your curious
fucking gyppo question.

310
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,410
I won't ask but, erm...

311
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,922
Here is a list of the men
who would buy a Fabergé

312
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,321
because of their wife's obsession.

313
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,201
Ah, yes. Thank you, Mr Shelby.
It's lovely doing business with you.

314
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,890
You left a name off the list, Alfie.

315
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,291
- Did I?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,921
I've already spoken to my people
in the jewellery quarter.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,128
Experienced dealers.

318
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,090
They tell me there are only
three men in Britain

319
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,049
whose wives are obsessed with Fabergé.

320
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,849
Makes them good customers.

321
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,809
You missed the richest one off the list.

322
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,803
Yeah, well, if you knew already

323
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,009
how come you dragged me all the way
out into the fucking oggin, mate?

324
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,923
Two reasons. Reason one.

325
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,202
By withholding a name
that you most certainly know,

326
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,887
you've proven to me that you have
done a deal with the Odd Fellows.

327
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,725
It was you who told them
about the tunnel.

328
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,044
You who told them about the
fucking deal with the Soviets.

329
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,121
Reason two.

330
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,406
The name of the man that you're
withholding must be my enemy

331
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,483
otherwise,
you wouldn't be protecting him.

332
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,411
He is now a man I can use.

333
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,050
Listen, sweetie, you can't take a man...

334
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,885
You gave information
in exchange for a share.

335
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,122
Tommy... Tommy there were
things in that treasury, right,

336
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,884
that God himself, He spoke to me,

337
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,247
and He said, "Alfie, you are
meant to have these things."

338
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,481
You crossed the line, Alfie.

339
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,169
- You fucking what?
- You crossed the line.

340
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,130
- "The line"?
- They are using my boy!

341
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,646
Did you fucking know?

342
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,563
Yeah, I knew, you know.

343
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,440
But damned as I am, it made
no fucking difference to me, mate.

344
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,288
Fucking hell, Tommy!

345
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,484
Oh! Crying out loud.

346
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,644
What the fuck is going on?

347
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,724
What is the matter with you, Tommy, eh?

348
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,328
Eh? You've gone fucking angry,
ain't you?

349
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,528
- Yeah, I got fucking angry...
- It's in your fucking head, man.

350
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,967
- Come on, man!
- This bastard deserves it!

351
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,246
He's nuts!

352
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,163
It's in your fucking head, son.

353
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,049
I know this bastard deserves it.

354
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,165
I fucking know.

355
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,762
But if you kill him now,
the truce with the London outfits

356
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,251
will be blown to
fucking pieces, all right?

357
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,800
- Michael. Michael.
- Don't worry about that truce, kid,

358
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,962
right, because it fell apart.

359
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,891
You got nothing to worry about when it
comes to the ol' scary London boys.

360
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,644
Which fucking side are you on, Alfie?

361
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,081
I do not give a fuck right now, kid.
All right?

362
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,684
I do not want him to spare me
because of some fucking peace pact.

363
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,930
I want him to acknowledge that
his anger is un-fucking justified!

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,686
I want him to acknowledge
that he who fights by the sword,

365
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,762
he fucking dies by it, Tommy.

366
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,286
So what, they took
your boy did they, eh?

367
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,566
They have got your boy?

368
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,968
What fucking "line" am I
supposed to have crossed?

369
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,163
How many fathers, right,
how many sons, yeah,

370
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,962
have you cut, killed, murdered
fucking butchered, innocent and guilty?

371
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,008
You are going straight to
fucking hell, ain't ya?

372
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,686
Just like me!

373
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,924
You fucking stand there,
you, judging me,

374
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,050
stand there and talk to me about
crossing some fucking line.

375
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,207
If you pull that trigger, right,

376
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,363
you pull that trigger
for a fucking honourable reason.

377
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,206
Like an honourable man,
not like some fucking civilian

378
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,128
that does not understand
the wicked way of our world, mate.

379
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,161
Look, Tommy,

380
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,563
the killing of Alfie Solomons
is not going to help.

381
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,885
This will be very bad for business.

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,411
Michael,

383
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,523
go and call Inspector Moss.
Tell him it's Palmer.

384
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,563
Well said, Alfie.

385
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,691
Well said.

386
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,203
I did not know about your boy, though.

387
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,051
I know.

388
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,365
I saw.

389
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,686
Hello?

390
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,641
Good Lord.

391
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,884
Polly...

392
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,684
Why didn't you come?

393
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,681
I was going to get on the train
last night but then I...

394
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,045
I realised I simply I wasn't
ready to enter your world.

395
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,211
Good God. I'm shaking.

396
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,361
Good.

397
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,001
But now, I am ready.
I have been searching all night for you.

398
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,404
Polly, whatever you have been told,
it is not true.

399
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,891
The painting was wrong.

400
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,527
She was too sure of herself...

401
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,083
and I'm not.

402
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,249
Not any more.

403
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,570
I can paint another.

404
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,530
Oh, Polly.

405
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,845
Oh, Polly.

406
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,843
What the fuck am I doing?

407
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,049
I want a dull life.

408
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,602
I want you. I want you. I want you.

409
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,481
I want you to paint me in a dress
that I bought in a shop.

410
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,130
We have a life?

411
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,131
I think so.

412
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,805
Hello?

413
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,011
I demand to see my solicitor.

414
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,321
I have a right to have him here.

415
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,891
Gilbert Palmer.

416
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,883
I want to talk to you
about a missing kid.

417
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,883
We are Peaky Blinders.

418
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,570
Where is he?

419
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,331
Deep breath.

420
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,766
Where is he?

421
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,888
johnny! johnny!

422
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,530
What the fuck are you doing here, Tommy?

423
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,005
They've taken my boy, johnny.

424
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,605
Everything's fucking changed.

425
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,802
I have the hole dug before midnight
or he's gone.

426
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,041
Do you hear me?

427
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,728
Are you not going
after Charles yourself?

428
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,291
Tommy?

429
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,240
Well, I was at...

430
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,360
This morning, I was out
on the road with Tommy.

431
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,841
I killed a man.

432
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,089
Well, he needed cover.
I was all he had.

433
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,610
So what did he give you?

434
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,242
He said it was good for close range.

435
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,565
You're better with my Smith & Wesson.

436
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,009
No, no. This is mine now.
It feels part of my hand.

437
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,926
Where'd you hit him?

438
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,330
I hit him in the side of the head.

439
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,731
How was you when he went down?

440
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,450
Tommy said I did all right.

441
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,801
This is where we think Charles
is being held.

442
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,571
They're not expecting anybody,
so he should be alone.

443
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,281
There is two good men there.

444
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,170
You do what they say.

445
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,888
But I fire the bullet. All right?

446
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,605
Yes, you can be there.

447
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,050
But it's better if they do it.

448
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,521
See, these are experienced men, Michael.

449
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,325
When you're sure the kid is safe,
you call Finn.

450
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,680
All right.

451
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,920
Come on, boys.

452
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,646
Hello there.

453
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,362
There you go. How's that?

454
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,403
Like a spoon? A shiny spoon?

455
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,890
Do you want to hold the spoon there?

456
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,488
All out, boys! Wild cat strike!

457
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,602
This locomotive

458
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,290
couples in 15 minutes.

459
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,441
If we don't hear word by 10:00,

460
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,441
we blow it up.

461
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,564
There are men on board, Arthur.

462
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,924
Yeah. Six men on board, Charlie.

463
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,771
Driver, stoker

464
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,404
and four men
I hand-picked myself.

465
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,968
Me and John picked those men.

466
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,968
So it is me and John
who will pull the switch.

467
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,289
The rest of you men can go home.

468
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,204
Tommy. Tommy.

469
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,443
He has got the shakes,
help me with him.

470
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,088
Get him out. Get him out.

471
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,685
We are bringing him through.

472
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,569
We need to move. Now.

473
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,606
You wait here.

474
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,201
I'll do the killing.

475
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,491
That is a fucking order.

476
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,041
You move too fast, Thomas.

477
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,087
We need more timber.

478
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,969
Make it safe. I will go on.

479
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,923
Thomas, it is too fucking wet.
It's sludge.

480
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,002
Make it fucking safe,
and I'll go on!

481
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,521
Okay.

482
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,289
What do you think you are doing, boy?

483
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,686
Please don't.

484
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,047
Please don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

485
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,323
Please don't. Please.

486
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,050
You fucking rat!

487
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,805
What do you think you're doing?

488
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,687
You know who you're
fuckin' messing with?

489
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,401
We don't have much time.

490
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,724
I'll take your fuckin'
life from you.

491
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,441
Let's go!

492
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,684
You are a gypsy bastard.

493
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,890
Who wants to be in heaven, eh?

494
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,163
Who want to be in heaven when you
can be sending men to fucking hell.

495
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,890
Hey.

496
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,687
I will do it, Arthur. Eh?

497
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,926
I'll do it.

498
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,688
I will take him.

499
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,205
No, this bastard is mine.

500
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,606
Go call Finn.

501
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,684
I told Tommy I'd do it...

502
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,811
so I'll do it.

503
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,005
Arthur, wait!

504
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,281
Charlie is safe.

505
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,043
It's all right.

506
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,410
- Oh, God!
- Oh!

507
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,521
Let me speak to him.

508
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,051
Hello, Charlie?

509
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,246
Hello, Charlie.

510
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,726
Can you hear me?

511
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,446
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

512
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,080
Yeah, you go to bed.

513
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,286
Good boy.

514
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,685
Where the hell have you been?

515
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,971
I've been out in Maypole.

516
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,130
There has been some trouble.

517
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,324
I can't stay.

518
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,802
You can't stay?

519
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,291
Tommy needs my help.

520
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,805
It's family business.

521
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,724
- No, no. Please.
- I am sorry.

522
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,006
Please.

523
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,328
- Where is he?
- He is upstairs.

524
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,967
Mr Shelby,
this is <i>Monsieur</i> Silk.

525
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,200
He is here on behalf
of the Parisian buyers.

526
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,248
He needs to verify the value.

527
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,720
It was a pleasure doing business
with you these past few months.

528
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,207
You would never steal
from your family, would you?

529
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,243
The collection was mostly
my mother's, anyway.

530
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,044
It is more mine than theirs,
and they would never have sold it.

531
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,209
They would have wasted it
on a lost cause.

532
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,364
You needed a tunnel.

533
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,368
I need your signature
to make this sale legal.

534
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,605
Confirmed.

535
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,880
The original Duke Alexander
Petrovich's collection.

536
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,209
To raise a legal bill of sale
and get this across the border,

537
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,522
I will need an authorisation

538
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,844
signed by yourself in the family name
in my presence.

539
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,491
As we agreed.

540
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,769
Half for the tunnel,
half for the signature.

541
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,481
Where will you go?

542
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,126
Vienna.

543
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,325
There is a man waiting for me.

544
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,886
Poor man.

545
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,487
You?

546
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,961
Birmingham.

547
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,685
I'm going to buy a racehorse

548
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,084
and have it trained.

549
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,448
Also, £5,000 for the sex.

550
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,245
And five for helping you
through the grief of losing your wife.

551
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,851
You didn't even come close.

552
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,727
The papers are in order.

553
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,640
Now I just need your signature
for the provenance.

554
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,768
Of course. I have a pen.

555
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,562
At home, these jewels saw way worse.

556
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,445
That is why they are all cursed...

557
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,409
as are we, Mr Shelby.

558
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,649
If you are ever in Vienna, look me up.

559
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,366
Yes, yes.

560
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,566
Before I begin,

561
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,089
I want to let you know
I made a mistake.

562
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,246
I made a mistake,

563
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,323
and I want to apologise
to all of you.

564
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,926
Arthur,

565
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,325
you warned me against getting
involved in Russian business,

566
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,206
and you were right.

567
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,041
Mmm.

568
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,402
I doubted your wife,
for that, I am sorry.

569
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,605
Linda, I have added 3,000 here,
in the hope you will forgive me.

570
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,528
Apology accepted.

571
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,802
Esme, I doubted you as well.

572
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,449
Now John has got innocent lives
on his conscience.

573
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,124
- Ordinary working men...
- Yeah, all right.

574
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,646
- Esme, we got it.
- No. She is right.

575
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,803
You and Arthur are going to
have to share that burden.

576
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,489
But I hope the house
that you can buy with this

577
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,491
can become a place of...

578
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,926
contemplation

579
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,090
and perhaps, redemption.

580
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,125
Charlie, for lost tools
and dangerous goods

581
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,126
and Curly's wise words.

582
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,044
Johnny, for board and lodgings.

583
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,886
Lizzie.

584
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,686
Michael,

585
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,841
for the killings.

586
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,288
Five for cutting and five for shooting.

587
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,600
- No, Tommy.
- What?

588
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,485
Tell me, eh?

589
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,162
This is who I am!

590
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,363
And this is all I can give you
for what you have given to me.

591
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,964
For your hearts and your souls.

592
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,849
Yesterday, I nearly lost my son.

593
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,929
You should fucking understand that.

594
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,561
For what, eh? For what?

595
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,881
For this? For this?

596
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,802
And I know that you all want
me to say that I will change,

597
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,370
that this fucking business will change.

598
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,011
But I've learnt something
these last few days.

599
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,289
Those bastards. Those bastards

600
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,611
are worse than us.

601
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,801
Politicians, fucking judges,
lords and ladies.

602
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,961
They are worse than us.

603
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,249
And they will never admit us
to their palaces

604
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,280
no matter how legitimate we become.

605
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,771
Because of who we are,

606
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,170
because of who we fucking are
because of where we are fucking from.

607
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,321
Is that right, Ada?

608
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,890
Our Ada knows.

609
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,929
She got smart about revolution.

610
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,286
And she knows you have to get
what you want your own way.

611
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,323
Lizzie, I want it known, that money

612
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,205
was for you
because some nights it was you

613
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,324
who stopped my heart from breaking,
no-one else.

614
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,488
And the rest of you,
you took the King's shilling.

615
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,243
You took the King's fucking shilling.

616
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,247
When you take the King's shilling,
the King expects you to kill.

617
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,206
Right, Arthur?

618
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,321
Yeah.

619
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,843
That is how it works. Right, John?

620
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,881
That's right.

621
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,566
That's right, Pol.

622
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,721
That is fucking right.

623
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,481
Tommy...

624
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,686
You've had a bad time.

625
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,126
We understand.

626
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,048
So at an alternative time,

627
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,006
when we have all recovered...

628
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,246
I would like

629
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,931
to put before the family

630
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,246
an alternative view

631
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,163
of the future
of the Shelby Company Limited.

632
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,888
A more hopeful view.

633
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,162
Which I, for one,
would quite like to hear.

634
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,281
As would I.

635
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,565
As would I.

636
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,846
Come on, Arthur.

637
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,169
The train for the dock
leaves in one hour.

638
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,409
Then we'll get the boat to New York,

639
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,800
and it'll all be in the past.

640
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,403
I will be off then, Tom.

641
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,806
I will see you, eh?

642
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,962
I will see you, Brother.

643
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,891
Bye, Curly.

644
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,161
You can go,
but you won't get far, Arthur.

645
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,481
Uh, all right, Tom.

646
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,244
I spoke to Moss last night.

647
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,282
He told me that the
Chief Constable of Birmingham

648
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,728
has issued a warrant for your arrest.

649
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,168
Murder, sedition,

650
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,370
conspiracy to cause explosions.

651
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,361
John, they're coming for you as well.

652
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,083
Murder, conspiracy to cause explosions.

653
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,201
Michael...

654
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,362
- What the fuck?
- ...for the murder of Hughes.

655
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,241
Polly...

656
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,048
Wait a minute,
what the fuck are you...

657
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,805
...the murder of
Chief Inspector Chester Campbell.

658
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,125
Why didn't you
fucking tell us, Tom?

659
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,168
The people we betrayed last night,
they want to bring us down.

660
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,881
They control the police,
they control the judges,

661
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,691
the control the juries,
they control the jails.

662
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,683
But they do not control...

663
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,251
- Look what they did to us.
- ...the elected government.

664
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,209
- Why didn't you tell us before?
- You are my brother.

665
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,486
Listen to me.

666
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,563
So I've made a deal.

667
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,290
- They will hang us!
- In return

668
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,289
for giving evidence against them.

669
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,561
We will fucking hang.

670
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,846
It is all taken care of.

671
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,924
Lizzie, collect up the money
and bring it to the cellar.

672
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,524
You will all get your money
in due course.

673
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,763
When the police gets in, do not resist.

674
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,003
You go with them,
and you do not say anything.

675
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,286
Arthur,

676
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,240
I have made a deal with people even
more powerful than our enemies.

677
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,805
- Arthur!
- Trust me, Brother, eh?

678
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,931
Trust me.

679
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,362
- No, Linda...
- You did this deliberately!

680
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,807
You made this happen to keep us!

681
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,126
Come here. Come here.

682
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,087
Come on now, we
have to run. We have to run.

683
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,886
Fuck you!

684
