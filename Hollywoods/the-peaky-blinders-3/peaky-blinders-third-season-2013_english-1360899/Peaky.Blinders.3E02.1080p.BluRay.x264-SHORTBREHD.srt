1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,047
<i>Thomas Michael Shelby...</i>

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,370
<i>Today is my wedding day.</i>

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,921
Take the photograph!

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,371
<i>- The Russians have made contact.</i>
<i>- On your wedding night.</i>

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,011
Whoever it is up there,
he gave the wrong name.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,764
Can you do it?
Can you kill?

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,450
You know
why he didn't come, don't you?

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,561
My bloody man.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,450
There was a fire at his restaurant.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,847
No fraternizing with the foreigners.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,769
There's a cavalry officer.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,964
In March, we'll be engaged.

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,929
<i>But you want to try things first.</i>

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,489
<i>I'm Ruben Oliver,
portrait artist.</i>

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,041
You have my card.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,601
What was in your heart was beautiful.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,527
just get this business done
and get away from things like this.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,601
Promise me.

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,087
I promise.

20
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,085
I will make us safe.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,883
Your brothers came to my house.

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,130
They said the Peaky Blinders
had business with me.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,487
You're not afraid of me.

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,681
So,

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,881
what is it you want
from a simple working man?

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,801
Fear.

28
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,082
Poor Mr Nutley drank too much.

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,326
He went for a piss on the train tracks
that run behind the factory.

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,280
Train came.

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,687
They found his body in Saltley
broken into bits.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,370
I know what you do.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,811
Tell me what you want.

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,601
There.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,371
The let's complete warehouse.
Bays 4, 5 and 6.

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,846
You have the keys?

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,849
Yes, I have keys.

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,485
What's in Bay 4?

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,962
Completed type 40s and type 21 <i>s</i>
waiting for the paint shop.

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,040
Bay 5?

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,642
- Paint shop and parts.
- Uh-huh.

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,160
So, it's Bay 6.

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,841
What is?

44
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,929
Give me the keys to Bay 6.

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,250
It's just old stock in storage.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,441
Give me the keys to Bay 6.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,766
For your trouble.

48
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,325
Give it to your charity.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,046
I'm only doing this
for the safety of my family.

50
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,489
So, will it be just boys in your
charitable institution or girls as well?

51
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,891
Both.

52
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,326
You must divide them.

53
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,448
You know how the little creatures
can get.

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,364
Where are your people?
You said they'd be here by 5:00.

55
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,804
They are a law unto themselves.

56
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,807
You can never quite grasp who they are.

57
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,210
Like gripping wet soap-

58
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,169
I've done my research.

59
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,050
Erm...

60
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,171
Perhaps you know them
as the, uh, Economic League.

61
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,408
Only once did I get a letter from them
headed "The Vigilance Committee."

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,329
Which tips the hand a little.

63
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,409
No.

64
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,570
The name I've heard is Section D.

65
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,571
That's what Special Branch calls them.

66
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,086
Business men, MPs, army officers.

67
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,448
Yes, it will be fun to bring
such men to a Gypsy scrapyard.

68
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,050
You asked for privacy.

69
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,690
Since the election, the government
has decided that we are the enemy.

70
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,288
When all we're trying to do
is save the country from revolution.

71
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,881
Are you political, Mr Shelby?

72
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,611
Because these Odd Fellows believe

73
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,207
that the time is coming soon
when everyone must choose a side.

74
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,647
Are your people coming
or are they not coming?

75
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,489
Mr Shelby, you will learn that
these men are far too grand

76
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,289
for the clock to govern them.

77
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,923
You'll get used to meeting
in the small hours of the morning.

78
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,806
They're like monks.

79
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,131
So, when is your
charitable institute opening?

80
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,403
When I fucking say.

81
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,250
Well, I'll stop by from time to time

82
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,641
to hear confession
from the little creatures.

83
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,165
You'll meet Mr Patrick Jarvis, MP.

84
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,288
He'll probably want to become a trustee.

85
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,961
It's just his thing, to drop by
in the evenings after a few drinks.

86
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,442
We'll make it a formal arrangement
as part of the bigger deal between us.

87
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,806
I will have an office there.

88
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,047
Ah!

89
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,011
My God. Some devil gets into you,
doesn't it, boy?

90
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,330
Mr Shelby,

91
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,886
if I want to play the squire in your
place of false charity, then I will.

92
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,129
Ambition for respectability
doesn't make you a saint.

93
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,926
Am I wrong?

94
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,723
Oh, Lord. That's 6:00, is it?

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,411
Well, I wish you a good day.

96
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,690
Where the fuck are you going?

97
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,330
Did I not make it clear?

98
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,441
They said if they weren't here
by morning prayers

99
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,329
then the meeting has been cancelled.

100
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,361
Perhaps Mr Jarvis has been held up
at the House of Commons.

101
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,329
Perhaps Admiral Hall's been held up
at the House of Lords.

102
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,805
Am I impressing you?

103
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,725
Or perhaps they have decided
they don't care for doing business

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,962
with Gypsies in scrap metal yards

105
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,601
which would be a poor outcome for you.

106
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,206
You give them a message
from me, Priest.

107
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,760
You tell them I've been to the factories

108
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,686
and the armoured vehicles
are in good condition.

109
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,691
How many?

110
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,085
Twenty-seven.

111
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,803
And the foreman is ours.

112
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,049
This is someone you'll meet.

113
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,489
Today, at the Ritz.

114
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,525
I have meetings today.

115
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,691
You have one meeting, this one.

116
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,720
In London.

117
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,009
So, you'd best catch the milk train.

118
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,121
Cold.

119
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,601
My apologies, sir.

120
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,649
And how many times
I asked you to tell them

121
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,529
about sending us the servant's crockery.

122
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,967
I have no control
over the choice of service, sir.

123
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,601
Hmm, and what about yesterday's eggs
and last year's fish

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,287
and last century's tea leaves
in a cracked pot.

125
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,961
Sir, I have a list of today's social
engagements, if you'd like to hear them.

126
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,326
Oh, are we in a rush today?

127
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,204
- I have duties at the main house, sir.
- Mmm.

128
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,482
Luncheon at The Ritz
with Duke Michail Michailovich.

129
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,291
Cancelled.

130
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,401
- What reason?
- He says he is unwell, sir.

131
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,880
You are due to have tea at 3:00

132
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,851
with Prince Sevlod Ianovich
and Lady Mary Lewington, sir.

133
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,447
Mmm! Good.

134
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,131
I miss out on the bore
and meet the beauty.

135
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,123
However, in the absence of the Duke,

136
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,126
the, er, Prince and the Lady
too have cancelled, sir.

137
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,291
Other than that,
your day is, er, your own.

138
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,569
You do have one business appointment

139
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,728
to discuss automobiles
with a Mr Thomas Shelby, sir.

140
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,925
You asked for a meeting out in the open.

141
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,769
Fresh air and the fine aroma of shit.

142
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,526
"Neutral ground", you said.

143
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,926
This is hardly neutral ground.

144
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,130
Well, it's what you've got.

145
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,880
<i>So, por favor,</i>

146
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,161
sit down.

147
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,609
- Where is Thomas?
- He got called away.

148
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,721
He'd said he'd be here.

149
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,841
Yeah, he is busy.

150
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,401
And I just told you he got called away.
What do you want?

151
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,842
There has been a peace

152
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,170
between the Peaky Blinders

153
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,971
and the Changretta family
for two years now...

154
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,201
Do you want some tea or not?

155
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,724
Here, Finn, pour the Italians
some English tea. Go on.

156
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,769
We don't want fucking tea.

157
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,364
We want an explanation.

158
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
Well, I'll have fucking tea.

159
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,049
Explanation for what?

160
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,810
The Little Venice Restaurant
on Forge Street was burnt down.

161
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,441
No. No. Couldn't have been us,
we was at a wedding.

162
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,606
You burnt it down to stop my son
being at that same wedding.

163
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,041
He wasn't missed.

164
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,609
You are such big boys now.

165
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,280
But once you borrowed clothes from us
to look like men.

166
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,848
How's the tea, Arthur? Is it...

167
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,325
It's cold.

168
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,769
Please tell Tommy

169
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,920
that we pay him
whatever he asks us to pay.

170
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,810
We stay out of the city
and off the tracks.

171
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,808
But you tell him from me

172
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,408
that my son will walk
with any woman in this city.

173
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,250
Any woman he chooses.

174
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,486
Even if that woman works
for the emperor, Thomas Shelby.

175
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,610
My son is in love...

176
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,291
Sorry. Do excuse me.

177
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,247
Carry on.

178
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,363
And if he wishes,
he will walk with the woman he loves.

179
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,841
OK.

180
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,806
You know...

181
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,721
It would be hard for your son
to walk anywhere

182
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,881
with a bullet in each knee, wouldn't it?

183
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,121
Too much.

184
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,567
You said too much, my friend.

185
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,205
Sabini says, "Suck and swallow." But no.

186
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,321
Too much.

187
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,568
I spit.

188
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,211
Oh. OK. A bit strong.

189
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,160
- Fucking hell.
- Isiah.

190
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,965
Put two extra men on our pubs
in Nechells.

191
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,085
What are you talking about, Arthur?

192
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,129
We're not scared of
fucking Eyeties any more.

193
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,523
Don't tell Tommy about the chair
and clean this fucking shit up.

194
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,481
We're not scared of fucking wops!

195
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,005
All right, John.

196
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,331
Arthur!

197
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,886
Hello, Ada.

198
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,604
Tommy Shelby? In a library?

199
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,524
I need to borrow a book
about the Russian Revolution.

200
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,167
Have you got a new wharf
at Maida Vale now?

201
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,483
I've got a new wharf
everywhere now.

202
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,888
Sometimes, I see our trucks
driving past.

203
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,641
"Our" trucks?

204
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,450
Shelby trucks.

205
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,531
Why the interest?

206
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,361
I just want to broaden my mind.

207
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,685
Well, this is a list of the bastards
who ran away.

208
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,526
And this is written from the point of
view of the peoples' struggle.

209
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,806
Uh-huh.

210
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,524
There was a Russian
at your wedding.

211
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,482
He wouldn't tell me
how come he got invited.

212
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,040
Well, sometimes,
exiled Russian aristocrats get invited

213
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,442
to social occasions to add
a bit of class.

214
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,131
Is that why he was there?

215
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,811
Why do you want to know?

216
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,771
He was nice.
Maybe I'd like to see him again.

217
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,285
Would that be possible?

218
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,571
No. That would not be possible.

219
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,961
What business do you have
with the Russians, Tommy?

220
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,561
Can I rip this page out?

221
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,130
No, you cannot rip that page out.

222
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,565
Property of the people.

223
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,290
Tommy, when Arthur
took the Russian away,

224
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,805
he had his killing pistol
under his jacket.

225
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,121
And then johnny lit a fire in the woods.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,360
You want all the details
because you're bored, Ada.

227
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,726
You used to chase rats
with a revolver, Ada.

228
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,689
For fuck's sake.

229
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,320
I might just have a job for you
after all.

230
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,089
Did we run Kempton yesterday or not?

231
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,091
Danny Lee got drunk.

232
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,370
Instead of injecting the horses
with cocaine,

233
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,930
he decided to share it with his cousins.

234
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,043
Jesus Christ.

235
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,123
He's your brother-in-law.

236
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,083
Tell Esme to speak to him about it.

237
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,524
Look. Before I start...

238
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,482
I don't want you to do anything
about this.

239
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,926
About what?

240
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,321
Vicente Changretta's son.

241
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,363
- The one Lizzie was stepping out with...
- What, Angel?

242
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,528
He's no bigger
than twopence worth of change.

243
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,251
Well, he heard you threatened him
directly to shoot him in the knees.

244
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,526
And now he's going around Nechells

245
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,011
telling everybody
he's going to kill you.

246
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,803
This is Lizzie's fault to start with,
Tommy's for leaving it up to you.

247
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,285
What are you talking about?

248
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,840
We run London.

249
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,208
We run the north,
we run the whole fucking country.

250
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,607
What do we care about
some fucking Nechells Green Eyeties?

251
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,206
We don't need to be getting involved
in all these little piss pots.

252
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,601
What does Arthur say?

253
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,843
That's why I'm here and not him.

254
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,684
If he said it, there'd be a fight.

255
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,521
He says,

256
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,281
"Apologise."

257
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,890
He fucking said what?

258
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,083
We own the city.

259
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,727
But we don't need to rub
everybody's noses in it.

260
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,650
If the old man decides to make a stand,

261
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,290
he might get Sabini
feeling sentimental...

262
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,885
Sabini's done.

263
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,091
They're all done.

264
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,323
And they all pay up.

265
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,731
But we don't want rebellions.

266
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,441
What does, erm, Tommy say?

267
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,927
Tommy's busy. He left me in charge.

268
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,640
And what do you say?

269
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,043
- Compromise.
- Mmm-hmm.

270
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,170
I've asked Lizzie to do it for you.

271
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,967
She's going to meet him,
break up with him for good,

272
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,520
apologise for any inconvenience,
say it was all her fault...

273
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,011
For fuck's sake!

274
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,450
You know what all this is?

275
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,324
This is Arthur's fucking missus.

276
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,649
Turn the other fucking cheek?

277
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,443
We'll be handing out Bibles in the
fucking Bull Ring with her cousins.

278
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,286
John, you don't have to do anything.
Lizzie will do it for you.

279
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,842
Then it'll all calm down
and nobody will lose face.

280
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,649
I'll take his fucking face.
How about that?

281
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,449
John, do nothing...

282
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,126
I believe you have a reservation
for a private room

283
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,611
in the name of Mr Romanov.

284
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,005
You work for Mr Romanov?

285
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,887
- Yes.
- For his household or his office?

286
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,884
Is there a problem?

287
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,122
I'm afraid without the presence
of the Duke Mikhail Michailovich

288
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,969
or Lady Lewington, we shall have to ask
for payment in advance.

289
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,801
Can I ask why?

290
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,409
Already, Mr Romanov
has four outstanding bills with us.

291
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,928
One for accommodation
and three for dining.

292
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,090
And two banquets, which we wrote off.

293
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,648
We've been asked to be understanding
of our Russian friends by His Majesty.

294
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,007
But it has been some time now...

295
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,608
- May I ask your name, sir?
- Shelby.

296
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,810
Thomas Shelby, and in the future
I will be dining here quite a bit.

297
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,004
Then I shall put you
on our special list.

298
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,127
You do that.

299
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,651
Here is a menu.

300
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,727
I recommend the teal and the pork.

301
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,131
Although your guest, I'm sure,
will order the caviar.

302
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,046
Myself and my wife and my niece
travelled by train,

303
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,409
then coach, then on foot
through the Villa Ai-Todor in Crimea.

304
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,051
On that journey I lost a toe.

305
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,247
I don't know, I woke up one morning
and it was gone.

306
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,767
All of a sudden I saw a dog,
and it was eating it.

307
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,603
They said the British
had taken pity on us,

308
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,762
and we were taken aboard
<i>HMS Marlborough.</i>

309
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,284
I immediately kissed the steel deck,
my lips froze to it.

310
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,042
And then, of course, I thanked God
and your King for saving us.

311
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,046
Though since then,
he has done nothing but humiliate me.

312
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,087
Who? God or the King?

313
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,645
Sometimes both, Mr Shelby.

314
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,849
Mmm, so, you met my niece already?

315
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,050
Tatiana.

316
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,127
Are you in love with her yet, hmm?

317
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,882
You would be wise
not to love Russian women, you know.

318
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,889
Ah, better not speak of Russian women.

319
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,850
Mmm... That is the worst thing
about being here.

320
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,846
Russian women, they know how to hold it

321
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,160
and most important,
they know exactly when to let it go.

322
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,769
Your cock, I mean.

323
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,011
English women, they do not know so much.
You know?

324
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,847
Did he die well, the spy?

325
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,970
He begged for his life.

326
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,802
I heard you had your brother do it.

327
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,489
So you trust your family, like me.

328
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,803
Like us, Mr Shelby.

329
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,526
Let's talk about trust then, shall we?

330
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,405
You are not a direct relation
to the Romanovs, you are Georgian.

331
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,607
And the palace where you live
in Hampton Court

332
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,564
is, in fact, a grace and favour house

333
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,122
donated to you, rent-free
by the British Crown.

334
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,245
The maître d' here, tells me
that you are in some debt.

335
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,281
Both here and other places, I imagine.

336
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,369
See, I've been given 10,
but I've been promised 40.

337
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,204
Already, I have had to
have a man killed.

338
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,128
That sort of work does not come cheap.

339
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,965
Do you understand?

340
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,962
Let me tell you something, Mr Shelby.

341
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,970
Before we boarded the ship,

342
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,806
my niece sewed 16 diamonds
into her velvet dress,

343
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,044
and also she had two sapphires
in her intimate places.

344
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,490
My wife managed two sapphires
and five diamonds.

345
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,922
This is already
for the killing of the spy

346
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,211
and a down payment on future services.

347
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,887
Now, tell me,
where do you keep these things?

348
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,286
In a bank?

349
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,560
How could we plead poverty
around London society

350
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,041
if we used banks, Mr Shelby?

351
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,809
Well, you should know...

352
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,525
Hatton Gardens is not safe.

353
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,848
That's why we have our own treasury.

354
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,966
Very well, I shall have
my people check its veracity.

355
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,689
Before the revolution began,
we were soft and weak.

356
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,811
We made compromise.

357
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,245
But let me tell you.

358
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,244
We will never be soft and weak again.

359
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,570
Do you understand?

360
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,326
Good day, Mr Shelby.

361
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,368
This way, Mr Changretta.

362
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,289
just there, sir. There.

363
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,010
Are you going to kill me?

364
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,489
Get fucking up.

365
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,005
Stay away from Lizzie!

366
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,130
By order of the Peaky fucking Blinders!

367
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,324
Going to introduce me, Michael?

368
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,243
This is Charlotte Murray.
Her father makes cars.

369
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,967
I really enjoyed your wedding,
Mr Shelby.

370
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,930
Polly said that you should call her.
There's been some trouble.

371
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,326
What trouble?

372
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,805
I'm guessing it's stuff
she doesn't like to tell me about.

373
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,206
Nice to meet you.

374
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,807
All right, Finn.
Thanks for coming. Fuck off.

375
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,408
Finn, you can stay.

376
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,488
Sit down, John.

377
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,766
Sit down.

378
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,923
John, you cut Angel Changretta.

379
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,082
Even though Arthur told you
to apologise.

380
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,207
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,721
- Polly told you to compromise.
Mmm-hmm.

382
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,522
You chose not to listen to Mr Apologise
or Mrs Compromise.

383
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,005
And now I have got an Italian
walking around my backyard

384
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,088
saying he's going to kill my brother.

385
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,043
So what do we do, John.
Do we apologise or do we compromise?

386
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,971
Oh, it was just something
John said as a joke.

387
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,249
Yeah, but he's your brother
as well, Arthur.

388
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,006
Yeah.

389
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,205
I know I didn't want to start a war

390
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,408
over something John said
without meaning it.

391
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,001
So, should he apologise in Italian
or in English?

392
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,484
Or should we ask them
which fucking language they prefer?

393
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,966
I'm not clear.

394
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,129
You said while this business
was going on in London,

395
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,281
you wanted peace at home.

396
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,930
And the only way to guarantee peace

397
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,924
is by making the prospect of war
seem hopeless.

398
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,644
If you apologise once,
you do it again and again and again.

399
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,161
Like taking bricks out of the wall
of your fucking house.

400
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,850
Do you want
to bring the house down, Arthur?

401
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,968
If you're soft on rebellion, it'll grow.

402
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,963
Bloody "soft on rebellion".

403
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,929
You did the right thing, John.

404
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,286
Now, we go on the offensive.

405
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,648
We take two of the Changretta pubs,
and we take them tonight. That's it.

406
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,007
Oh! Right. For Christ's sake, why?

407
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,241
- Hey.
- Why?

408
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,163
Why? Because we fucking can.

409
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,603
Because we fucking can
and if we can, we do.

410
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,766
And if we lift our heel off their necks
now, they’ll just come at us.

411
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,726
Remember these are the bastards
that wanted Danny Whizz-Bang dead.

412
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,730
You're getting soft, brother.

413
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,205
Soft and weak.

414
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,968
Save the Bible for Sundays, eh.

415
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,326
Finn?

416
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,321
I need to get to Hockley and then home.

417
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,209
It's been a long day.

418
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,648
You take the Wrexham,
you take the Five Bells.

419
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,485
You get them signed over to us
in the morning.

420
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,210
You make sure the coppers stay away.

421
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,691
Don't use the fucking phones, all right?
There's someone listening.

422
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,651
Well done.

423
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,405
Hmm.

424
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,924
Not hungry, Mrs Shelby?

425
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,283
"Hungry"? Oh, no. Sorry, Mary.

426
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,571
You'll ruin your eyes.

427
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,561
Tommy...

428
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,484
- Hello.
- Hello.

429
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,649
Sit down.

430
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,288
- Guess.
- Guess what?

431
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,209
- He said yes.
- Who?

432
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,891
The leader of the Birmingham City
Council is going to attend the dinner.

433
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,049
- Everyone has said yes. Everyone.
- Ah.

434
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,327
I keep having to change the catering.

435
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,847
And my writing hand is almost
falling off.

436
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,969
Oh, what are you writing for?
I bought you a typewriter.

437
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,847
You don't write letters
of a social occasion on a typewriter.

438
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,366
Oh. Forgive me.

439
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,250
I have the drawings

440
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,130
of what they plan to do
with the grounds of the house.

441
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,806
There'll be an area
for the children to play. Look.

442
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,006
Mmm-hmm.

443
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,447
And the Birmingham Charity Commission
have agreed to set aside

444
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,048
their three rotten floorboards upstairs
and grant us the licence within a month.

445
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,848
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes I am. I am.

446
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,720
Do you think I'm becoming obsessed?

447
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,801
Yes.

448
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,647
Should I ask you how your day was,
like a good wife?

449
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,281
No.

450
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,449
I'm guessing that means your day
was not as successful as mine, hmm.

451
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,850
That all depends
on how you measure success.

452
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,322
See, personally,

453
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,045
I measure it in sapphires.

454
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,805
Oh!

455
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,801
- Sapphires. Mmm.
- Uh-huh.

456
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,724
Close your eyes.

457
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,364
Close your eyes.

458
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,922
All right, you can open 'em.

459
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,121
Where the hell did you get that?

460
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,881
It's beautiful.

461
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,362
You can wear it to the
foundation dinner.

462
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,926
Don't you think it's a bit much
for a charity dinner?

463
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,406
Grace,

464
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,009
this is fucking Birmingham.

465
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,402
"Good taste" is for people
who can't afford sapphires.

466
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,724
Oh, Mr Shelby.

467
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,767
Did you wind the clock, Arthur?

468
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,564
We should go to bed.

469
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,651
I need to...

470
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,370
I need to go out.

471
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,082
Some business I need to do.

472
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,891
"Business"?

473
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,724
But you only just got in.

474
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,921
I won't be long.

475
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,365
It's 10 o'clock.

476
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,491
It's pouring with rain.

477
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,326
I'll go...

478
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,964
I'll go and I'll come back.

479
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,761
Arthur.

480
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,171
Working in the dark is for the devil.

481
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,530
We said.

482
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,482
Start to do your work in the light.

483
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,605
Your own light.

484
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,410
Inside your head.

485
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,604
It's just paperwork.

486
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,927
I need you to clear your men
out of Nechells tonight.

487
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,526
I thought you boys were a bit grand
for this sort of thing these days.

488
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,681
Moss.

489
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,322
Mind you,
I think Tommy enjoys the sport.

490
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,211
Something like that.

491
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,970
Good night, Arthur.

492
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,201
Night.

493
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,565
Arthur, what are you doing?

494
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,160
Arthur?

495
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,328
We're going to the Garrison.

496
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,006
No. I'm going home, John.

497
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,723
Go and fuck yourself, Arthur.

498
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,445
Yeah! Fuck off!

499
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,884
- Come here, Charlie.
- Charlie.

500
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,249
This big man and his brother
are going to make us a lot of money.

501
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,880
Or lose us a lot of money.

502
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,482
Who the hell cares
when they are such beautiful beasts, eh?

503
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,681
Go on.

504
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,040
- You've got a house, John.
- Oh, fuck.

505
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,321
Full of kids.

506
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,050
Well, you've got a maid
to look after the kids.

507
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,531
Yeah, she listens.

508
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,888
Have you done the odds
for tomorrow?

509
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,088
Something urgent came up.

510
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,481
They get worse
when they're pregnant, Tom.

511
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,481
John.

512
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,923
Esme, I need you to leave now.
Go out the back door,

513
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,280
and lock it after you.

514
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,404
Come on, I left the office.

515
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,845
There's two trucks full of coppers
out there, John.

516
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,841
Where the fuck is Arthur?

517
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,651
He goes home to the Madonna of Moseley
on the stroke of five.

518
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,530
- You need to talk to him, Tom.
- Esme, please, go. Now.

519
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,761
Please.

520
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,731
This is very fucking unusual.

521
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,006
So, call Moss.

522
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,602
They're from out of town.
London, by the looks of their boots.

523
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,091
Since when are we
scared of coppers, Tom?

524
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,600
Since things changed, John.

525
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,009
- Scotland Yard!
- Get down! Police!

526
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,684
- Go on!
- John!

527
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,008
John! John, it's the Yard.

528
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,407
Put it down.

529
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,606
Putting it down.
Putting it fucking down.

530
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,126
- Hands on your heads!
- Down on your knees! Now!

531
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,047
Let her fucking go!
She's fucking pregnant.

532
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,161
Leave her alone.

533
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,685
What the fuck is happening, Tom?

534
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,888
Let's go.

535
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,566
Put me down!

536
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,883
- Tell Polly it's Russian business, John.
- All right.

537
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,645
Peaky fucking Blinders my arse.

538
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,366
- Is he afraid?
- No.

539
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,610
Go on.

540
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,441
Sit.

541
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,161
I'm talking to you, Mr Shelby.

542
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,490
So, the Odd Fellows want you to know
that any deviation

543
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,450
from your instructions
will have consequences.

544
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,161
What's your dog's name?

545
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,845
You visited your sister.

546
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,243
Eh? What's your name, boy?

547
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,371
Your sister is a potential
security breach.

548
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,090
She has connections
with the Bolsheviks in London

549
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,562
who have connections
with the Soviet Embassy.

550
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,603
I think
I will just call your dog, "Boy".

551
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,841
You love your Boy, don't you?

552
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,885
Understand this.

553
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,010
You have the local police
in your pocket,

554
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,163
we have Scotland Yard.

555
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,643
They do what we tell them
just as surely as this dog.

556
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,806
Let him off the leash.

557
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,203
Are you hearing me, Mr Shelby?

558
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,768
I can charm dogs.

559
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,450
Gypsy witchcraft.

560
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,927
And those I can't charm,
I can kill with my own hands.

561
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,562
You learn it
when you have a dog on a boat.

562
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,927
They go fucking mad in tunnels.

563
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,447
I feel like I'm in a tunnel now.

564
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,726
You know that feeling,
when you have to kill or be killed?

565
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,484
Let the dog off the leash

566
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,361
and give the order you give in Gaelic...

567
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,121
Like I'm told you do

568
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,807
when someone displeases you
or someone reports you.

569
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,327
Visit your sister again
and she will die crossing the road.

570
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,525
Then you say it.

571
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,524
If you wanted me dead,
I would be dead, wouldn't I?

572
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,925
It's true.

573
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,889
It's true, we do need you alive.

574
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,402
But when you go home today,
Mr Shelby...

575
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,566
Be sure to check
under your little boy's pillow.

576
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,602
The tooth fairy has been.

577
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,204
We can reach anyone.

578
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,960
Anywhere.

579
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,721
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

580
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,929
Everything's fine. Everything's fine.

581
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,561
Yeah.

582
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,127
You promised, Tommy.

583
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,649
I trust you.

584
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,204
- I trust you, Tommy.
- Yes.

585
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,810
He's fine. He's fine.

586
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,168
Grace. Grace.

587
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,810
Come On.

588
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,489
You're not one of those
Impressionists, are you?

589
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,284
They're all terribly political,
aren't they?

590
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,204
- And you're not?
- Goodness no.

591
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,969
The people I work for just
want me to paint what is there.

592
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,691
To me, politics is deliberately
making things better

593
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,491
for some people by deliberately
making them worse for others.

594
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,530
Well, I thought I might wear this.

595
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,608
Oh, God. It's too much.
I'll try something more simple.

596
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,404
No. Don't...

597
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,687
Suddenly, I feel incompetent.

598
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,404
I want the portrait to hang in the
office, so I want it to look formal.

599
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,084
It's not formal.

600
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,445
It's beautiful.

601
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,606
It was made in Paris.

602
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,844
It was stolen in Birmingham.

603
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,642
My mother stole it from a house
she was cleaning. 1901.

604
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,131
No. No.

605
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,964
It's yours. It belongs on you.

606
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,447
A woman of substance and class.

607
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,568
Believe me. I've painted many women

608
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,722
who don't belong
in their expensive dresses.

609
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,200
There'll be no charge.

610
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,530
Your normal rate.

611
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,122
- I insist.
- Hmm! There's a first.

612
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,126
- So, when shall we start?
- I've already started.

613
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,964
Come to my studio this evening.

614
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,606
- Uh, I am busy this evening.
- Polly, invite him.

615
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,641
Invite me to what?

616
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,722
Ada, this is a professional transaction.

617
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,246
- Invite me to what?
- Shelby Foundation dinner.

618
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,607
- Polly's going alone. You're invited...
- Ada.

619
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,480
I'll come to your studio on Sunday.

620
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,448
And then we shall begin.

621
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,124
A woman of substance...

622
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,491
...and class.

623
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,802
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

624
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,121
Hello.

625
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,841
Hello, Polly.

626
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,326
Tommy.

627
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,567
Here's the leader
of the Birmingham City Council.

628
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,125
- Hello, Tommy.
- Hi, Danny.

629
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,486
How's business?

630
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,688
All right, it's holding up,
holding up. How are you?

631
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,326
You know each other?

632
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,169
I have interests
in a steelworks in Cradley Heath.

633
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,722
Tommy helps me get my products
to the carmakers.

634
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,651
Congratulations, Mrs Shelby,
on your wedding.

635
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,961
Thank you,
I'm surprised you weren't invited.

636
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,929
Now, how would that look, eh?

637
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,490
Oh, now, the party has really started.

638
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,721
Who are they?

639
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,601
Father John Hughes
from St Mary's Boys Reformatory.

640
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,889
And with him is Mr Patrick Jarvis, MP.

641
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,807
They are part of an organisation
called the Economic League.

642
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,609
Did you invite them, Grace?

643
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,290
Their names sound familiar.

644
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,003
They were recommended by the Lord Mayor.

645
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,289
Oh. On your
"best people of the city" list, eh?

646
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,847
- Do you know them?
- I'll introduce you, Tommy.

647
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,322
That's all right, Danny.
I'll introduce myself.

648
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,006
We appear to have taken you by surprise.

649
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,170
I have adjusted.

650
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,047
Since the socialists
got into Downing Street

651
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,326
we are all being followed.

652
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,687
We have to meet in places
where we'd meet anyway.

653
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,091
You should have stopped by Small Heath.

654
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,049
I could have given you
a more traditional welcome.

655
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,647
- They want to know about ammunition.
- And chains for the wheels.

656
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,200
When the White Guard
make their run for Tbilisi,

657
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,884
it will be over rough terrain.

658
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,647
The chains are
suitable for snow or wet ground.

659
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,529
They're already stored on the vehicles.

660
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,489
There's a batch of weapons
set aside at the BSA,

661
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,324
which is bound for the Turkish army.

662
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,927
And how will you get it all aboard
the London train?

663
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,241
There will be a strike that night
across the city.

664
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,571
You will have to stop
the train twice. How?

665
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,250
Two drivers will join the strike
at different points.

666
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,251
Rather fun, getting the Communist unions
to help get weapons to the Whites.

667
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,845
Yes, rather fun, eh?

668
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,362
I am thinking ahead,
thinking of every possibility,

669
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,249
remembering everything
that is happening.

670
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,561
The Russians want to inspect
the vehicles.

671
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,361
- I'll take photographs.
Mmm-mmm.

672
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,489
The Duke has sent his niece, she's here.

673
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,131
Tomorrow you will take her to the
factory and show her.

674
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,886
No. Union conveners
are watching the factories.

675
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,807
Not possible.

676
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,209
Anything is possible, Mr Shelby.

677
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,964
You will take her.

678
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,321
You will pick her up
from this hotel at ten.

679
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,650
Now, look, a priest with an empty glass.

680
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,162
Let's get back to the party.

681
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,160
You know, gentlemen, there is hell
and there is another place below hell.

682
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,008
I will remember everything...

683
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,649
And forget nothing.

684
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,606
Tommy,

685
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,887
this is Duchess Tatiana Petrovna.

686
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,602
Come on, Tommy, aren't you impressed
to meet a real duchess?

687
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,723
Well, I understand they charge a fee.

688
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,725
Mr Shelby,
you are very direct.

689
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,086
Too direct.

690
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,366
But it's true.

691
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,321
I attend these things for the champagne.

692
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,881
And for the chance
to be treated like a duchess again.

693
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,925
You should have kissed my hand,
Mr Shelby.

694
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,525
Forgive me.

695
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,724
She was asking about my sapphire.

696
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,804
- I thought I recognised it.
- She said it was Russian.

697
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,770
My husband has business in Russia.
Perhaps you know about it, Tatiana?

698
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,649
Well, tonight is not a night
for business, eh?

699
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,688
Is that why you were in the concert hall
for 10 minutes?

700
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,046
I think people are ready
for dinner now, Grace.

701
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,322
No, no. I'm not done
pumping people for money.

702
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,931
What is "pump for money"?

703
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,048
It's what I do every day.

704
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,404
You know each other, do you?

705
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,408
You see, I am in charge
of compiling the list of guests,

706
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,767
but it's my husband
who seems to know all of them.

707
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,365
I hear he is very well connected.

708
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,329
And where does a duchess hear that?

709
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,527
In certain circles.

710
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,840
All right, enough. Ada.

711
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,530
Grace, there's a Lady Dowager

712
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,648
who wants to speak to you
about coffee mornings.

713
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,961
She mentioned a £2,000 cash donation.

714
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,248
Tatiana, you and I will speak later.

715
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,845
I would like that.

716
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,242
Going to the factory tomorrow
is a mistake.

717
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,964
Nevertheless, we will go.

718
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,682
Also, my uncle ordered me to seduce you
to give us an advantage.

719
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,286
But with a beautiful wife like that
it will be difficult, no?

720
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,850
Tomorrow is a mistake.

721
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,680
Have you not heard?
We have no morals, we Russians.

722
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,961
And no fucking sense.

723
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,565
And no options.

724
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,283
I would fuck you for the cause.
What do you think of that?

725
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,527
I think you should not drink
vodka with champagne.

726
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,327
Does your wife know
that the sapphire she is wearing

727
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,448
has been cursed by a Gypsy?

728
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,641
What did you say?

729
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,169
Nothing on Earth would make me wear it.

730
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,162
Grace, listen to me.
Look, I can explain.

731
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,361
- Go away.
- It's...

732
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,646
Ladies and gentlemen.

733
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,881
For once, you shouldn't have to explain.

734
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,328
The loyalty toast,
to His Majesty the King.

735
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,204
To the King.

736
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,125
Dinner is served.

737
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,368
You look beautiful,
but you need to take this off.

738
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,010
Why? Because you think
it would look better on her?

739
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,811
Grace, look at me,
fuck these people, eh.

740
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,963
Fuck 'em, I need you to be all right.

741
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,762
I need you, Grace. I need you.

742
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,321
Damn you, Tommy Shelby.

743
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,765
- Shall we go inside?
- Yeah.

744
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,325
For Angel!

745
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,883
Get me a fucking ambulance now!

746
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:09,500
