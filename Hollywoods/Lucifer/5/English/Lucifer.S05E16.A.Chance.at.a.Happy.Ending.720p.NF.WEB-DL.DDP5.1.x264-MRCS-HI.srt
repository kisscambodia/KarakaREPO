1
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,116
Yo, boss! Johnny's gotta make water!

2
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,409
No chance, man. Shut up!

3
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,497
Oh, he's peeing!
Johnny's peeing all over the seat!

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,957
[prisoner] What are you
fucking around for, man?

5
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,751
[guard] Damn it, Johnny!

6
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,837
[prisoners chattering]

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,840
- [guard] Really? What's your problem, man?
- [grunting]

8
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,177
- [straining]
- [prisoner] Get him down!

9
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,388
[grunting]

10
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,807
[shouts]

11
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,143
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]

12
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,645
[engine revving]

13
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,396
[grunting]

14
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,111
[shouting]

15
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,570
[screaming]

16
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,329
[metal creaking]

17
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,766
- [chattering]
- [laughing]

18
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,954
[piano playing off-key]

19
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,505
[Michael] You know,
I always wondered why a piano.

20
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,342
You're supposed to be the edgy one.
Wouldn't a guitar be more, uh...

21
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,888
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Lucifer! Lucifer. Lucifer.

22
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,598
I am not here to fight.

23
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,600
Oh, well, I am most certainly am!

24
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,102
[panting] Well, then what would happen

25
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,690
to all these poor,
fragile humans, dear brother?

26
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,696
[gasps]

27
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,323
It's all right, everyone!

28
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,367
Just a little brotherly squabble.
[chuckles]

29
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,579
- It's fine. It's fine. Music up.
- [dance music playing]

30
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,625
[Michael] And besides,
I mean, really, what's the point?

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,043
I've already won.

32
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,420
I've assembled the Flaming Sword,

33
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,090
and thanks to it, and...
[chuckles]...my charms, of course,

34
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,593
I have got
the majority of angels on my side.

35
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,846
And yet, here you are. Why?

36
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,723
To avoid bloodshed, brother.

37
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,602
To keep our siblings safe. To make peace.

38
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,482
I am here with an offer.

39
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,110
[scoffs]
There is nothing that you could offer me.

40
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,571
Hmm. [chuckles]

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,615
What about a throne?

42
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,451
[laughs]

43
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,662
Are you offering me my old job?

44
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:11,084
I take Heaven. You take Hell.
It's kind of poetic if you think about it.

45
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,963
And, uh, I will let you rule down there
however you see fit.

46
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,966
Oh, gee, thanks, bro.

47
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,176
But been there, done that, tried the veal.

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,680
Ah-ah-ah!
But I haven't told you the best part.

49
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,766
Chloe will be down there with you.

50
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,103
I mean, talk about happily ever after.

51
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,897
What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

52
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,568
Even if you become God, you wouldn't have
the power to force her soul down there.

53
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,321
Only someone's guilt
can take them to Hell.

54
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,698
Exactly.

55
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,200
Think about it.

56
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,830
The father of her child is dead
because of a case he was working for her.

57
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,794
Did you do all of this?

58
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,171
Did you have them take Daniel?

59
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,175
No, no, no.
That part was just a very happy accident.

60
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,220
But when they
told me they had him... [laughs]

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,432
oh, brother,
I realized I had a golden opportunity.

62
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,183
So you...

63
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,562
you told <i>them</i> to kill Dan?

64
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,771
You're welcome.

65
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,024
- [Lucifer inhales]
- [grunts]

66
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,819
[chuckles] Easy with the temper, brother.

67
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,404
Dan is in Hell because of you!

68
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,990
Well, technically,
it's because of his own guilt,

69
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,992
which he really
should've gotten over by now.

70
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,660
[shouts]

71
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,912
Forget about the past, brother.

72
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,998
Focus on the future.

73
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,750
Your future.

74
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,752
With Chloe.

75
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,132
[chuckles]

76
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,097
[Michael] You need time
to think about it. I get it.

77
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,101
But just so you know,
the vote is tomorrow.

78
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,729
And I'm holding it here on Earth
so you can attend.

79
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,690
You know, because of the whole
"you're banished from Heaven

80
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,526
and would be instantly incinerated
if you returned" thing.

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,905
[chuckles] Though,
that would be fun to see.

82
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,823
Brother.

83
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,954
I am offering you
a chance at a happy ending.

84
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,333
I hope you take it.

85
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,362
Linda.

86
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,032
[chuckles]

87
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,993
See?

88
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,622
This is what caring about people gets you.

89
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,459
Sitting around like idiots,
getting all emotional over inanimate junk!

90
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:03,423
So can we please just stop with
the crybaby bullshit and get this done?

91
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,973
[gasps]

92
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,981
[shouts]

93
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,528
[Linda] Maze.

94
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,531
Maze, honey, it's gonna be okay.

95
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,741
What is that?

96
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,663
[sobbing] It's the T-shirt that Dan...

97
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,334
had to steal from Chloe
after I knocked him out

98
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,921
and dumped him naked at her house.

99
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,633
[sobbing] I still...

100
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,429
I still don't know
how he fit his stupid ass in this thing.

101
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,557
[chuckles, sobbing]

102
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,937
I miss him.

103
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,315
- [crying]
- [Linda] Maze.

104
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,108
[sighs] Okay.

105
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,194
[wailing]

106
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,612
Okay.

107
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,740
It's okay.

108
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,701
Okay.

109
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,703
It's true.

110
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,000
It's true,
sometimes when you care about people...

111
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,546
you have to go through pain and loss.

112
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,634
But that's the price of joy.

113
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,012
[Amenadiel] She's right, Mazikeen.

114
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,017
In order for none of us to be sad,
we would have had to have never met Dan.

115
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,729
You wouldn't want that. None of us would.

116
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,190
[sobbing] Mnh-mnh.

117
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,777
Like... like when...

118
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,447
when Dan and I

119
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,908
pul... pulverized that gang together.

120
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,995
It was beautiful.

121
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,250
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

122
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,125
Exactly.

123
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,296
And remembering, um...

124
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,384
sweet times like those...

125
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,429
are what helps heal the hurt.

126
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,185
[Linda] Because trust me...

127
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:28,359
never loving anyone
is far worse than loss.

128
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,288
[elevator bell dings]

129
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,794
[Lucifer] Thank you for coming, Detective.

130
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,463
- Yeah.
- Um, how's Trixie?

131
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:56,012
Uh, she's, you know,
she's with my mom and Dan's parents.

132
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,388
She's a strong little girl.

133
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,349
She's just having to be stronger
than she ever should right now.

134
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,770
Listen, I know
that you asked me to come here,

135
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,275
but I just wanna get
something off my chest first. Um...

136
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,321
You know the argument
the other night, it...

137
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,827
It just... we were both stressed,
and, um, it was emotional and...

138
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,204
There's no need, Detective.
You were right.

139
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,043
You were able to say
the thing I couldn't admit to myself.

140
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,879
I wanted to be God for the wrong reasons.

141
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,259
But now I know why I <i>need</i> to be God.

142
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,387
For Dan's sake.

143
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,305
What do you mean?

144
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,893
Uh, please. Sit down, please.

145
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,981
[clears throat]

146
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,401
[Chloe clears throat]

147
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,071
So, Dan's...

148
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,658
Dan's death... [exhales]

149
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,286
Everything that's happened
is all Michael's fault.

150
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,456
He's been assembling
the Flaming Sword to win the war.

151
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,460
So that's why they killed Dan,
to keep us from finding that out?

152
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,462
No.

153
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,714
No.

154
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,675
Michael killed Dan...

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,552
so that you would feel guilty.

156
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,307
So that when you die,
you'll go down to Hell.

157
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,852
A twisted bribe to get me
to go back like a good little Devil.

158
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,272
I don't even know...

159
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,192
I don't know what to do with that!

160
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,777
You must refuse to give in.

161
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,987
It's all a manipulation.

162
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,490
Detective, you mustn't feel guilty.

163
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,120
Right. Yeah, okay. [sniffles]

164
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,497
I'll just snap my fingers
and not feel guilty.

165
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,457
- I'm serious, Detective.
- I'm serious too.

166
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,252
That is not how emotions work, Lucifer.

167
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,380
Prove me wrong. Go ahead!

168
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,006
Go on! Just...

169
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,884
[inhales]...feel worthy!

170
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,678
[gasping]

171
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,514
Or you know what?
No, this is better. This is better.

172
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,686
Make yourself vulnerable.

173
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,231
- [Lucifer sighs]
- [chuckles]

174
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,571
- It's easier said than done, isn't it?
- This isn't the same.

175
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,491
[inhales] We can't let Michael win,
and you can't end up like Dan.

176
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,870
What are you talking about,

Remiel.

185

She's dead.

188

Oh, my God.

189
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,590
Michael must have
found out she was our spy

190
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,509
and killed her with the Flaming Sword.

191
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,763
Wait, are there
actual flames on the sword?

192
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,809
Detective, this is hardly the time to
start questioning the rules of celestials,

193
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,562
but, yes, the sword has flames on it.
It makes sense. Don't overthink it.

194
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,191
No, I'm only asking because, look,
there's no burn marks around the wound,

195
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,361
so whatever Michael killed her with,
it couldn't have been flaming.

196
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,030
So he must have just used Azrael's blade.

197
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,867
But when I saw Michael,
he said he had the sword.

198
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:52,540
If he did, the little show-off would have
used it, which means he's bluffing.

00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,415
What about Remiel? What about our sister?

352
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,625
Does it matter to you
that Michael murdered her?

353
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,793
That can't be true.

354
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,422
Michael?

355
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,760
I did what I had to.

356
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,430
Sometimes sacrifices
have to be made for the greater good.

357
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,600
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown and all that.

00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,483
Well, hello, Chloe.

361
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,611
You do know bullets can't hurt me, right?

362
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,655
Wasn't supposed to hurt you.

363
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,407
[wings flap]

364
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,576
- It was supposed to distract you.

[exhales]

366
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,088
[Linda] Okay. All right. Watch this.

367
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,799
Ready?

368
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,426
Okay.

He falls all the time, Amenadiel.

373
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,023
Twice as much as
the other kids in the baby group.

374
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,400
Okay. Okay, so,

375
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,737
this occupational therapist/mom/influencer
that I follow on Instagram

376
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,697
who sponsors a blog, says that we...

377
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,242
- Maybe what we should do, Linda,
- [gasps]

378
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,120
is just let Charlie
figure it out for himself. Yeah?

379
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,706
You mean,
we should just let him hurt himself?

380
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,292
I don't think I can do that.

381
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,294
How could... How could you do that?

382
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,464
[chuckles] We're not signing him up
for cage fighting, Linda.

383
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,926
Falling is how humans learn.
It's how I learned.

384
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,930
Look, I... I lost my wings, my powers.

385
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,599
I fell again and again.

386
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,768
You know?

387
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,061
And getting back up...

388
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,022
[sighs]

389
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,068
...well, that was the most
empowering experience of my life.

390
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,030
Yeah. I'll make a chart.

391
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:14,286
I'm gonna log every time you fall,
Charlie, and see if there's a pattern.

392
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,039
Then I can slide into the mom-fluencer's
DMs and see if she has any ideas.

393
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,501
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Yeah. [chuckles] Hello.

394
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,962
[chuckles]

395
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,926
What?

396
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,178
No.

398
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,268

00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,751
[Lucifer sighs]

401
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,128
I can't believe Remi is gone.

402
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,296
She...

403
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,718
She died like she would have wanted.
She died a warrior.

404
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,554
It doesn't matter how she died.
She's still dead!

405
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,098
Dad and his mysterious ways.

406
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,267
If he'd just chosen a successor,
we wouldn't be here.

407
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,853
Remiel would still be alive,
Dan wouldn't be in Hell.

408
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:26,358
Father didn't give us the answers, Lucy,
because he wanted us to find our own way.

409
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,069
- Oh, even if it means dying?
- Yes!

410
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,863
Yes, Lucy.

411
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,992
You have to risk falling if you wanna fly.

412
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,079
Dad had faith in us.

413
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,415
- That's why he gave us choice.
- [Lucifer] Well, he shouldn't have.

414
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,711
I had the choice to save everything
and everyone I care about, but I didn't.

415
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,963
I chose wrong.

416
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,923
Michael is going to be God

417
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,801
because I didn't have the balls
to kill a two-bit fence

418
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,554
who wound up dying anyway.

419
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,516
And now, who knows how many other people
are gonna die because of my...

420
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,102
cowardice?

421
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,188
It's not cowardly to save a life.

422
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,651
It's not cowardly
to fight for a single soul.

423
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,737
We owe it to Remiel. We owe it to Dan.

424
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,365
We are the ones still standing.

425
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,577
We are the ones that have to fight.

427
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,332

I'm just not sure I know how to use this.

433
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,476
It's okay. I figured a way around that.

00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,812
You're not fighting!

435
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,149
Dan died because of me, Lucifer.

436
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,232
I am fighting.

00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,735
You are not fight...

438
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,818
I am fighting!

439
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,741
Fine.

440
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,954
Fine. Well, even if we had
a dozen demon blades,

441
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,499
it's still the four of us
against a literal army of angels.

442
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,919
I think I might have an idea
how we can get our own army.

443
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,049
You don't mean...

444
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,469
They're the best chance we've got.
What do you think, Maze?

445
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,262
[Mazikeen] Hey, I'm all in.

446
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,222
Let's kill a bunch of angels.

447
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,766
[Amenadiel] No, Mazikeen!

448
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,394
Now, if we're gonna do this,
there will be no killing.

another hand behind our backs?

452
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,235
It's not cowardly...

But I also know you don't want him either.

Everyone knows
what Michael's all about. Fear.

I'm gonna try
and convince you with the truth.

Lucifer wants the throne.

00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,138
Why am I not burning to a crisp?

701
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,601
[exhales] I should be ashes by now.

702
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,523
I'll be damned. The ring.

703
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,485
Lilith's immortality has protected me.

704
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,279
[shudders]

705
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,240
Though not for long, it seems.

706
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,826
Okay, I don't know
what the fork any of that means,

707
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,203
but you look like you could use a hand.

[Lucifer coughs]

711
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,422
The last time I saw you,
you were... you were in Hell.

712
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,674
Did I fly in the wrong bloody direction?

713
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,384
Nope, you're in the right place.

714
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,721
This is Heaven.
Or at least, one of its many rooms.

715
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,973
I'm still trying to get
the lay of the land.

716
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,643
I hear they have a room
made entirely out of cotton candy.

717
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,311
No, no, no, that's impossible.

718
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:12,399
No soul has ever
made it up here from there.

719
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,570
I don't know about that,
but I know I took your advice.

720
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,490
I faced my family. My guilt.

721
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,910
You went through the door.

722
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,662
Yep, finally.

723
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,830
And boom, Heaven!

724
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,250
- [both laugh]
- Heaven.

725
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,503

727
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:39,218
Hey, don't worry, she's here. Come on.

728
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,261
What... what are you doing?

729
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,889
- Hey, you helped me.
- [gulps]

730
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,015
Let me help you.

731
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:47,976
There we go.

732
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,522
- Wait, come on, Dad! Come on. Tell me!
- [laughing]

733
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,650
I'm serious.
Your mother's face was completely purple.

734
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,403
She forgot she had
the Althea makeup on.

735
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,072
And no one in the PTA
was brave enough to tell her...

736
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,324
[Lucifer] Detective! Detective!

737
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,451
Thank you. Thank you.

Lucifer.

742
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,297
What are you doing here?

743
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,383
[panting] I've come to get you.

744
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,886
It's not your time. You need to come back.

745
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,683
Oh, that's right. The...

746
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,895
- The... the war, and...
- Yes.

747
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,689
...and I left Trixie...

748
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,442
- and my friends and...
- Yeah.

749
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,277
...I left you.

750
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,778
- Yes.
- But... but...

751
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,825
my Dad's here,
and I can't... I can't lose him again.

752
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,871
It's okay. I'm not going anywhere.

753
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,375
But it sounds like some people
could use your help, Detective Decker.

754
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,463
- Thanks, Dad.
- [breathing shakily]

755
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,717
- Okay. Wait! How do we get back?
- [gasps]

756
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,970
[Lucifer] I'm not sure <i>we </i>can.

757
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,766
I'm afraid there's
not enough power left for the both of us.

758
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,351
No, I'm not going without you.
What are you talking about?

759
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,644
[Lucifer] You have to.

760
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,939
You have to.

761
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,735
The world still needs you, Chloe Decker.

762
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,321
- No, you don't have to do that!
