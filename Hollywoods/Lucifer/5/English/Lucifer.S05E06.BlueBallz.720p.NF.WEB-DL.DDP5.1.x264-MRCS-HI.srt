1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,513
[woman and man moaning intimately]

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,684
[both kissing, groaning]

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,441
[groaning intensifies]

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,154
[bumping sound]

5
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,405
Did you hear something?

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,073
It's just the ocean.

7
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,918
[kissing]

8
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,256
- [gun squirts]
- [woman screams]

9
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,008
- [man laughs]
- You gonna bone all night?

10
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,384
[woman laughs]

11
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,011
Come back to the show, you sex fiends.

12
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,067
- [man] All right, let's go.
- [woman] Whoo!

13
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,142
Come on!

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,063
[hip hop music playing]

15
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,898
[crowd cheering]

16
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,997
[music intensifies]

17
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,107
- [electricity sizzles]
- [grunting]

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,627
[pained stammering]

19
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,547
[groans]

20
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,966
- [crowd cheers]
- [music continues]

21
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,060
[music ends]

22
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,022
- [police siren wails]
- [cameras clicking]

23
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,985
[helicopter whirring]

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,454
[Lucifer chuckles lightly]

25
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,624
[Lucifer] Excuse us.

26
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,377
[Chloe] Thank you.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,170
Whoa, you guys got here fast.

28
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,547
Wait.

29
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,217
Did you guys come together?

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,927
- Uh, no.
- Uh...

31
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,513
Totally unrelated,
can I talk to you for a second?

32
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,098
- Just... Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

33
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,765
[Chloe] Okay.

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,353
Um, so... Yeah, we did.

35
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,439
Oh, my God, I... I didn't know
you two were a thing.

36
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,024
I mean, I mean, I'd hoped, but...

37
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,318
You two bow-chicka-wow-wow?

38
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,028
No, no. We just kissed.

39
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,613
- Mm-hmm.
- And then guess what?

40
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,448
You called, so here we are.

41
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,325
Decker, do you always answer your phone?

42
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,244
I just don't want my...

43
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,789
sex life discussed
in the workplace, okay? So...

44
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,207
[imitates zipper closing sound]

45
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,667
Here we go.

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,211
- Okay, Ella, so what do we have?
- [Lucifer] Mm.

47
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,129
Blue Ballz.

48
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,213
You, too?

49
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,383
No. Blue <i>Ballz,</i> with a "Z."

50
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,803
Fancy DJ headphones.

51
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,513
Also, our murder weapon.

52
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,141
Electrocuted poor DJ Matt Pexxa.

53
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,476
How does one get electrocuted
with headphones?

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,271
Oh, well, you see, um,
this tiny little silver wire

55
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,674
- coming out of the padding?
- Mm.

56
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,067
So, the current travels through the wire
and into his skin.

57
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:18,072
Now, you add sea air and his sweat,
perfect combo for maximum voltage.

58
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,533
Oh! That'd be a sick DJ name.

59
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,202
All DJs are sick, if you ask me.

60
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,285
[both chuckle]

61
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,580
[Chloe sighs deeply]

62
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,497
So, any leads?

63
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,250
Well, we're not even sure
it's a murder yet.

64
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,003
I mean, it could just be
a wardrobe malfunction.

65
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,588
Wonderful. Can we go home, then?

66
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,549
You know what? Uh, hold that thought.

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
Okay, Pioneer.

68
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,310
Best mixers on the market, and...

69
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,895
Oh, here. The, uh...

70
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,440
surge protector, it's disconnected.

71
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,525
Surge protector, I see.

72
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,944
[both chuckle]

73
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,072
And, um, let's see here.
Well, looks intentional. It's a clean cut.

74
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,450
Someone sabotaged Pexxa's setup
before he went on stage,

75
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,286
and so that, with the live wire
in the headphones,

76
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,746
I mean, it's most likely murder.

77
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,589
Well, surely someone
must have seen something

78
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,376
before our charred DJ went to his demise.

79
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,544
Let's just question the witnesses,
and case closed.

80
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,799
Then we can all go back
to our previous engagements.

81
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:22,470
Well, um, we do have about
500 potential witnesses

82
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,225
that are all drunk,
and most likely very high.

83
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,810
So...

84
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,520
we're gonna be here a while.

85
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,774
See you out there.

86
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,653
- [sighs]
- [Charlie cries]

87
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,783
Why is he still crying?

88
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,453
The doctor said he's fine.
It's just a phase.

89
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,455
[crying intensifies]

90
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,665
You missed our coffee date.

91
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,792
Oh, my gosh, Maze. Is it morning?

92
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,626
I'm so sorry.

93
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,129
We've been up all night.

94
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,715
You're welcome to stay,
but it's kind of loud.

95
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,050
Pain and suffering. [chuckles]

96
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,385
Music to my ears.

97
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,220
Okay, okay, okay.

98
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,347
Okay. [sighs]

99
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,184
You have my undivided attention.

100
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,268
Is that a latte?

101
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,147
Okay. So...

102
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,230
Mm!

103
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,067
Okay, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,278
You must be going through a lot
with your mom.

105
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,361
No.

106
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,324
So she died in a shitty apartment
all by herself.

107
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:25,950
Sucks for her.

108
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,161
All I need to be is to <i>not </i>be her.

109
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,996
[Charlie exclaims]

110
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,622
So how do I do that?

111
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,416
Use the blue pacifier!

112
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,500
[Amenadiel] I am!

113
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,713
- I'm sorry, Maze, what's the question?
- How do I not end up alone?

114
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,258
That is not an easy question to answer.

115
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
- [Charlie whines]
- Try swaddling him!

116
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,512
[Amenadiel] Oh, what a wonderful idea!

117
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,725
You just have to find someone
to connect with.

118
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,269
I just scare everybody away.

119
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
Well, I'm still here, right?

120
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,608
So you just know that
when you find someone

121
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,735
that you're romantically interested in,

122
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,612
you just try not to be so scary.

123
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,907
You know, be more open,
emotionally available.

124
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,283
"Emotionally available."

125
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,534
- [Charlie whines]
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,578
Yeah, okay, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

127
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,872
Huh.

128
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,833
[helicopter whirring]

129
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,462
- Oh! Jesus.
- Wait, I got you, don't... Sorry.

130
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,090
- Thanks. Old butterfingers, over here.
- Yeah.

131
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,299
Ah, don't worry.

132
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,718
- I drop stuff all the time.
- [chuckles]

133
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,347
Oh, is that a 200-millimeter macro lens?

134
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,348
It sure is.

135
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,016
I picked up this bad boy last week.

136
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,061
That's some professional-level equipment.

137
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,814
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, wait, you're...

138
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,273
You're LAPD, aren't you?

139
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,110
Yep, best job in the world.

140
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,363
You wouldn't be able
to give me anything over there?

141
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,468
- You mean, like inside scoop?
- Yeah.

142
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,533
Look, it's just...

143
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:53,621
This is my first real piece and I'm having
trouble finding any leads at all.

144
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,378
Look, I'm not allowed to give you
any real details, okay, but...

145
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,881
maybe if you use my name,
the media relations guy can help you out.

146
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,009
Thank you. Thank you.
So, what... what is your name?

147
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,469
- Uh, Ella...
- Uh-huh.

148
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,887
Lopez.

149
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,473
Got it. Hi, Ella.

150
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,058
- I'm Pete.
- Okay.

151
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,309
Um, you know, like...

152
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,562
Maybe as, like, a real thank-you,

153
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,649
I could take you out
for a drink or coffee or...

154
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,359
Uh...

155
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,864
I'm not really dating right now.

156
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,116
- Cool. All right, yeah.
- Okay.

157
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,701
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you.

158
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,620
Thank you very much, Ella Lopez.

159
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,704
Yeah.

160
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,751
Someone's got the hots for our Miss Lopez.

161
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,253
Mm. Not my type.

162
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,755
No? Seems just like you,
perfectly adorable.

163
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,839
Exactly.

164
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,550
Not all of us can be

165
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,011
- in the perfect relationship.
- [chuckles]

166
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,388
- [gasps deeply]
- Yes, it is rather exciting, isn't it?

167
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,348
No, that's DJ Karnal!

168
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,726
I-I mean, I didn't know
he was headlining the show.

169
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,395
It must've been a surprise appearance.
That's so cool.

170
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,231
Yes, I must admit, he may be the one DJ

171
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,816
who has even a modicum of talent.

172
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,235
But then again,
his ludicrous name negates that.

173
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,654
[ironic chuckle] I mean, "Karnal"? Really?

174
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,324
- Must everything be about sex?
- [man] Chloe!

175
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,743
- Oh, hey, Jed!
- What, it's been like...

176
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,869
Hi!

177
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,037
...a minute!

178
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,830
Uh...

179
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,501
- [people chattering]
- [seagulls squawking]

180
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,959
It's so good to see you...

181
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,796
[blows party horn loudly]

182
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,882
These are fun, aren't they?

183
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,217
Oh, hi.

184
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,427
- Uh, Jed, meet Lucifer.
- "Jed"?

185
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,513
[chuckles] Yeah, it's my real name.

186
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,972
- What's yours?
- [scoffs]

187
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,516
Uh, Lucifer is his real name.

188
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,184
- [Chloe] Yeah.
- Oh.

189
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,894
So what are you doing here?

190
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,187
Well, this is a show.

191
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,188
I'm a DJ.

192
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,189
Right.

193
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,482
What are you doing here?

194
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,944
Well, this is a crime scene,
and I'm a detective.

195
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,820
- So you did it.
- Yeah.

196
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,304
I always knew you'd be a great cop.

197
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,032
How do you two know each other?

198
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,410
Oh, um, Jed and I dated.

199
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,912
Right.

200
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,331
Uh, casually. Yeah.

201
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,167
Long, long time ago. [clears throat]

202
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,669
Come on, Cherry Jane.

203
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,796
It wasn't that casual.

204
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,257
Um... Lucifer is my partner.

205
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,550
Yes, partner.

206
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,313
So are you still married to that guy Dave?

207
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,385
"Dan."

208
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,887
We're divorced.

209
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,891
Well, I never thought
he was good enough for you.

210
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,974
Only one man is.

211
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,475
So are you in a relationship?

212
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,478
Um...

213
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,104
Relationship?

214
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,189
Um...

215
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,066
No.

216
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,946
N... Not in a... a relationship, uh, per se.

217
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,699
Well, it was really good seeing you again.

218
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,782
You, too.

219
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,244
Detective, we need you over here.

220
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,787
Okay. Excuse me.

221
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,706
[scoffs]

222
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,919
- So...
- [phone rings]

223
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,005
Oh, I gotta take this.

224
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,090
Bollocks.

225
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,467
[sighs]

226
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,274
[Chloe sighs]

227
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,030
You know, our first kiss was by the water.

228
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,113
You remember that?

229
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,115
Yes.

230
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,331
You know, about what I said earlier,
Lucifer...

231
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,500
Listen, I have dated guys at work before,

232
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,755
but, you know, people talk,
and I don't want that.

233
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,423
And...

234
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,506
this...

235
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,093
"us," you know, we...

236
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,056
We don't even know what this is yet.

237
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,057
Do we?

238
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,727
I suppose not.

239
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,814
Sorry, that was my manager.
Had to tell him I wasn't dead.

240
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,358
What do you mean?

241
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,193
Well, I was supposed to go on after Pexxa.

242
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,528
It's scary seeing another DJ die.

243
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,197
Makes you realize...

244
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,698
life's short.

245
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,075
Some not short enough.

246
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,371
Uh, do you know of anyone
who would want to kill Pexxa?

247
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,705
A... A crew member, maybe?

248
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,207
You think this was intentional?

249
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,668
Yes, we think that Pexxa was killed
with his headphones.

250
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,754
Pexxa's headphones?
He borrowed those from me...

251
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,133
this morning, right before the show.

252
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,217
He did?

253
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,137
Okay, were the headphones out of
your possession before the show?

254
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,789
No, I handed them straight to him.

255
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,684
What about your mixing board?
Um, Pexxa's surge protector was cut off.

256
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,102
No, we all use the same setup.

257
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,437
Are you saying
someone's trying to kill me?

258
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,816
Might I point out that
if no one else had the headphones,

259
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,068
how do we know you didn't kill
our poor disc jockey?

260
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,695
Right, um...

261
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,614
I mean, you do have an alibi
for before the show, yeah?

262
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,574
Sure, I was with my producer
the whole time.

263
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,701
Just... Just ask him.

264
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,702
Oh, we will.

265
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,546
Well, if you were the intended target,
you know, you're not safe here,

266
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,699
so best if you come with us.

267
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,207
- [Lucifer sighs]
- Come on.

268
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,710
Ladies first.

269
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,840
[Dan] God, I hate that guy.

270
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,926
They broke up right before I met Chloe.

271
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,863
But I always kind of felt like
I was living in his shadow, you know?

272
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,348
I don't know if it's the whole
"first love" thing or what.

273
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:09,311
I swear, there's a part of Chloe that will
never get over his stupid chiseled face.

274
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,480
Sorry, man.

275
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,733
There's no need to apologize.

276
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,443
The detective had a child with you,

277
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,653
and I've never felt
the slightest bit threatened.

278
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,698
You're right. He does have a stupid face.

279
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,781
Mm-hmm.

280
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,330
You know he tried to get back together
with Chloe when we first split up?

281
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,248
Look, I'm just saying,
watch out for that guy, all right?

282
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,916
I wouldn't put anything past him.

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,752
Okay, so we got a lead.

284
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,465
Jed's been receiving threatening emails
from a man named Raul Blanco.

285
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,176
Yeah, some ass-hat who's pissed
about my foundation

286
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,052
building low-income housing at the marina.

287
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,471
Of course he has a foundation.

288
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,181
Uh, Detective...

289
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,559
I've been thinking,
perhaps we dismissed DJ Dum-Dum

290
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,352
a little bit too quickly as the killer.

291
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,563
Lucifer, he has an alibi,

292
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,441
no motive, and trust me, I know him.

293
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,693
- Okay.
- All right.

294
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,905
All right, Lucifer and I
will go question Blanco,

295
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,700
and, well, you just stay here
at the precinct where it's safe.

296
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,118
Thanks, Cherry Jane.

297
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,496
What would I do without you?

298
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,580
[chuckles]

299
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,125
- Hmm.
- Okay. [Chloe clears throat]

300
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,551
Bring it in.

301
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,848
Hey, Ellen!

302
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,768
Oh, hi, Maze.

303
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,728
You, uh...

304
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,606
You hittin' that?

305
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,689
Brimley?

306
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,275
No way, Jose!

307
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,528
He's happily married with five kids.

308
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,447
[sighs deeply]

309
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,491
How do you do that, Ellen?

310
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,076
How are you so...

311
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,744
friendly?

312
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,040
I don't know.
I guess I'm just me, you know?

313
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,751
Ella.

314
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,085
Huh.

315
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,046
But I got to run to the lab.

316
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,130
Bye, Maze.

317
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,427
[hip-hop music plays]

318
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,597
So, "Cherry Jane"?

319
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,974
Nickname from high school?

320
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,101
Embarrassing thing
your parents used to call you?

321
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,185
No, just Jed.

322
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,020
We went on a road trip once

323
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,941
and we came across this, um,
cherry stand, and, um...

324
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,818
Well, yeah. Never mind.

325
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,195
So Jed was your first love, then?

326
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,573
Oh, I see you've been talking to Dan.
[sighs]

327
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,159
Well, we were just kids,
and it was great, for a moment,

328
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,244
but it's in the past.

329
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,830
I'm over him, and... he's over me.

330
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,913
[indistinct chanting]

331
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,791
Yes, he's completely over you.

332
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,418
Put Karnal to bed!

333
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,253
Cherry Jane is the pits!

334
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,213
That's the guy who's been threatening Jed.

335
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,258
Cherry Jane is the pits!
Put Karnal to bed!

336
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,634
Raul Blanco?

337
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,916
If you're here to protest,
there's more signs around back.

338
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,639
No, we're here to ask you about Jed,

339
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,599
Karnal,

340
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,102
and the lengths you're willing to go to
to stop this community outreach program.

341
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,939
Look, I'm all for helping the homeless,
but I bring my kids here.

342
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,423
The last thing this community needs

343
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,443
is drug addicts and mental cases
roaming around.

344
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,004
- [crowd] Yeah!
- Yes, there you were,

345
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,446
minding your own business,

346
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,199
when some musical interloper comes
into your life under false pretenses,

347
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,952
getting his grubby little DJ hands
all over it.

348
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,288
Exactly. And all these people
feel the same way.

349
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,040
- [crowd] Yeah!
- Really?

350
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,499
May I? Thank you.

351
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,503
Do any of you know what zip code we're in?

352
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,213
Hmm.

353
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,135
And how about how much
Mr. Blanco paid you all to be here?

354
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,429
[crowd] What? No.
What's she talking about?

355
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,847
[Blanco clears throat]

356
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,140
I looked into you, Mr. Blanco.

357
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,184
Your youngest kid is 23 years old,

358
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,227
and the only thing
you're worried about protecting

359
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,355
is the reputation of your yacht club
down the way.

360
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,583
- Well, I...
- I know you sent threatening emails to Jed

361
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,568
right before you tried to electrocute him
on stage last night.

362
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,944
Last night?

363
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,071
I was here, protesting.

364
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,530
I'd never hurt anyone.

365
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,449
I just need Jed to move the shelter.

366
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,117
You know he works here, right?

367
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,371
The guy should be thanking me
for protecting this neighborhood.

368
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,792
Just last weekend, I caught
a homeless woman breaking into his place.

369
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,543
Chased her out of that gate.

370
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,341
Okay, so Jed said the last time he saw
his headphones was last weekend.

371
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,426
Well, why would a homeless woman
want to kill Jed?

372
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,220
Maybe she wasn't homeless?

373
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,347
Maybe she broke in
to tamper with the headphones?

374
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,766
She could be the one
who wanted to murder Jed.

375
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,893
Assuming anyone wanted to murder Jed.

376
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,479
[crowd screams]

377
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,232
[crowd exclaiming]

378
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,068
[Lucifer panting] Are you okay?

379
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,151
Yeah.

380
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,280
[Blanco] Is everyone okay?

381
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,615
We need to stay back.

382
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,992
Well...

383
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,370
isn't this convenient for Jed?

384
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,162
[scoffs]

385
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,457
His place blowing up? How?

386
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,644
Well, first someone tries
to electrocute him on stage,

387
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,253
yet "accidentally" kills someone else.

388
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,839
Now someone tries to blow him up,
yet fails again?

389
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,508
Either Jed is the luckiest target alive,

390
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,760
or he's behind all this.

391
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,444
Jed would be here right now
if we hadn't kept him at the precinct.

392
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,408
- Yet he isn't.
- He could have been blown to bits.

393
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,672
- Yet he wasn't.
- Why do you think he's behind all this?

394
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,854
Well, clearly he's orchestrating all this
to get close to you again.

395
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,189
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

396
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,774
Electrocuting a colleague?

397
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,693
Blowing up his own studio?

398
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,237
No one would go that far
just to be near me.

399
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,282
Well, I did go to Hell and back for you,
twice, but who's counting?

400
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,784
[police sirens approaching]

401
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,537
Lucifer, are you jealous?

402
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,664
[chuckles] Jealous?

403
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,752
Of a man-boy who scratches records
for a living? Now who's being absurd?

404
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,298
I'm simply saying how convenient it is
for DJ Dingus

405
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,776
that any and all evidence
that could have been in that studio

406
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,302
is now completely destroyed.

407
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,096
- Wait, maybe not all of it.
- Hmm?

408
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,098
Blanco, he said that
the woman who broke in,

409
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,725
she escaped through that gate.

410
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,313
Maybe we can pull some prints.

411
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,357
Over, over,

412
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,069
and tuck, right?

413
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,736
Yeah.

414
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,406
- Yeah, but...
- Looks right to me.

415
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,784
...every time, his arms just
keep popping out everywhere.

416
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,663
At first I thought it was because
he had some sort of super strength, but...

417
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,167
then he couldn't even hold up his rattle,
so I don't know, maybe not.

418
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,045
The crazy things
we think our kids can do, huh?

419
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,128
[Amenadiel chuckles]

420
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,505
I just...

421
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,467
can't seem to do anything right.

422
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,967
Come on.

423
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,845
Don't be so hard on yourself.

424
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,931
Look, what I'm saying is,

425
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,724
everybody gets it wrong.

426
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,808
Not Linda.

427
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,104
Linda always knows what to do,
and I'm always in the way.

428
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,648
Ah, I'm sure Linda feels just as clueless
as you do.

429
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,733
What's important is that you care,

430
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,652
and you're trying your best.

431
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,319
[sighs]

432
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,446
I suppose so.

433
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,701
Still, it would be nice if I could get
Charlie to stop crying just once.

434
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,785
[Dan laughs]

435
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,996
Well, I have faith in you, pal.

436
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,292
Thanks for being such a great friend, Dan,

437
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,169
and for taking the day off to help.

438
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,711
Well...

439
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,923
wasn't entirely selfless.

440
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,676
I couldn't stand another minute
around Chloe's ex.

441
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,845
The guy's perfect.

442
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,389
He makes me feel
so bad about myself, you know?

443
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,184
And I kind of already do that enough
on my own.

444
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,894
What are you talking about?

445
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,438
- You're a great guy.
- [scoffs]

446
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,522
Hey.

447
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,317
Great cop, great dad.

448
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,571
And your hair, it's so high.

449
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,656
[laughs]

450
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,408
Thanks, man.

451
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,872
There are things you don't know about me.

452
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,331
Things I've done.

453
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,878
And no matter how hard I try...

454
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,633
I just don't think
I'll ever make up for them.

455
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,762
Listen to me, Daniel.

456
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,765
We all have our demons.

457
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,225
Myself included.

458
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,021
But believe me when I say this...

459
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,356
I know evil.

460
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,902
And you, my friend, are not it.

461
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,157
[Chloe] Okay, so we're looking for
Belinda Roberts.

462
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,492
Ella pulled her prints off of Jed's gate.

463
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,079
A park ranger said her car's been here
over a day, so she's probably hiding out.

464
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,374
Great. Let's just find her so we can
finally be done with this case.

465
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,294
So you're finally over the idea
that Jed's behind all this?

466
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,298
Of course not. Once we find
this Belinda woman, Jed's co-conspirator,

467
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,718
we'll get her to prove he's involved, and
then we can all go back to life pre-Jed.

468
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,802
Oh.

469
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:25,432
Well, I was hoping we could, um, solve
this case, uh, before the sun goes down.

470
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,100
Like I said, sooner rather than later.

471
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,518
[woman] Stop!

472
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,440
One more step and you'll die.

473
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,524
- Detective!
- Oh!

474
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,735
Careful. I know how to handle snakes.

475
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,362
- [Chloe panting]
- There...

476
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,863
Careful.

477
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,659
- [Chloe] Is it...
- [woman] No!

478
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:49,498
Do you know how long
I have been waiting for copulation?

479
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,791
You and me both.

480
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,501
Clearly you're not aware

481
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,338
of how rare sound recordings
of rattlesnake sex are.

482
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,090
Well, it's not my strong suit, no.

483
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,593
Their foreplay is incredibly intense.

484
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,762
And if things go well,

485
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,306
their sex can last for days.

486
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,266
Huh.

487
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,642
But you ruined it.

488
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,812
Listen, we're here to ask about Jed Moore.

489
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,229
Karnal.

490
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,148
We know you broke into his studio.

491
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,942
I don't have anything to say about that.

492
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,194
[groans] Listen to me, Miss Snake Pervert.

493
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,531
What did you desire from Jed?

494
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,618
I want him to pay.

495
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,329
Pay you for helping him
fake his murder attempts?

496
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,913
Wait.

497
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,541
Murder? No!

498
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,210
He owes me for sampling
my sound recordings.

499
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,337
His song, "Otter Vox,"

500
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,842
relies heavily on my otter sex recordings,
and I have not been compensated.

501
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,427
Well, that sounds like motive.

502
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,178
What were you doing in his studio?

503
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,433
I was planting recording devices.

504
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,478
I was trying to record proof
that Karnal stole my tracks.

505
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,940
Well, that is where we'll find proof
that Jed is behind all of this.

506
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,609
- Or of who the real killer is.
- Mm.

507
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,450
Hey.

508
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,870
Hey. Good news.

509
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,747
We found a woman
who broke into your studio

510
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,124
and planted some secret
recording devices last week.

511
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,625
That's good news?

512
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,128
Well, we're hoping that
it will identify the killer.

513
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,463
Whomever <i>he</i> may be.

514
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,672
Hmm.

515
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,841
Hey, what's with all the gift baskets?

516
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,343
Oh. They're from my fans.

517
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,094
They found out my place blew up,

518
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,805
and they've been sending me stuff
from all around the world.

519
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,557
It's crazy how devoted they are.

520
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,392
Devoted to you? Yes, that is crazy.

521
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,893
Crazy.

522
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,272
Wait, do you think one of your fans
could be behind all this?

523
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,815
Oh, I doubt it. They're harmless.

524
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,443
Though I have heard of
a few really obsessed ones

525
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,736
chatting on a message board,

526
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,154
but I've never had a problem.

527
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,238
That you know of.

528
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,824
I'm gonna look into it. You stay put.

529
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:52,496
Speaking of,
I am getting a little stir-crazy here.

530
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,955
Oh.

531
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,001
Well, I mean, you still have to be safe.

532
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,211
You could stay...

533
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,129
Cherry, are you inviting me to stay at...

534
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,631
My place. Yes.

535
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,508
Yes, that's exactly
what she's suggesting.

536
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,191
- Excellent idea, Detective.
- [chuckles]

537
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,719
It's like you're reading my mind.

538
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,887
- [Chloe] Hmm.
- [Jed] Huh.

539
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,262
Great.

540
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,058
Shall we?

541
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,141
Sure.

542
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,271
Nice digs.

543
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,566
Mm. Appears we have similar tastes.

544
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,693
Yeah, I still can't believe
I have to be here.

545
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,029
I mean, this whole thing is just...

546
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,281
[sighs] It's crazy.

547
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:33,662
Almost as crazy as if it had been
concocted by a madman to, say,

548
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,122
lure back an old flame.

549
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,041
Which is also pointless,
because the detective is spoken for.

550
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,252
Wait, are you talking about Chloe?

551
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,462
- Mm-hmm.
- She said she wasn't in a relationship.

552
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,546
Well, she is.

553
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,007
Oh. [chuckles]

554
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,174
I get it.

555
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,428
You're interested in her.

556
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,721
I'm not <i>interested </i>in her.

557
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,057
The detective and I are seeing each other,

558
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,561
which is why your little ruse
is not going to work.

559
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,979
Listen.

560
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,565
Chloe's amazing.

561
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,984
I don't think I ever really got over her.

562
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,194
I named my foundation after her,
for God's sakes.

563
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,278
I know.

564
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,613
But you do start to wonder.

565
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,158
I mean...

566
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,786
could she really be
as amazing as I remember?

567
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,874
Then when I saw her this morning...

568
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,168
Oh, man.

569
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,670
My memory didn't even do her justice.

570
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,923
All those feelings came flooding back,
and I started to wonder...

571
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,801
You know, maybe this is fate.

572
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,596
But if you think I would kill Pexxa

573
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,519
and blow up my own studio
just to get her back,

574
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,934
dude, you are even crazier about her
than I ever was.

575
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,102
[chuckles]

576
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,897
What are you doing?

577
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,399
Just making sure. Tell me...

578
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,903
What is it you truly desire?

579
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,405
I...

580
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,532
I wish I hadn't screwed things up
with Chloe.

581
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,452
Ah-ha! I knew it! Admitting to motive.

582
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,538
No. I mean, yeah, I wish Chloe
hadn't dumped me, but I just...

583
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,622
Wait.

584
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,123
She dumped you?

585
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,583
Yeah.

586
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,546
Everything was fine, and then
all of a sudden she just called it off.

587
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:11,468
So she just changed
how she felt about you without...

588
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,637
without any warning?

589
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,221
Yeah.

590
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,722
Pretty much.

591
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,809
- It sucked.
- Right, then, Jed.

592
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,814
I am going to need to know
exactly what you did wrong

593
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,651
so I can steer clear
of your every mistake.

594
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,361
Now...

595
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,072
start talking.

596
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,241
[sounds of birds, automobiles
playing on speakers]

597
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,469
I mean, even though we're just looking
at last weekend,

598
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,371
when Jed left the headphones unattended,
still...

599
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,748
Oy, so many sounds.

600
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,751
I mean, you'd think
a DJ would want a quieter studio.

601
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,711
Anything on your end?

602
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,549
Listen to this. So, Karnalgirl506.

603
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,010
"I left my whole world behind
for you, Jed,

604
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,845
and now so will you.

605
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,266
I missed you at the show,
I missed you at your studio,

606
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,102
but you won't get away next time."

607
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,478
Wow, sounds ominous.

608
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,562
Yeah.

609
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,649
That sounds like motive and opportunity.

610
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,403
This Karnalgirl506 could be our killer.
Definitely female.

611
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,573
Maybe a jilted sexual partner?

612
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,949
Great. Now you can go.

613
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,076
I can finish up this audio scrubbing
on my own.

614
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,494
What do you mean, "go"? Go where?

615
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,079
To Lucifer's.

616
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,623
I thought you guys were gonna finally,
you know,

617
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,209
hang out tonight. Mm.

618
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,338
Yeah, well, it... [clears throat]

619
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,756
...got postponed.

620
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,175
Oh, you're nervous that
you won't measure up in bed.

621
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,469
I mean, he is pretty experienced.

622
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,722
I mean, I'd put it, like,
in the thousands, probably.

623
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,558
But you know what, you got this.
You totally got this. You're sexy.

624
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,227
That actually hadn't crossed my mind.

625
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,855
Oh, you're waiting on an STD check!
Super smart.

626
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,398
No, I... It just...

627
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,483
Listen, Ella, he canceled.

628
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,487
I guess he'd rather spend time with my ex
than hang out with me, okay?

629
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,699
Yeah, that's worse. Like, way...

630
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,034
- Shh!
- I mean...

631
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,620
Listen.

632
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,330
[rustling, beeping]

633
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,456
Do you hear that?

634
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,208
Sounds like someone's inside.

635
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,629
Wait, I've heard that sound before. BRB.

636
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,671
Be right back.

637
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,968
[Jed] <i>See, Chloe loves a mystery.</i>

638
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,805
We started out as friends,
both aspiring artists.

639
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,682
We even worked together.

640
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,852
I always wanted to be with her.

641
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,396
Possibly relatable. Continue.

642
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,149
In hindsight... [sighs]

643
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,778
that's when the relationship
was at its best.

644
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,279
Better without sex?

645
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,198
[scoffs] Not relatable.

646
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,618
Seriously, all that
unresolved sexual tension,

647
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,995
the "Will they, won't they?"
It kept her hooked.

648
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,331
Then we became a couple and...

649
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,084
just lost interest.

650
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,167
Oh...

651
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,671
- Lacking in the bedroom department, I see.
- [laughs]

652
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,382
Well... [chuckles]
...that won't be a problem.

653
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,800
No, man, the sex was great.

654
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,511
- I mean, like, really great.
- Mm.

655
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,721
- Amazing, actually. The stuff she can do...
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,098
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got it.

657
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,892
But, just... It wasn't enough.

658
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,354
It was the lack of mystery that did us in.

659
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,523
And my mistake... [scoffs]

660
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,024
was wearing my heart on my sleeve.

661
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,318
Too much of an open book.

662
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,321
Really? 'Cause I've been in therapy,
so I'm, you know, bit of an expert,

663
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:23,410
but I believe that talking
about one's emotions is... good? No?

664
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:28,665
No, see, Chloe looks at everything
like a case that needs to be solved.

665
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,166
- Mm.
- What I didn't realize was

666
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,334
when she solved me...

667
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,876
figured me out...

668
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,629
she was done.

669
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,300
'Cause underneath the handsome,
the sexy, the fun...

670
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,384
Mm.

671
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,846
...it's just me.

672
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,057
So she moved onto the next mystery.

673
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,143
And you know, I don't blame her.

674
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,228
Should have played it closer to the vest,
but I...

675
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,439
I was just so naive, you know?

676
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,522
Huh.

677
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,984
[phone rings]

678
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,067
Oh!

679
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,612
Speak of the devil's girlfriend.

680
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,824
Um... [sighs]

681
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,368
How's that for mystery?

682
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,078
Hey, Lucifer. Uh, listen,

683
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,873
I'm just calling to make sure
everything is okay, and, um...

684
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,710
I-I need to talk to Jed about
any crazy fans that he knows of,

685
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,588
so just please call me when you get this.

686
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,257
Shoot.

687
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,136
Oh, that was fast, Ella.

688
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,598
You changed your pants, shirt, face.

689
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,433
- Oh.
- Hey, Maze.

690
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,352
Oh, my God, I have that exact same shirt!

691
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,146
Yes, you did! [chuckles]

692
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,148
Wait. Did you steal my clothes?

693
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,150
[Maze] Oh!

694
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,152
I'm confused.

695
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,278
[Maze sighs deeply]

696
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,239
I understand how you feel...

697
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,324
Ella.

698
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,286
- Oh! You got my name right!
- [Maze chuckles]

699
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,205
- Should I even ask?
- Oh, ask away.

700
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,208
I am completely open
and emotionally available now,

701
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,835
just like my good friend Ella.

702
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,920
Aww.

703
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,005
Okay, so you're acting like Ella, and...

704
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,216
You know what? Never mind.
Real Ella, what do we have?

705
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,301
Uh, that beeping sound, right,

706
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,637
threw me back to dinner
at my <i>abuelita's.</i>

707
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,431
I mean, the old lady is deaf as a squid.

708
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,392
From the phone to the doorbell,
to the smoke detector,

709
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,771
her place is full of noises
the woman can't hear.

710
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,023
<i>- Abuelita.
- Exactamente.</i>

711
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,733
Like this one time at my quinceañera,

712
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,097
- she didn't even know...
- Ella.

713
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,695
Right, right. So I did some digging,

714
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,616
and this beeping comes
from a hearing aid with low battery,

715
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,160
a digital ITE hearing aid, to be exact.

716
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,746
Just like the one my deaf <i>abuelita</i> wears.

717
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,499
- So the killer's an old lady?
- No, not necessarily.

718
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,376
Loud music can damage hearing.

719
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,045
So maybe Karnalgirl506
might wear a hearing aid.

720
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,587
Exactly.

721
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,881

Charlie's the same.

730
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,603
It's Linda that's the problem.

731
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,480
She just handed me the baby and left.

732
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,606
Well, what'd you do?

733
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,066
I just said what you said.

734
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,402
That it's okay that she gets it wrong
all the time,

735
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,446
and it's perfectly natural that she's
so clueless because no one ever...

736
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,447
Oh.

737
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,657
Okay.

738
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,535
Right, I... I see what happened there.

739
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,661
Mm-hmm.

740
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,580

Yes, yes, yes! Come, come, come.

745
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,064
I'm sorry.

00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,441
You know, I'm good.

Uh...

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,071
Linda, I'm not quite sure
why Maze called you,

749
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,240
but like I told you, this is a sting.

750
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,451
Oh! I thought you said vodka.

751
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,536

start with dancing, then more dancing,

Yeah!

757

Time out.

00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,721
Ladies, let me remind you
that there is a killer here.

759
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:15,433
As long as that killer doesn't cry,
spit up, or wet themselves,

760
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,810
I am in. All right, good,
I'm gonna find him.

761
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,812
All right, how do I help? How do I help?

762
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,648
All right, let's do this. Let's split up,

763
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,943
and remember, we're looking for
a girl with a hearing aid.

We're on it. We're so on it.

- Yeah!

Okay, not that I mind

Um...

00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:51,135
Well, we just had to do this sting at Lux
without him, you know?

00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,473
All right. Hearing aid. Let's go.

it must be different somehow, right?

I mean, it's totally normal.

882
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,950
I mean, well...
I mean, way, way above average.

883
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,202
I mean, it's perfect.

884
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,079
Seriously, sex with Lucifer
is the last thing

885
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,289
you should be worried about.

886
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:15,334
What you should be worried about is
that he's unfathomably narcissistic,

887
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,004
utterly terrified of intimacy,

888
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,756
and sabotages everything good
that ever happens to him.

889
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,802
So essentially, he's the oldest,
most immature person in the world.

890
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,637
Nay, "universe."

891
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,179
[phone chimes]

892
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,182
I... Oh, hold on.

893
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,601
Oh, it's Ella.

894
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:36,689
Okay, so Ella says they finished
checking their half of the bar.

895
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,316
No sign of a hearing aid.

896
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,775
Oh, shoot.

897
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,695
If our killer isn't here,
who knows where she is.

898
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,907
So I'm going to call Lucifer
and see if he still has eyes on Jed.

899
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,120
[phone rings]

900
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,330
[Charlie cries]

901
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,335
[chuckles]

902
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,011
Dude, did you just throw your phone
out the window?

903
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,055
- Mm-hmm.
- Jeez, you're such a weirdo.

904
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,017
Oh. It's Chloe.

905
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,352
- Really?
- Yeah.

906
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,144
Hey, what's up?

907
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,147
That sucks.

908
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,775
Yeah, Lucifer, he's...

909
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,443
Uh, I don't know.

910
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,126
I don't know where Lucifer is right now.

911
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,114
Yeah, yeah. I'm positive Jed's safe.

912
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,075
Mm-hmm. Okay, bye.

913
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,493
What the hell, man?

914
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,996
Well, you see, Daniel,
the detective is a detective.

915
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,332
So, I'm being a mystery.

916
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,209
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

917
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,294
Jed explains it much better,
don't you, Jed?

918
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,675
[Dan] Huh.

919
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,428
Looks like you just got played, son.

920
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,222
What are you talking about?

921
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,557
Jed's after Chloe.
I told you to watch out for him.

922
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,787
I mean, come on, it's obvious that
he's trying to get between you two

923
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,187
so he can swoop right in.

924
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,189
Jeez.

925
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,149
I'll go see if I can catch him.

926
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,945
[Charlie wails]

927
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,909
What's wrong?

928
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,994
I've been manipulated, brother.

929
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,123
By that mewling little DJ.

930
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,791
Okay, calm down, Lucy.

931
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,086
It's bad enough when Father does it,
but that little cretin!

932
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,088
- They could be right outside.
- Good!

933
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,757
Jed can see who he's really playing with.

934
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,509
- [mystical crackling]
- [Charlie wails]

935
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,677
[growls]

936
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,321
- [growling intensifies]
- [wailing ends]

937
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,187
That's odd.

938
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,397
[Charlie cries]

939
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,234
Do it again, Lucy. Do it again.

940
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,903
Yeah, yeah. Do it again.

941
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,406
[growls]

942
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,410
[Charlie giggles]

943
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,135
- [Dan] Jed isn't out here!
- Lucy, stop!

944
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,207
I'll call in a BOLO.

945
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,084
Who knows where he went.

946
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,462
I'll find him.

947
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,381
- [Charlie cries]
- Jed may have manipulated you, brother,

948
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,465
but you let him.

949
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,887
You're right, I suppose.

950
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,182
Also, I need you to help me
to get Charlie to stop crying.

951
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,893
[growls]

952
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,937
It's just ringing. [clears throat]

953
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,481
I'll just try him again.

954
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,442
You know what?

955
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,695
This is so selfish.

956
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,822
- Yeah.
- I don't know, what, is he ghosting me?

957
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,908
What's up, everybody!

958
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,659
[crowd cheers]

959
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,037
This song goes out to a special lady.

960
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,581
Cherry Jane, this one's for you.

961
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,716
He's not supposed to be here.

962
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,967
I know.

963
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:56,555
But Chloe said that the killer's not here,
right? So he should be safe.

964
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,443
I mean, she looks majorly scary.

965
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,736
That's Karen.

966
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,532
Yeah, well, maybe Karen is Karnalgirl506.

967
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,242
She didn't have a hearing aid.

968
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,744
Well, maybe she just didn't wear it.

969
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,831
Wait, does she have a gun?

970
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,708
Oh, my God, she's going.

971
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,171
[overlapping shouts]

972
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,257
[Karen] Ow!

973
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,424
Maze, what the heck?

974
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,468
I just wanted to take a selfie!

975
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,137
Are you Karnalgirl506?

976
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,472
Yeah.

977
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,562
Ron? Ron, what are you doing?

978
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,273
[overlapping screams]

979
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,073
[Jed] Yo, man, what...

980
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,201
- We can work this out. Just calm down.
- Tell them!

981
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,494
Tell them what you did!

982
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,181
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't know who you are.

983
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,373
But you know who she is.

984
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,626
[gasps]

985
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,839
LAPD. Put down the gun.

986
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,922
No!

987
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,800
They need to know.

988
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,426
He's a homewrecker.

989
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,971
- It was just one night.
- One magical night!

990
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,599
I didn't even know she was married.
She didn't say anything.

991
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,058
You don't need to do this, Ron.

992
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,642
Yes, I do.

993
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,520
She broke my heart.

994
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,939
I messed up with the other DJ,

995
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,733
and then with the explosion.

996
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,194
I'm not gonna screw up this time.

997
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,739
Look, your wife, she...

998
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,074
She disappeared on you.

999
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,285
Completely ghosted you.

1000
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,330
- I love her more than anything.
- [Chloe] Yeah.

1001
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,124
And she left me for this stupid,

1002
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,207
hot,

1003
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,127
charitable DJ.

1004
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,504
It doesn't mean you have to kill anyone,
Ron.

1005
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,466
All my friends gave me a hard time
for not doing anything about it.

1006
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,468
For letting her just walk all over me,

1007
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,219
and they were right!

1008
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,054
[Chloe] Ron.

1009
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,930
Listen.

1010
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,950
You let your friends get into your head.

1011
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,520
- [panicked breaths]
- You should have just talked to her.

1012
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,021
I get it.

1013
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,442
I've been there,
but you have to tell her how you feel.

1014
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,445
That sometimes she drives you crazy,

1015
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,281
that she can be incredibly challenging...

1016
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,994
and headstrong and frustrating...

1017
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,498
but also...

1018
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,708
incredible.

1019
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,631
And that, despite everything...

1020
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,173
you...

1021
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,218
you just want to be with him.

1022
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,261
[sighs] Her.

1023
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,846
Her.

1024
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,058
Ron. Ron...

1025
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,813
you're not going to be able to tell her
anything if I have to shoot you.

1026
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,315
So put down the gun.

1027
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,609
Put it down.

1028
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,112
[whispers] Put it down.

1029
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,114
[panting]

1030
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,617
Please.

1031
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,497
[overlapping screams]

1032
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,624
[Ron grunts, wheezes]

1033
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,879
It's just so heartbreaking.

1034
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,965
Yeah, it's so...

1035
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,136
Oh, God, who am I kidding? I don't care.

1036
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,347
Wait.

1037
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,557
Where's Linda?

1038
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,730
Oh.

1039
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,148
[snoring]

1040
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,779
[handcuffs locking]

1041
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,489
Thanks.

1042
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,454
[police chatter on radio]

1043
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,960
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but...

1044
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,504
thank you for saving my life.

1045
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,589
[chuckles]

1046
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,717
I can't believe I'm going to say this,
but just doing my job.

1047
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,719
That's all it is, isn't it?

1048
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:04,802
What do you mean?

1049
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,890
I'm pretty sure all that talk about
"tell them how you feel"...

1050
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:09,892
wasn't about me.

1051
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,975
[sighs]

1052
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,603
I mean, the thing is,

1053
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,688
Lucifer and I are...

1054
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,191
something. [chuckles]

1055
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,901
But it's...

1056
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,196
It's new and it's complicated.

1057
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,822
How so?

1058
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,364
