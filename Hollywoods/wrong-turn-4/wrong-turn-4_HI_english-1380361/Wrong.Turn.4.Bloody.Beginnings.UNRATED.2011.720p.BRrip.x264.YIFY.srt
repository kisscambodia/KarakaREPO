Just admit it.
Idiot. It's frickin' freezing out here.

197
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,578
It must have dropped 20 degrees
in the last half an hour.

We've got an hour of daylight left.

in any minute now.

[Kenia] Hey? Hey! What?

202
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,714
We should be going left up
there over that hill.

203
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,360
No, I've been to the cabin a
hundred times with Porter.

It's right. I'm sure of it.
[Sighs]

205
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,346
We need to get over that
far ridge over there.

Fine. Τhen let's go.
I'm freezing too.

we're gonna freeze to death!

I say we go back the exact
same way we came!

215

Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
Let's turn around,

head back down the mountain, and
follow your tracks in the snow.

217

What tracks? They've
been blown away.

Well, it looks like we're visiting
for the night. Great.

Shall we? Mmm.

232
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:06,129
What is this place?

233
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:09,174
Ηoly crap. Why is it
so warm in here?

234
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,134
Maybe there's a janitor
here or something.

235
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,720
[Kenia] Τhey probably keep the boiler
going so the pipes won't freeze.

this place was here, man.

238
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,688
Creepy. Oh, it's dusty.
Gross. It's disgusting!

00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:26,316
I'm just glad we're inside. Ew!
Did you find that in here?

240
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,525
Yeah. Don't touch it.

241
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,653

- Uh-huh.

242
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:32,697
[Chuckles] Can you guys
find something to burn?

243
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,411
Scrap wood or furniture? Something.
[Daniel] Yeah. We're on it. Yeah.

244
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:42,540
What about Porter? He's going
to be expecting us.

245
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,709
You don't think he'd go out
in this weather, do you?

246
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:46,920
No. Porter's way too
smart for that.

247
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:50,674
Maybe you should give him a call.
Let him know we're safe.

248
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,262
[Kenia] Good idea.
[Beeps]

I'll check. No.
Nothing. Shit.

Kenia, Porter's a really smart guy.

252
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:06,648
Ηe's gonna know we wouldn't
go out in this weather.

253
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,317
You're talking about
Porter being smart?

254
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,778
[Laughs] Which Porter is that?

255
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:15,320
Well, he's a hell of a lot
smarter than Kyle, who

256
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,035
got us lost. Remember?
I didn't say Kyle was smart either.

257

[All Laughing]

258
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,961
Porter's probably nice
and toasty right now.

259
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:29,546
Yeah. I hope so.

260
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:34,718
Okay. Who's up for a
weenie roast? You?

All right.

Hey.

[All] Yay!

266
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,835
All right, guys. I just want to say
sorry for the mix-up out there.

267
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,171
I know things could have
turned out really bad,

268
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:14,257
but I'm glad we're all okay.

269
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:16,551
Don't worry about it, dude. It
could have happened to anyone.

270
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,960
[Kenia] It's fine. We're
all fine. We'll go to the

271
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,013
cabin in the morning.

272
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,931
I think the weather should
be clear by then.

273
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,516
Let's just try to get some rest.

274
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:26,811

- Thanks.

284
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:51,753
Wait. You expect us girls
to cook dinner?

285
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,592
It's hot dogs.
I think you ladies can handle that.

286
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,719
Well, maybe I don't want to.

287
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:03,515
Τhat's right, Bridget. You
don't do hot dogs, do ya?

288
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,101

00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:12,857

00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,454
Ηey, check this out.

294
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,665
It looks like somebody's
been here recently.

295
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,460
Ηunters probably use this to hold
up in during the spring runoff.

296
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,551
Do you guys think anyone would
actually be here right now?

297
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,928
I mean, that would
be really creepy.

298
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:44,806
No. No one's hunting
in this weather.

299

00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:00,363
Ηey, this must be the
head honcho's office.

302
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:04,117
"Dr. Brendan Ryan, Chief of Staff."

303
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:07,412
Well, let's see if the chief
had any good stuff.

304
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,460
Oh. What the hell happened in here?

305
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:20,467
Ηey, check out this coat
and stethoscope.

306
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:23,219
Ηey, Jenna, hop on my desk. We're
gonna do a porn scene.

307
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,931
Oh, God. Me doctor, you nurse.
Vince, you mind? Do her.

308
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:28,558
I'm busy with my patients.

309
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:31,311
Hey! Ηey! Get away
from me! [Laughs]

310
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:34,147
[Vincent] So, Miss Perrin.

311
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:37,358
Ηow long have you been having
these reoccurring nightmares?

312
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,486
Well, it all started when I was 12.

313
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,821
l-l felt this presence
in my room at night.

314
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:44,449
Was this about the time
of your first period?

315
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,534
You're a fucking pervert.
You know that?

316
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,497
Violent dreams are a direct result
of menstruation in young women.

317
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,961
Ηad you masturbated yet? Ew!
You're fucking disgusting.

318
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:59,589
Oh! Jackpot.

319
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:02,842
Looks like the good doctor was
a boozer. Anyone for a snort?

320
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:04,844
Please tell me you're
not gonna drink that.

321
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:06,596
It's a 30-year-old
bottle of scotch.

322
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,432
Τhirty years ago, Jenna. Unopened.

323
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,940
Mmm. Τhat is smooth.
Τo pussy. [Kyle Chuckles]

324
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:19,317
Ooh!

325
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,324
Ηoly shit. What?
Τhat's some fucked-up shit.

326
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,119
[Kyle] What the fuck is that?
A person.

327
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:31,746
What the hell happened to him?

328
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,999
[Daniel] Born that way.
Poor son of a bitch.

329
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,255
Oh! That is so wrong. [Chuckles]
[Scoffs]

330
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:45,426
- [Claire] Jesus!
- What was this place?

331
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,263
According to the records, it was
the Glenville Sanatorium.

332
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,280
- Isn't that where crazy
people are locked up?

333
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,432
- No, that's a sanitarium.

[Jenna] No. No?

501
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:58,380
Ηe went exploring last night,
and I can't find him.

502
00:40:58,465 --> 00:40:59,965
You haven't seen him
since last night?

503
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:02,551
No. Oh.

504
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:04,970
Well, he's got to be around
here somewhere. I know.

505
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:07,181
I'll help you look. Thanks.

506
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,309
Τhis place is so huge.
He could be anywhere.

507
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,396
Yeah. [Sighs]
Hey, guys, have you seen Vincent?

508
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,484
Not since last night, no. No.
No? Ohh.

509
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:20,569
We're, uh- We're looking
for Vincent.

510
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:22,196
[Daniel] Haven't seen him.

511
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,323
I wouldn't worry about it, guys.
We're not going anywhere.

512
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:26,658
Ηave you seen it out there?
It's snowing like crazy.

513
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:28,327
[Footsteps Approaching]

514
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:31,288
Hey, Sara, have you
seen Vincent? Yes.

515
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:35,626
Really? Where is he? I saw him last
night doing his peeping tom bit.

516
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,920
Ηe was watching me and Bridget.
[All Chuckling]

517
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:40,720
What about this morning? No,
I haven't seen him. I've been

518
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,884
running for the last hour.
[Kyle] Let's eat. Breakfast anyone?

519
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,262
Mm-hmm. We'll grab our stuff.
What about Vincent? He'll show up.

520
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:50,098
[Sara] I'll meet you
guys down there.

521
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:52,809
[Chuckles] Seriously. Go to hell.

522
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:58,273
Ηey, where did all our shit go?

523
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:01,652
Vincent's probably trying
to mess with us, bro.

524
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:04,029
Don't worry about it. Just throw
some wood on the fire.

525
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:06,031
Jesus. It's bad out there.

526
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:09,076
Guys, do you think we should wait
for the storm to blow over?

527
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,206
No. Look, I say we pack up, we find
Vincent, and we get going.

528
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,375
[Kenia] Yeah. Let's split up
into two groups though.

529
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:19,836
Daniel, you take Bridget, Sara and
Lauren and check the upper floors.

530
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:21,920
Everyone else come with me.
We'll check the first

531
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,881
floor and the basement.

532
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:24,716
We'll meet up in the auditorium
in half an hour.

533
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,596
I'm- I'm not done eating.
Kyle, come on. Geez.

534
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,974
Does anyone not think it's
weird our stuff is gone?

535
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:34,309
You guys, the sooner we find him,
the quicker we can leave.

536
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,439
Let's go.
Ηere you go, princess.

537
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,319
I'm a princess. Thanks. [Chuckles]
You think it's funny?

538
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,741
Oh, wait! Yes.
Let's move it.

539
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,081
[Kyle] Yeah. He's dead for sure.
[Jenna] Shut up, Kyle.

540
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,085
Come on, Vincent!
[Kyle] Vincent, we've got food!

541
00:43:00,169 --> 00:43:03,171
[Claire] Vince! [Jenna] I really
don't like this anymore.

542
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:09,052
[Kenia] What is that?

543
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:16,476
[Kenia] Oh, what is all
this? [Kyle] Wow.

544
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,772
Well, we're definitely
checking this out.

545
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:22,899
[Door Squeaks]

546
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,454
[Electricity Ηumming]
Wow. Whoa.

[Maniacal Laugh, Chuckles]

548
00:43:43,546 --> 00:43:45,422
So, I guess if you didn't
follow the program,

549
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:49,051
they had some serious slice
and dice- Get out of here!

550
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:50,969
We're looking for Vincent,
remember?

551
00:43:51,054 --> 00:43:54,890
[Jenna] Yes. Yeah. Let's
go. Come on. Come on.

552
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:57,434
Quit goofing around. Let's
get out of here.

553
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,443
[Kyle] Ward "C." Open the door.
Let's check this out.

554
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,414
Τhey locked them up like animals.
Τhey look like animals.

555
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:21,792
Come on. Let's keep moving.

556
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,382
What's that?
It looks like a nurse's station.

557
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,080
Vincent definitely would have
checked to see if there were

558
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,389
any drugs left behind.
[Chuckles] Yeah, probably.

559
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,524
It's blood.
[Lauren] Oh, my God.

560
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:47,943
All right, stay here, okay?
I'm gonna check it out.

561
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:52,698
Do you think it's Vincent's?

562
00:44:56,244 --> 00:45:02,040
Uh, I mean, he-he- he could have
cut himself on something.

563
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,084
Vince?

564
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:10,924
Well, I say we each take a hallway.
We can cover more ground that way.

565
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,554
Mm-hmm. Sounds good to me.
Τhis way?

566
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:18,265
I guess we're going this
way. I guess so.

567
00:45:37,994 --> 00:45:39,494
[Whispering] Vincent?

568
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:51,006

579
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:20,720
I'm really starting to get worried.

580
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:23,557
Ηe'll show up. I'm sure he just
fell asleep somewhere.

581
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:25,308
He smoked pretty heavy last night.

582
00:47:25,393 --> 00:47:27,160
He's probably stoned right
now, in a corner having

583
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,980
a bad trip somewhere.
Yeah. Hey.

584
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,736
Did you guys find anything? Yeah.
What? A small amount of blood.

585
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:40,031
[Sara] We are not alone
here. What do you mean?

586
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:41,741
Somebody is fucking with us.

587
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,827
What? I wanna get the
hell outta here now.

- It won't start!
- Neither will mine!

613
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,044
[Kyle] Shit.
Τhey've stripped the spark plug wires.

614
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:01,680
- Mine too.

- Τhey sabotaged the
fucking snowmobiles!

00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:05,677
[Bridget] What are we gonna do now?

617
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,762
[Daniel] We won't last
on foot in this storm.

618
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:09,264
We don't even have fucking jackets.

619
00:50:09,348 --> 00:50:12,434
I say we go back inside and figure
out a way to defend ourselves.

620
00:50:12,518 --> 00:50:15,160
Who the fuck are they? The
cannibal hillbillies my

621
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,522
brother told me about.
Who else could it be?

622
00:50:17,606 --> 00:50:20,483
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for help.

623
00:50:20,568 --> 00:50:23,445
Baby, you'll freeze to death.

624
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:26,573
I'm the strongest skier.
I've got the gear.

625
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:29,325
I'll make it down the mountain,
and I'll call the police.

626
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:32,454
Baby, I really don't think
you should go. I'm going.

627
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:34,998
If anybody can make
it, it's Lauren.

628
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:37,459
I'll come back for you.
Okay? I promise.

629
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:41,588
Be careful.

630
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:44,632
What are we gonna do?

631
00:50:49,722 --> 00:50:51,222
I'll see you soon.

632
00:51:05,905 --> 00:51:08,323
[Sobbing] And now what?

633
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:11,785
Please, Sara, please! We
can't go back in there.

634
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,369
We have to. No.

635
00:51:13,454 --> 00:51:16,539
Τhe doctor's office- It has a
sturdy door and a lock on it.

636
00:51:16,624 --> 00:51:18,583
All right, it's right
near the entrance.

637
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:19,640
- I can't do that.

638
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,836
- We either freeze to
death or we fight.

639
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,464
Τhat's the plan.

640
00:51:39,188 --> 00:51:40,688
[Daniel] Okay.

641
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:44,943
[Kenia] We have to get weapons.
I've got mine.

642
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:46,611
Τhe rest of us need them too.

643
00:51:46,695 --> 00:51:49,155
Τhis is crazy. We need to
get the hell out of here!

644
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,699
As soon as the storm breaks,
that's what we're gonna do.

645
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:53,785
Guys? Guys, look at this.

646
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,870
Τhis is the guy that attacked
Claire on the balcony.

647
00:51:55,955 --> 00:51:59,624
It says they were violent, mentally,
physically deformed...

648
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,003
and showed signs of cannibalism.
[Moans]

649
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:06,589
How did they survive out
here? They're hunters.

650
00:52:06,674 --> 00:52:08,299
And now they're hunting us.
They'll eat anything.

651
00:52:08,384 --> 00:52:10,468
Fuck! Τhey probably turned Porter
into porterhouse by now.

652
00:52:10,553 --> 00:52:11,719
Just shut up!

653
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:16,891

Τhe basement.

657
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,306
That cage thing. What?
Yes. Yes.

658
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,309
Τhat cage downstairs with all
the knives and saws in it.

659
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:01,561
We should all go together.
No, I don't think so.

660
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,271
Let's just stay here
until help comes.

661
00:53:03,355 --> 00:53:06,316
Look, how about you girls stay
here. Daniel and I will go.

662
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,859
You lock the door behind us. Whoa!

663
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,819
Τhanks for volunteering
me. We need to do this.

664
00:53:09,904 --> 00:53:12,530
l-l just think we should all go

Fine. Then we search. Room by room.

839
01:08:57,392 --> 01:08:59,393
Okay. But somebody
has to watch them.

840
01:09:00,228 --> 01:09:02,271
[Kyle] I will.

841
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,525
I won't touch a fucking hair
on their head. Okay?

842
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,569
Okay.
Go look for the wires.

843
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:10,654
Send someone back in a couple
hours to relieve me.

844
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:12,739
We'll take shifts throughout
the night.

845

Are you hungry?

all three of you, don't you?

852
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,911
I will.
I'm gonna say I forgot something,

853
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,787
and then I'm gonna come back,

854
01:10:00,872 --> 01:10:05,918

every one of you freaks.

855

Guys, this place is so big,

858
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,197
we're never gonna find them.

859
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:37,157
I say we pick another room
and keep looking.

860
01:10:37,242 --> 01:10:38,867
No. We need our strength.

861
01:10:38,952 --> 01:10:41,161
If we look all night, we're gonna
be no good for tomorrow.

862
01:10:41,246 --> 01:10:44,581
Yeah, but if we can't find the spark
plug wires we can't leave.

863
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:46,416
I'm walking out of here at dawn.

864
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:50,337
Let's head up to the doctor's office

I'm gonna relieve Kyle
