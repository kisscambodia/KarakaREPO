1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,160
This is your lunch, OK?

2
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,330
Now, I put a dollar in there
so you can buy some milk.

3
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,230
You can ask one of the big kids
where to do that.

4
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,900
You remember your phone number?
I wrote it down for you, just in case.

5
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,590
Put it in your pocket,
I don't want you to lose it.

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,560
OK? You ready?

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,040
I think so.

8
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,110
It's Cady's big day.

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,540
I guess it's natural for parents to cry
on their kid's first day of school.

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,410
But, you know, this usually
happens when the kid is 5.

11
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm 16 and until today,
I was home-schooled.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,130
I know what you're thinking.
"Home-schooled kids are freaks."

13
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,960
X-Y-L-O-C-A-R-P.
Xylocarp.

14
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,460
Or that we're weirdly religious
or something.

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,170
And on the third day, God created
the Remington bolt-achion rifle

16
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,770
so that Man could fight the dinosaurs.

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,770
And the homosexuals.

18
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,380
- Amen.
- Amen.

19
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,980
But my family's totally normal.

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,150
Except for the fact that both my
parents are research zoologists

21
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,480
and we've spent the last
12 years in Africa.

22
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,050
I had a great life.

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,620
But then my mom got offered tenure
at Northwestern University.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,190
So it was goodbye Africa
and hello high school.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,090
I'm OK. Sorry.

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,700
I'll be careful.

27
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,960
Hi.

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,030
I don't know if anyone
told you about me.

29
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,530
I'm a new student here.
My name is Cady Heron.

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,600
Talk to me again
and I'll kick your ass.

31
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,640
You don't wanna sit there. Kristen
Hadley's boyfriend is gonna sit there.

32
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,640
Hey, baby.

33
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,720
He farts a lot.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,860
Hey, everybody.

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,530
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,900
It's not you. I'm bad luck.

37
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,140
Ms. Norbury?

38
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,940
My T-shirt's stuck
to my sweater, isn't it?

39
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,080
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,580
Is everything all right in here?

41
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,050
- Oh, yeah.
- So...

42
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,350
...how was your summer?
- I got divorced.

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,520
My carpal tunnel came back.

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,530
- I win.
- Yes, you do.

45
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,290
Well, I just wanted to let
everyone know

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
that we have a new student joining us.

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,230
She just moved here
all the way from Africa.

48
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,000
Welcome.

49
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,470
- I'm from Michigan.
- Great.

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,410
Her name is Cady. Cady Heron.

51
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,170
- Where are you, Cady?
- That's me.

52
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,940
- It's pronounced like Katie.
- My apologies.

53
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,780
I have a nephew named Anfernee,

54
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,280
and I know how mad he gets
when I call him Anthony.

55
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,320
Almost as mad as I get
when I think about the fact

56
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,150
that my sister named him Anfernee.

57
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,390
Well, welcome, Cady.

58
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,560
- And thank you, Mr. Duvall.
- Well, thank you.

59
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
And...

60
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,300
...if you need anything or if you
wanna talk to somebody...

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,730
Thanks.

62
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,340
Maybe some other time,
when my shirt isn't see-through.

63
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,500
OK.

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,910
OK. Good day, everybody.

65
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,380
The first day of school was a blur.

66
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,350
A stressful, surreal blur.

67
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,710
I got in trouble for the
most random things.

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,620
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.

69
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,650
You need the lavatory pass.

70
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,130
OK. Can I have the lavatory pass?

71
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,420
Nice try. Have a seat.

72
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,730
I had never lived in a world
where adults didn't trust me,

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,330
where they were always yelling at me.

74
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,160
- Don't read ahead!
- No green pen!

75
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,530
No food in class!

76
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,980
I told you, I saw the whole thing.

77
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,850
- Everything.
- Did you see nipple?

78
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,620
- It only counts if you saw a nipple.
- That's true, dude.

79
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,850
I had a lot of friends in Africa.

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,620
What?

81
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,820
But so far, none in Evanston.

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,870
Hey. How was your first day?

83
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,360
Is that your natural hair color?

84
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,800
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,230
Thank you.

86
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,190
See, this is the color I want.

87
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,870
This is Damian.
He's almost too gay to function.

88
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,210
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice wig, Janis.

89
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,740
- What's it made of?
- Your mom's chest hair!

90
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,010
- I'm Janis.
- Hi, I'm Cady.

91
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,920
Do you guys know
where Room G 14 is?

92
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,020
"Health, Tuesday/Thursday,
Room G 14."

93
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,620
I think that's in the back building.

94
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,290
- Yeah, that's in the back building.
- Yeah, we'll take you there.

95
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,690
Thanks.

96
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,230
Watch out, please!
New meat coming through!

97
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,470
"Health. Spanish."

98
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,730
You're taking 12th-grade calculus?

99
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,710
- Yeah, I like math.
- Why?

100
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,810
Because it's the same
in every country.

101
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,650
That's beautiful. This girl is deep.

102
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,880
Where's the back building?

103
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,390
It burned down in 1987.

104
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,080
Won't we get in some
sort of trouble for this?

105
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,120
Why would we get you into trouble?

106
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,020
We're your friends.

107
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,090
I know it's wrong to skip class,
but Janis said we were friends.

108
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,890
And I was in no position
to pass up friends.

109
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,300
I guess I'll never know what I missed
on that first day of health class.

110
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,410
Don't have sex. Because you
will get pregnant and die.

111
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,310
Don't have sex
in the missionary position,

112
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,940
don't have sex standing up.

113
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,610
Just don't do it, promise?

114
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,510
OK, everybody take some rubbers.

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,710
Why didn't they just keep
home-schooling you?

116
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,650
They wanted me to get socialized.

117
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,450
Oh, you'll get socialized, all right.
A little slice like you.

118
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,760
- What are you talking about?
- You're a regulation hottie.

119
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,960
- What?
- Own it.

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,600
How do you spell your
name again, Cady?

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,130
It's Cady. C-A-D-Y.

122
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cady.

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,340
In the name of all that is holy, will you
look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?

124
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,200
Of course all The Plastics
are in the same gym class.

125
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,070
- Who are The Plastics?
- They're teen royalty.

126
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,480
If North Shore was Us Weekly,
they would always be on the cover.

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,280
That one there, that's Karen Smith.

128
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,850
She is one of the dumbest
girls you will ever meet.

129
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,550
Damian sat next to her
in English last year.

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,560
She asked me how to spell "orange".

131
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,500
And that little one?
That's Gretchen Wieners.

132
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,190
She's totally rich because
her dad invented Toaster Strudel.

133
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,990
Gretchen Wieners knows
everybody's business.

134
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,030
She knows everything
about everyone.

135
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,000
That's why her hair is so big.
It's full of secrets.

136
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,840
And evil takes a human
form in Regina George.

137
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't be fooled, because she may seem
like your typical selfish, back-stabbing,

138
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,580
slut-faced ho-bag. But in reality,
she is so much more than that.

139
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,020
She's the queen bee.

140
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,780
The star. Those other two
are just her little workers.

141
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,580
Regina George.

142
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,730
How do I even begin
to explain Regina George?

143
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,690
Regina George is flawless.

144
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,160
She has two Fendi purses
and a silver Lexus.

145
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,390
I hear her hair's insured
for $10,000.

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,400
I hear she does car commercials.
In Japan.

147
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,340
Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues.

148
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,170
One time, she met John Stamos
on a plane.

149
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,870
And he told her she was pretty.

150
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,100
One time,
she punched me in the face.

151
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,940
It was awesome.

152
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,280
She always looks fierce.
She always wins Spring Fling Queen.

153
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,450
- Who cares?
- I care.

154
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,490
Every year, the seniors throw
this dance for the underclassmen

155
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,950
called The Spring Fling.

156
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,250
And whomsoever is elected
Spring Fling King and Queen

157
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,330
automatically becomes head of the
Student Activities Committee.

158
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,360
And since I am an active member
of the Student Activities Committee,

159
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,560
I would say, yeah, I care.

160
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,860
Damian, you've truly
out-gayed yourself.

161
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,830
Here. This map is gonna
be your guide to North Shore.

162
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,530
Now, where you sit in
the cafeteria is crucial

163
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,150
because you got everybody there.

164
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,910
You got your freshmen,
ROTC guys,

165
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,050
preps, JV jocks,

166
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,480
Asian nerds,

167
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,720
cool Asians,

168
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,390
varsity jocks,

169
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,790
unfriendly black hotties,

170
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,320
girls who eat their feelings,

171
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,790
girls who don't eat anything,

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,470
desperate wannabes,

173
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,160
burnouts,

174
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,440
sexually active band geeks,

175
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,940
the greatest people
you will ever meet

176
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,710
and the worst.
Beware of The Plastics.

177
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,610
Hey. We're doing a lunchtime
survey of new students.

178
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,080
Can you answer a few questions?

179
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,250
- OK.
- Is your muffin buttered?

180
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,390
What?

181
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,660
Would you like us to assign
someone to butter your muffin?

182
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,830
- My what?
- Is he bothering you?

183
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,000
Jason, why are you such a skeez?

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,760
I'm just being friendly.

185
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,770
You were supposed
to call me last night.

186
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,100
Jason. You do not come to a party
at my house with Gretchen

187
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,800
and then scam on some poor, innocent
girl right in front of us three days later.

188
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,480
She's not interested.

189
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,940
Do you wanna have sex with him?

190
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,720
- No, thank you.
- Good. So it's settled.

191
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,510
So you can go shave your back now.

192
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,580
Bye, Jason.

193
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,620
Bitch.

194
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,660
Wait. Sit down.

195
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,650
Seriously, sit down.

196
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,590
Why don't I know you?

197
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm new. I just moved here from Africa.

198
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,870
- What?
- I used to be home-schooled.

199
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,440
Wait. What?

200
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,400
- My mom taught me at home...
- No, no.

201
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,080
I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.

202
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,400
So you've actually never been
to a real school before?

203
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,570
Shut up.

204
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,880
Shut up.

205
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,990
- I didn't say anything.
- Home-schooled.

206
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,520
- That's really interesting.
- Thanks.

207
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,190
But you're, like, really pretty.

208
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,620
- Thank you.
- So you agree.

209
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,560
- What?
- You think you're really pretty.

210
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,030
- Oh, I don't know...
- Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.

211
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,070
- Where did you get it?
- Oh, my mom made it for me.

212
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,860
- It's adorable.
- Oh, it's so fetch.

213
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,440
- What is "fetch"?
- Oh, it's, like, slang. From England.

214
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,080
So if you're from Africa...

215
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,340
...why are you white?

216
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,710
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just
ask people why they're white.

217
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,410
Could you give us some privacy
for, like, one second?

218
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,420
Yeah, sure.

219
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,860
What are you doing?

220
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,750
OK, you should just know
that we don't do this a lot,

221
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,230
so this is, like, a really huge deal.

222
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,130
We wanna invite you
to have lunch with us

223
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,960
every day for the rest of the week.

224
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,100
- Oh, it's OK...
- Coolness.

225
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,530
So we'll see you tomorrow.

226
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,000
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.

227
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,410
Oh, my God!
OK, you have to do it, OK?

228
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,240
And then you have to tell me all
the horrible things that Regina says.

229
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,310
Regina seems sweet.

230
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,080
Regina George is not sweet.

231
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,850
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!

232
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,750
She's fabulous, but she's evil.

233
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,950
- Hey, get out of here!
- Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.

234
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,990
I love your work!

235
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,990
- Why do you hate her?
- What do you mean?

236
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,130
Regina. You seem to really hate her.

237
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,130
Yes. What's your question?

238
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,390
- Well, my question is, why?
- Regina started this rumor

239
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,470
- that Janis was...
- Damian! Shall we not?

240
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,330
Now, look. This isn't
about hating her, OK?

241
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,300
I just think that it would be, like,
a fun little experiment

242
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,070
if you were to hang out with them and
then tell us everything that they say.

243
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,340
- What do we even talk about?
- Hair products.

244
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,280
- Ashton Kutcher.
- Is that a band?

245
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,040
Would you just do it? Please?

246
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,980
OK, fine.
Do you have anything pink?

247
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,950
- Yes.
- No.

248
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,220
By eigtht period, I was so happy
to get to math class.

249
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,830
I mean, I'm good at math.
I understand math.

250
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,930
Nothing in math class
could mess me up.

251
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,300
Hey, do you have a pencil
I can borrow?

252
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,630
I've only had one other
crush in my life.

253
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,810
His name was Nfume,
and we were 5.

254
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,340
It didn't work out.

255
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,610
But this one hit me like a big,
yellow school bus.

256
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,880
- Cady, what do you say?
- He was...

257
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,520
So cute.

258
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,420
I mean, A-sub-N equals
N plus one over four.

259
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,090
That's right.

260
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,260
That's good. Very good.

261
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,290
All right, let's talk
about your homework.

262
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,230
Hey. How was your second day?

263
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,730
- Fine.
- Were people nice?

264
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,500
- No.
- Did you make any friends?

265
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,700
Yeah.

266
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,370
Having lunch with The Plastics
was like leaving the actual world

267
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,070
and entering "Girl World".

268
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,310
And Girl World had a lot of rules.

269
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,420
You can't wear a tank top
two days in a row,

270
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,320
and you can only wear your
hair in a ponytail once a week.

271
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,260
So I guess you picked today.

272
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,650
Oh, and we only wear jeans
or track pants on Fridays.

273
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,200
Now, if you break any of these rules,
you can't sit with us at lunch.

274
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,390
I mean, not just you. Like, any of us.

275
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,400
OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today,

276
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,870
I would be sitting over there
with the art freaks.

277
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,270
Oh, and we always vote before we ask
someone to eat lunch with us

278
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,280
because you have to be considerate
of the rest of the group.

279
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,670
Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt
without asking your friends first

280
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
- if it looks good on you.
- I wouldn't?

281
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,220
Right.
Oh, and it's the same with guys.

282
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,880
Like, you may think you like someone,
but you could be wrong.

283
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,260
A hundred and twenty calories and 48
calories from fat. What percent is that?

284
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,400
Forty-eight into 120?

285
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,230
I'm only eating foods with less than
30 percent calories from fat.

286
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,030
It's 40 percent.

287
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,400
Well, 48 over 120
equals X over 100,

288
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,940
and then you cross-multiply
and get the value of X.

289
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,740
Whatever. I'm getting cheese fries.

290
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,210
So have you seen any guys
that you think are cute yet?

291
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,780
Well, there's this guy
in my calculus class...

292
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,820
- Who is it?
- It's a senior?

293
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,580
- His name's Aaron Samuels.
- No!

294
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,760
Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.

295
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,620
That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.

296
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,060
They went out for a year.

297
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,630
Yeah, and then she was devastated

298
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,230
when he broke up
with her last summer.

299
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,560
I thought she dumped him
for Shane Oman.

300
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,430
OK, irregardless. Ex-boyfriends
are just off-limits to friends.

301
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,000
I mean, that's just, like,
the rules of feminism.

302
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,040
Don't worry. I'll never tell Regina
what you said.

303
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,080
It'll be our little secret.

304
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,250
We define the sum
of the infinite geometric series...

305
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,280
Even though I wasn't
allowed to like Aaron,

306
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,180
I was still allowed to look at him.

307
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,820
And think about him.

308
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,190
And talk to him.

309
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,130
- Hey, Aar...
- Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?

310
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,560
- Yeah.
- I'm Kevin Gnapoor,

311
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,260
captain of the North Shore Mathletes.

312
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,600
We participate in math challenges
against other high schools in the state,

313
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,070
and we can get twice as much funding
if we've got a girl.

314
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,830
So you should think about joining.

315
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,540
- Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
- Yeah, definitely.

316
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,010
Great, great.
Let me give you my card.

317
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,780
OK, so think it over.

318
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,050
Because we'd like to get jackets.

319
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,420
OK.

320
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,470
Hey!

321
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,200
Get in, loser. We're going shopping.

322
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,800
Regina's like the Barbie doll
I never had.

323
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,380
I'd never seen anybody
so glamorous.

324
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,810
- So how do you like North Shore?
- It's good.

325
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,460
I think I'm joining the Mathletes.

326
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,890
- No! No, no.
- No, no.

327
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,650
You cannot do that.
That is social suicide.

328
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,490
Damn, you are so lucky
you have us to guide you.

329
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,900
Being at Old Orctard Mall kind of
reminded me of being home in Africa.

330
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,410
By the watering hole.
When the animals are in heat.

331
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,790
Oh, my God, there's Jason!

332
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,690
Where? Oh, there he is.

333
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,730
- And he's with Taylor Wedell.
- I heard they're going out.

334
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,530
Wait. Jason's not going out
with Taylor.

335
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,070
No. He cannot blow you off like that.

336
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,540
He's such a little skeez.
Give me your phone.

337
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,070
- You're not gonna call him, right?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

338
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,840
No.

339
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,810
- Wedell on South Boulevard.
- Caller ID.

340
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,680
Not when you connect
from Information.

341
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,110
- Hello?
- Hello.

342
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,750
May I please speak
to Taylor Wedell?

343
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,580
She's not home yet. Who's calling?

344
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,760
Oh, this is Susan from
Planned Parenthood.

345
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,550
I have her test results. If you can have
her give me a call as soon as she can.

346
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,060
It's urgent. Thank you.

347
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,990
She's not going out with anyone.

348
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
OK, that was so fetch.

349
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,010
Mom.

350
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,490
Your house is really nice.

351
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,630
I know, right?

352
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,390
Make sure you check out
her mom's boob job.

353
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
They're hard as rocks.

354
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,500
I'm home! Hey, Kylie.

355
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,530
Hey.

356
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,500
Hey, hey, hey!
How are my best girlfriends?

357
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,480
Hey, Mrs. George. This is Cady.

358
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,710
Hello, sweetheart.

359
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,420
- Hi.
- Welcome to our home.

360
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,720
Just want you to know, if you need
anything, don't be shy, OK?

361
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,830
There are no rules in this house.
I'm not like a regular mom.

362
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,620
I'm a cool mom. Right, Regina?

363
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,300
- Please stop talking.
- OK.

364
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,590
I'm gonna make you girls
a "hump day" treat.

365
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,870
This is your room?

366
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,310
It was my parents' room,
but I made them trade me.

367
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,020
Hey, put on 98.8.

368
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,160
Cady, do you even know
who sings this?

369
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,430
- The Spice Girls?
- I love her.

370
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,890
She's like a Martian.

371
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,430
- God, my hips are huge!
- Oh, please. I hate my calves.

372
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,330
At least you guys can wear halters.
I've got man shoulders.

373
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,160
I used to think there
was just fat and skinny.

374
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,770
Apparently, there's a lot of things
that can be wrong on your body.

375
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,770
- My hairline is so weird.
- My pores are huge.

376
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,270
My nail beds suck.

377
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,550
I have really bad breath
in the morning.

378
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,210
Hey, you guys.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6!

379
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,650
Thanks.

380
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,400
Is there alcohol in this?

381
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,050
Oh, God, honey, no. What kind
of mother do you think I am?

382
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,460
Do you want a bit? If you're gonna
drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.

383
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,190
- No, thank you.
- OK.

384
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,870
So, you guys, what is the 411?

385
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,670
What has everybody been up to?

386
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,910
What is the hot gossip?
Tell me everything.

387
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,240
What are you guys listening to?
What's the cool jams?

388
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,820
Mom.

389
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,420
- Could you go fix your hair?
- OK.

390
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,060
You girls keep me young.
Oh, I love you so much.

391
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,960
Oh, my God, I remember this.

392
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,290
- I haven't looked at that in forever.
- Come check it out, Cady.

393
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,730
It's our Burn Book.

394
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,770
See, we cut out girls' pictures
from the yearbook,

395
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,900
and then we wrote comments.

396
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,100
- "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
- Still true.

397
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,770
- "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
- Still half true.

398
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,780
"Amber D'Alessio."
She made out with a hot dog.

399
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,090
"Janis Ian, dyke."

400
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,290
- Who is that?
- I think that's that kid Damian.

401
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah. He's almost too gay
to function.

402
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,250
That's funny. Put that in there.

403
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,630
Oh, no. Maybe that was only OK
when Janis said it.

404
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,440
And they have this Burn Book
where they write mean things

405
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,100
- about all the girls in our grade.
- What does it say about me?

406
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,630
- You're not in it.
- Those bitches.

407
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,540
- Will this minimize my pores?
- No. Cady,

408
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,210
you gotta steal that book.

409
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,140
- No way!
- Oh, come on. We could publish it,

410
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,820
and then everybody would see
what an ax-wound she really is.

411
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,710
- I don't steal.
- That is for your feet.

412
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,910
Cady, there are two kinds
of evil people.

413
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,520
People who do evil stuff,

414
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,320
and people who see evil stuff
being done and don't try to stop it.

415
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,070
Does that mean I'm morally
obligated to burn that lady's outfit?

416
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,900
Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.

417
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,530
I love seeing teachers
outside of school.

418
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,830
It's like seeing a dog
walk on its hind legs.

419
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,010
Hey, guys, what's up?
I didn't know you worked here.

420
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,770
Yeah, moderately priced soaps
are my calling.

421
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,880
- You shopping?
- No, I'm just here with my boyfriend.

422
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,810
Joking. Sometimes older people
make jokes.

423
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,580
My nana takes her wig off
when she's drunk.

424
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,880
Your nana and I have that
in common.

425
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,790
No, actually, I'm just here because
I bartend a couple nights a week

426
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,720
down at P. J. Calamity's.

427
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
Cady, I hope you do
join Mathletes, you know,

428
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,160
because we start in a couple weeks

429
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,000
and I would love
to have a girl on the team,

430
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,500
just, you know, so the team
could meet a girl.

431
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,670
- I think I'm gonna do it.
- Great.

432
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,140
You can't join Mathletes.
It's social suicide.

433
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,640
Thanks, Damian.

434
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,400
Well, this has been
sufficiently awkward.

435
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,550
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

436
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,340
- Bye.
- Bye.

437
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,720
Oh, man, that is bleak.

438
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,790
So when are you gonna
see Regina again?

439
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,060
I can't spy on her anymore.
It's weird.

440
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,100
Come on, she's never gonna find out.
It'll be like our little secret.

441
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,030
- Hello?
- I know your secret.

442
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,470
Oh, God, busted.

443
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,900
Just start apologizing and crying.
No, play it cool.

444
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,700
Secret?
What are you saying about?

445
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,040
Gretchen told me
that you like Aaron Samuels.

446
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,440
I mean, I don't care,
do whatever you want.

447
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,980
But let me just tell you something
about Aaron:

448
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,520
All he cares about is school
and his mom and his friends.

449
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,990
- Is that bad?
- But if you like him...

450
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,350
Whatever. I mean, I could talk
to him for you if you want.

451
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,430
Really? You would do that? I mean,
nothing embarrassing, though, right?

452
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,220
Oh, no, trust me.
I know exactly how to play it.

453
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,660
But wait. Aren't you so mad
at Gretchen for telling me?

454
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,240
- No.
- Because if you are,

455
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,640
you can tell me. It was a really
bitchy thing for her to do.

456
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,810
Yeah, it was pretty bitchy,
but I'm not mad.

457
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,380
I mean, I guess she just
likes the attention.

458
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,210
See, Gretch? I told you
she's not mad at you.

459
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,970
I can't believe you think
I like attention!

460
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,880
OK, love you. See you tomorrow.

461
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,620
I had survived my first
three-way calling attack.

462
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,550
And with Regina's blessing, I started
talking to Aaron more and more.

463
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,230
On October 3rd, he asked me
what day it was.

464
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,190
It's October 3rd.

465
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,260
Two weeks later, we spoke again.

466
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,160
It's raining.

467
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,890
Yeah.

468
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,870
But I wanted things to move faster.

469
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,440
So I followed my instincts.

470
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,370
Hey, I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?

471
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,810
- But I wasn't lost.
- Yeah.

472
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,880
I knew exactly what Ms. Norbury
was talking about.

473
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,050
It's a factorial, so you multiply
each one by N.

474
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,480
Wrong.

475
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,980
Is that the summation?

476
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,650
Yeah, they're the same thing.

477
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,720
Wrong. He was so wrong.

478
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,160
Thanks. I... I get it now.

479
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,030
Lights, please.
OK. See you guys tomorrow.

480
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,460
We're having a Halloween party
at my friend Chris' tonight.

481
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,940
You wanna come?

482
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,800
Yeah, sure.

483
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,240
Great. Here's where it is.

484
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,740
It's a costume party.
People get pretty into it.

485
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,550
OK.

486
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,880
That flier admits one person only,

487
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,180
so don't bring some
other guy with you.

488
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,210
"Grool."

489
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,150
I meant to say "cool"
and then I started to say "great".

490
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,490
Right. Well... grool.

491
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,730
See you tonight.

492
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,090
Hey, Africa. You staying
for the Mathletes meeting?

493
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,330
Yeah, I'll be right back.

494
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,910
OK, I lied. But I had to go home
and work on my costume.

495
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,440
In the regular world, Halloween is
when children dress up in costumes

496
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,980
and beg for candy.

497
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,740
In Girl World, Halloween
is the one nigth a year

498
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,540
when a girl can dress
like a total slut

499
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,720
and no other girls can
say anything about it.

500
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,750
The hard-core girls just wear lingerie

501
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,550
and some form of animal ears.

502
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,560
Doesn't she look great, honey?

503
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,600
- What are you?
- I'm a mouse.

504
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,590
Unfortunately, no one told
me about the slut rule.

505
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,530
So I showed up like this.

506
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,970
Hey.

507
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,710
Yes! Yes!

508
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,150
Hey.

509
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,460
Why are you dressed so scary?

510
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,620
It's Halloween.

511
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,320
Have you seen Jason?

512
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,760
You know who's looking fine tonight?

513
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,990
Seth Mosakowski.

514
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,970
- OK, you did not just say that.
- What? He's a good kisser.

515
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,510
He's your cousin.

516
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,470
Yeah, but he's my first cousin.

517
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,850
- Right.
- So you have your cousins

518
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,710
and then you have your first cousins,

519
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,480
- then you have your second cousins...
- No, honey.

520
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,520
That's not right, is it?

521
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,310
That is so not right.

522
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,510
- Hey!
- Hey.

523
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,190
You made it.

524
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,350
And you are... a zombie bride.

525
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,260
An "ex-wife".

526
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,490
Love it. Can I get you
something to drink?

527
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,170
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

528
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,100
Thanks.

529
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,200
Karen, stop it.

530
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,840
- Don't, Karen...
- Hey, Seth!

531
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,780
Hey.

532
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,680
Oh, no.

533
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,210
Didn't anybody tell you?

534
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,980
You were supposed
to wear a costume.

535
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,320
Shut up. I need to talk to you.

536
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,890
- You know that girl Cady?
- Yeah, she's cool.

537
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,390
I invited her tonight.

538
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,160
Well, be careful because
she has a huge crush on you.

539
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,730
Really? How do you know?

540
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,200
Because she told me.

541
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,870
She tells everybody.
It's kind of cute, actually.

542
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,730
She's like a little girl. She, like,
writes all over her notebook,

543
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,270
"Mrs. Aaron Samuels."

544
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,940
And she made this T-shirt that says
"I heart Aaron"

545
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,980
and she wears it
under all her clothes.

546
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,410
- Oh, come on.
- Well, who can blame her?

547
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,980
I mean, you're gorgeous.

548
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,210
And OK, look, I'm not saying
she's a stalker,

549
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,950
but she saved
this Kleenex you used

550
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,600
and she said she's gonna do
some kind of African voodoo with it

551
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,460
to make you like her.

552
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,260
What?

553
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,870
This was it.

554
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,440
Regina said she would talk
to Aaron for me, and now she was.

555
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,080
I know she's kind of socially retarded
and weird, but she's my friend,

556
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,910
so just promise me
you won't make fun of her.

557
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,670
Of course I'm not gonna
make fun of her.

558
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,940
How could Janis hate Regina?

559
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,210
Ste was such a good...

560
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,450
Slut!

561
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,550
What are you doing?
You broke up with me.

562
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,600
That's crazy. Why would
I break up with you?

563
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,000
You're so hot.

564
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,640
That's a scary mask, bro.

565
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,710
I had never felt this feeling before.

566
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,580
I could tear my heartbeat in my ears.

567
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,910
My stomach felt like it was
going to fall out my butt.

568
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,180
I had this lump in my throat like
after you dry-swallow a big pill.

569
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,120
I hated Regina. I hated her!

570
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,700
She took him back.

571
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,570
Regina took Aaron back.

572
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,970
- Oh, no, Cady.
- Why would she do that?

573
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,810
Because she's a life-ruiner.

574
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,750
She ruins people's lives.

575
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,050
When we were 13, she made
people sign this petition

576
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,120
- saying that Janis was...
- Damian! Please!

577
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,190
Look, she's not gonna get away
with this again, OK?

578
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,050
- We're gonna do something.
- We are?

579
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,920
Regina George is an evil dictator.

580
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,490
Now, how do you overthrow a dictator?

581
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,100
You cut off her resources.

582
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,430
Regina would be nothing without
her high-status man candy...

583
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,530
...technically good physique...

584
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,410
...and ignorant band of loyal followers.

585
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,510
Now, Cady, if we want this to work,

586
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,120
you are gonna have to keep hanging
out with them like nothing is wrong.

587
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,950
Can you do it?

588
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,520
I can do it.

589
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,590
OK, let's rock this bitch.

590
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,160
Pretending like nothing was wrong
turned out to be surprisingly easy.

591
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,390
Regina wanted me to tell you that she
was trying to hook you up with Aaron,

592
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,800
but he was just interested
in getting her back.

593
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,340
And that's not Regina's fault.

594
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,870
- No, I know.
- OK, so you're not mad at Regina?

595
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,630
- God, no.
- Oh, OK, good.

596
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,540
Because Regina wanted me
to give you this.

597
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,450
It's called
the South Beach Fat Flush,

598
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,880
and all you drink is
cranberry juice for 72 hours.

599
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,320
This isn't even cranberry juice.

600
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,620
It's cranberry juice cocktail.
It's all sugar.

601
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,920
- I wanna lose 3 pounds.
- You're crazy.

602
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,490
Why do you wear your hair like that?
You hair looks so sexy pushed back.

603
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,790
Cady, will you please tell him
his hair looks sexy pushed back.

604
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,730
Regina was dangling Aaron
in front of me on purpose.

605
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,340
I knew how this would be
settled in the animal world.

606
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,280
But this was Girl World.

607
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,250
Your hair looks sexy pushed back.

608
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,250
And in Girl World,
all the figthing had to be sneaky.

609
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,060
All this cranberry juice
is making me break out.

610
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,900
Wait. I have this really good
skin stuff I'll bring you.

611
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,070
OK.

612
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,970
We kept our eyes open
for opportunities for sabotage.

613
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,110
Regina.

614
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,810
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

615
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

616
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,960
Your face smells like peppermint.

617
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,860
This is ass, you guys.

618
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,270
It's been a month, and all we've done
is make Regina's face smell like a foot.

619
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,700
I've been really busy with choir.

620
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,460
We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners.

621
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,400
We crack Gretchen,
and then we crack the lock

622
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,300
on Regina's whole dirty history.

623
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,030
- Say "crack" again.
- Crack.

624
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,240
- All right, let's reconvene tonight.
- I can't.

625
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,920
I have to go to Regina's
to practise for the talent show.

626
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,980
- We're doing a dance to this song...
- "Jingle Bell Rock."

627
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,410
You guys know that song?

628
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,110
Everybody in the English-speaking
world knows that song.

629
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,950
They do it every year.

630
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,060
Well, I have to learn it.

631
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,960
Go.

632
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,130
- Hey.
- Why were you talking to Janis Ian?

633
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,730
I don't know, I mean, she's so weird.

634
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,770
She just, you know, came up to me
and started talking to me about crack.

635
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,870
She's so pathetic.

636
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,500
Let me tell you something
about Janis Ian.

637
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,230
We were best friends
in middle school.

638
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,670
I know, right?

639
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,710
It's so embarrassing.
I don't even... Whatever.

640
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,510
So then in eighth grade, I started
going out with my first boyfriend,

641
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,740
Kyle, who was totally gorgeous,
but then he moved to Indiana.

642
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,350
And Janis was, like,
weirdly jealous of him.

643
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,720
Like, if I would blow her off
to hang out with Kyle,

644
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,920
she'd be like,
"Why didn't you call me back?"

645
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,000
And I'd be like, "Why are you
so obsessed with me?"

646
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,960
So then, for my birthday party,
which was an all-girls pool party,

647
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,100
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you,
because I think you're a lesbian."

648
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,710
I mean, I couldn't
have a lesbian at my party.

649
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,970
There are gonna be girls there
in their bathing suits.

650
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,670
I mean, right?
She was a lesbian.

651
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,210
So then her mom called my mom
and started yelling at her.

652
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,780
It was so retarded.

653
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,250
And then she dropped out of school
because no one would talk to her.

654
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,350
When she came back
in the fall for high school,

655
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,040
all of her hair was cut off
and she was totally weird,

656
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,590
and now I guess she's on crack.

657
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,090
Oh, my God!
I love your skirt.

658
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,020
Where did you get it?

659
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,790
It was my mom's in the '80s.

660
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,390
Vintage. So adorable.

661
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,300
Thanks.

662
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,030
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt
I've ever seen.

663
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,270
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?

664
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,410
So are you gonna send
any candy canes?

665
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,880
No. I don't send them,
I just get them.

666
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,750
So you better send me one, byotch.

667
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,180
Love you.

668
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,090
I was definitely sending her one.

669
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,920
I was gonna use three candy canes
to crack Gretchen Wieners.

670
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,360
Three, please.

671
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,230
"Why, Man, he doth bestride
the narrow world like a colossus"

672
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,090
might translate into

673
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,670
"Why is he so huge
and obnoxious?"

674
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,740
- Candy cane-grams!
- OK, hurry up.

675
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,570
Taylor Zimmerman?
Two for you.

676
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,270
Glenn Cocco?

677
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,180
Four for you, Glenn Cocco.
You go, Glenn Cocco.

678
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,440
And Cady Heron.

679
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,950
Do we have a Cady Heron here?

680
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,680
- It's Cady.
- Oh, Cady, here you go.

681
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,290
One for you. And none
for Gretchen Wieners. Bye.

682
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,590
Who's that from?

683
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,390
"Thanks for being such
a great friend. Love, Regina."

684
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,260
That's so sweet.

685
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,970
OK, back to Caesar.

686
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,340
Once Gretchen thought
Regina was mad at her,

687
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,340
the secrets started pouring out.

688
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,570
All I had to do was wait for one
we could use.

689
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,250
Thank you.

690
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,940
Welcome to the North Shore
High School winter talent show.

691
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,810
Let me hear you make some noise.

692
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,950
All right, settle down.

693
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,760
Our first act calls himself
a star on the rise.

694
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,230
Let's hear it for Damian.

695
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,040
Don't look at me.

696
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,850
Every day is so wonderful

697
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,340
I mean, why would Regina send
you guys candy canes and not me?

698
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,020
Maybe she forgot about you.

699
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,090
Yeah, Regina has been acting
kind of weird lately.

700
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,980
I mean, is something bothering her?

701
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,350
Well, I mean, her parents totally
don't sleep in the same bed anymore,

702
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,820
if that's what you mean.

703
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,320
Oh, my God.
Don't tell her I told you that.

704
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:20,400
I am beautiful in every single way

705
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,869
Yes, words can't bring me down

706
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,860
Yes, words can't bring me down

707
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,010
Don't you bring me down today

708
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,370
I mean, no offense,

709
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,210
but why would she send
you a candy cane?

710
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,850
She doesn't even
like you that much.

711
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,110
Maybe she feels weird around me

712
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,590
because I'm the only person
that knows about her nose job.

713
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,330
Oh, my God.
Pretend you didn't hear that.

714
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,260
Yo, yo, yo

715
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,330
All you sucker MCs
Ain't got nothing on me

716
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,530
From my grades to my lines
You can't touch Kevin G

717
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,860
I'm a Mathlete
So nerd is inferred

718
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,100
But forget what you heard
I'm like James Bond the Third

719
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,000
Shaken not stirred
I'm Kevin Gnapoor

720
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,900
The G is silent
when I sneak in your door

721
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,100
And make love to your woman
On the bathroom floor

722
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,370
I don't play it like Staggy
You'll know it was me

723
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,640
Because the next time you see her
She'll be like

724
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,750
- Kevin G!
- Thank you, Kevin, that's enough.

725
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,480
Happy holidays, everybody.

726
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,990
K.G. And the Power of Three.

727
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,630
That was something.

728
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,800
Does it bother you that they still
use your original choreography?

729
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,230
Shut up.

730
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,070
Damn.

731
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,900
- What?
- I'd rather see you out there

732
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,340
shaking that thing.

733
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,570
Gretchen, switch sides with Cady.

734
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,750
But I'm always on your left.

735
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,150
That was when there were three of us,
and now the tallest go in the middle.

736
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,510
But the whole dance
will be backwards.

737
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,250
I'm always on your left.

738
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,430
And right now you're getting
on my last nerve. Switch.

739
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,000
And finally,
please welcome to the stage

740
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,190
Santa's Helpers doing
"Jingle Bell Rock".

741
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,310
Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock

742
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,080
Jingle bells swing
And jingle bells ring

743
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,620
Snowing and blowing
Up bustels of fun

744
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,880
Now the jingle top has begun

745
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,500
Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock

746
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,360
Jingle bells chime
In jingle bell time

747
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,500
Dancing and prancing
In Jingle Bell Square

748
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,040
In the fr...

749
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,380
Jason?

750
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,820
What a brigth time
It's the rigth time

751
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,860
To rock the nigth away

752
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,260
Jingle bell time
Is a swell time

753
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,730
To go riding in a one-torse sleigh

754
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,380
Giddyap jingle torse
Pick up your feet

755
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,940
Jingle around the clock

756
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,780
Mix and mingle in a jingling beat

757
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,680
That's the jingle bell

758
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,380
That's the jingle bell

759
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,890
That's the jingle bell rock

760
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,870
That was the best it ever went!

761
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,130
- That was awesome.
- Lip gloss.

762
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,730
- Hey, good job, Africa.
- Thanks.

763
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,280
Cady's blushing. Oh, my God.

764
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,850
- You totally have a crush on that guy.
- No, I don't.

765
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,780
That's why you wanted
to join the Mathletes.

766
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,650
Mathletes? You hate math.

767
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,480
Look how red she is.

768
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,920
You love him. And he totally
complimented you.

769
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,750
That is so fetch.

770
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,490
Gretchen, stop trying
to make "fetch" happen.

771
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,160
It's not going to happen.

772
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,830
Why should Caesar get to stomp
around like a giant

773
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,970
while the rest of us try not to get
smushed under his big feet?

774
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,770
What's so great about Caesar?

775
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,640
Brutus is just as cute as Caesar.

776
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,470
OK, Brutus is just
as smart as Caesar.

777
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,050
People totally like Brutus just
as much as they like Caesar.

778
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,740
And when did it become
OK for one person

779
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,210
to be the boss of everybody?

780
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,890
Because that's not
what Rome is about!

781
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,890
We should totally just stab Caesar!"

782
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,920
Gretchen Wieners had cracked.

783
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,430
OK, if you even knew how mean
she really is.

784
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,030
You know that I'm not allowed
to wear hoop earrings, right?

785
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,370
Yeah. Two years ago, she told me
that hoop earrings were her thing

786
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,270
and that I wasn't allowed
to wear them anymore.

787
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,800
And then for my Hanukkah,
my parents got me this pair

788
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,780
of really expensive white-gold hoops.

789
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,880
And I had to pretend
like I didn't even like them,

790
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,550
and it was so sad.

791
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,740
And you know she cheats on Aaron?

792
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,150
Yes. Every Thursday he thinks
she's doing SAT prep.

793
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,090
But really, she's hooking up with
Shane Oman in the projection room

794
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,990
above the auditorium,

795
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,490
and I never told anybody that,
because...

796
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,160
...I'm such a good friend.

797
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,300
Jackpot. Gretchen's secret
had put the plan back in motion.

798
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,370
After Christmas break,
we tried every Thursday

799
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,700
to help Aaron catch Regina
in the act.

800
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,610
Hey.

801
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,300
Hey, what's up?

802
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,070
My purse!

803
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,580
Looks like he's headed
for the projection room

804
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,410
above the auditorium!

805
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,930
Coach Carr?

806
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,890
Trang Pak?

807
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,570
Guys, why did we think
we could do this? We're amateurs.

808
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:26,330
Guys, why did we think
we could do this? We're amateurs.

809
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,160
No, we just have to regroup.
Think outside our box.

810
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,000
What are Klteen bars?

811
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,110
They're these weird
Swedish nutrition bars.

812
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,250
My mom used to give them to the kids
in Africa to help them gain weight.

813
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,220
They're these weird nutrition bars
my mom uses to lose weight.

814
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,120
Give me it.

815
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,430
It's all in, like, Swedish or something.

816
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,060
Yeah, you know, there's some
weird ingredient in them

817
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,030
that's not legal in the U.S. yet.

818
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,130
- Ephedrine?
- No.

819
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,460
- Phentermine.
- No.

820
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,410
It burns carbs.
It just burns up all your carbs.

821
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,110
I really wanna lose 3 pounds.

822
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,810
Oh, my God,
what are you talking about?

823
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,280
You're so skinny.

824
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,850
Shut up.

825
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,240
The weird thing about
hanging out with Regina

826
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,220
was that I could hate her,
and at the same time,

827
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,750
I still wanted her to like me.

828
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,320
OK. You have really
good eyebrows.

829
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,150
- Thanks.
- Move.

830
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,090
Same with Gretchen.
The meaner Regina was to her,

831
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,460
the more Gretchen
tried to win Regina back.

832
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,070
Ste knew it was better to be
in The Plastics, hating life

833
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,930
than to not be in at all.

834
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,340
Because being with The Plastics
was like being famous.

835
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,140
People looked at you all the time,

836
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,610
and everybody
just knew stuff about you.

837
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,970
That new girl
moved here from Africa.

838
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,580
I saw Cady Heron wearing
Army pants and flip-flops,

839
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,340
so I bought Army pants
and flip-flops.

840
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,080
That Cady girl is hot.

841
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,260
She might even be hotter
than Regina George.

842
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,190
I hear Regina George
is dating Aaron Samuels again.

843
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,260
The two were seen canoodling
at Chris Eisel's Halloween party.

844
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,690
They've been inseparable ever since.

845
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,710
I was a woman possessed.

846
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,570
I spent about 80 percent
of my time talking about Regina.

847
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,110
And the other 20 percent
of the time,

848
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,010
I was praying for someone
else to bring her up

849
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,010
so I could talk about her more.

850
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,410
She's not even that good-looking
if you really look at her.

851
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,520
I don't know.
Now that's she's getting fatter,

852
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,160
she's got pretty big jugs.

853
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,950
I could hear people
getting bored with me.

854
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,600
But I couldn't stop. It just kept
coming up like word vomit.

855
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,330
I have this theory that if you cut all her
hair off, she'd look like a British man.

856
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,500
Yeah, I know.
You told me that one before.

857
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,300
Hey, I'm having an art show.

858
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,560
So why don't you take
a night off from your double life.

859
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,170
- I want you to see it.
- Coolness.

860
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,070
What is that smell?

861
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,110
Oh, Regina gave me some perfume.

862
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,210
You smell like a baby prostitute.

863
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,680
Thanks.

864
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:59,350
Meanwhile, I was finding any excuse
I could to talk to Aaron.

865
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,180
I don't get this.
Do you get any of this?

866
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,420
Nice job, Cady.

867
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,690
Kind of seems like you get it.

868
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,690
If I was gonna keep this going,
I was gonna have to really commit.

869
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,870
Not your best.

870
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,770
Damn, Africa, what happened?

871
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,670
- How'd you do?
- Not so good.

872
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,470
You know, I think I need a tutor.

873
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,150
I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get
together after school or something.

874
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,110
Do you think Regina would mind?

875
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,880
No. You guys are friends.

876
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,580
Well, maybe we just won't tell her.

877
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,320
So, what did you get for this one?

878
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,320
Well, the first time I did it,
I got a zero.

879
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,360
- Wrong.
- But then when I checked it, I got...

880
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,090
...one.
- There you go.

881
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,890
I got one too.

882
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,060
Yeah, you have to check it
because sometimes the product

883
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,760
of two negative integers
is a positive number.

884
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,440
Yeah, like negative four
and negative six.

885
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,770
That's right. That's good.

886
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,070
Well, you're a good tutor.

887
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,790
Man, look, I... I can't do this.

888
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,760
- It's not fair to Regina.
- Why do you like her?

889
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,660
Look, I know she can be really
mean sometimes, but...

890
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,770
- Then why do you like her?
- Why do you?

891
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,030
Look, there's good and bad
to everybody. Right?

892
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,930
Regina's just...

893
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,970
- She's just more up-front about it.
- Oh, no. It was coming up.

894
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,910
The word vomit.
I didn't mean to say it, but...

895
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,880
She's cheating on you!

896
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,480
What?

897
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,350
Did he say why?

898
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,460
Somebody told him
about Shane Oman.

899
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,360
Who?

900
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,050
He said some guy
on the baseball team.

901
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,390
Baseball team?

902
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,000
I gave him everything.
I was half a virgin when I met him.

903
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,730
You wanna do something fun?

904
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,130
You wanna go to Taco Bell?

905
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,670
I can't go to Taco Bell,
I'm on an all-carb diet.

906
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,710
God, Karen, you are so stupid!

907
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,400
Regina, wait. Talk to me.

908
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,710
- Nobody understands me.
- I understand you.

909
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,750
You're not stupid, Karen.

910
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,150
No. I am, actually.

911
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,550
I'm failing almost everything.

912
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,690
Well, there must be something
you're good at.

913
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,260
I can put my whole fist
in my mouth.

914
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,690
Wanna see?

915
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,730
No. That's OK.

916
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,200
Anything else?

917
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,040
I'm kind of psychic.

918
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,110
I have a fifth sense.

919
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,180
- What do you mean?
- It's like I have ESPN or something.

920
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,010
My breasts can always tell
when it's gonna rain.

921
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,040
Really? That's amazing.

922
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,920
Well, they can tell when it's raining.

923
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,760
I have to admit,
I was mildly horrified

924
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,260
when Aaron didn't immediately
ask me to be his girlfriend.

925
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,700
I mean, I know he was sad,
but how much time did he need?

926
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,390
Regina had moved on.

927
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,570
Do you guys need anything?
Some snacks?

928
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,470
A condom?

929
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,110
Let me know.
Oh, God love you.

930
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,040
But overall, the plan
was going pretty well.

931
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,380
Aaron had dumped Regina,
and she was unknowingly

932
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,250
eating 5,000 calories a day.

933
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,510
It was time to turn our attention
to the army of skanks.

934
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,929
And finally, the nominees for
Spring Fling Queen are as follows:

935
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,760
And finally, the nominees for
Spring Fling Queen are as follows:

936
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,320
Regina George.

937
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,890
Gretchen Wieners.

938
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,170
Janis Ian.

939
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,170
What is happening to the world?

940
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,310
And the final nominee...

941
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,000
I couldn't help myself.
It was so easy.

942
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,440
...is Cady Heron.

943
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,620
Damian, you put me in there too?
That's not part of the plan.

944
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,440
I didn't put you in there.

945
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,750
You mean I'm really nominated?

946
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,250
In January, Regina had put
a Spring Fling dress on hold

947
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,990
at a store called 1-3-5.

948
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,190
But being Plastic,
she needed our advice

949
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,630
before she could actually buy it.

950
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,530
Can someone zip me up?

951
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,960
- It won't close.
- It's a 5.

952
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,800
OK, it must be marked wrong.

953
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,880
Cady, all I've been eating are
these Klteen bars. They suck.

954
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,240
No, no, this is just how they work.

955
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,810
This is all your water weight.

956
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,640
First you bloat, and then you
drop 10 pounds like that:

957
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,750
Well, the Klteen bars
have burned up all your carbs,

958
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,680
and now your body's
just running on water.

959
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,950
But once the water's gone,
then you'll be all muscle.

960
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,860
It explains it all on the label.

961
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,490
You know Swedish?

962
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,320
Yeah, everyone in Africa
can read Swedish.

963
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,960
Ma'am, do you have this
in the next size up?

964
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:42,070
Sorry. We only carry
sizes 1, 3 and 5.

965
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,500
You could try Sears.

966
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,150
Cady.

967
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,410
I need your parents to sign this
so they know that you're failing.

968
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,320
Failing?

969
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,430
You know what's weird
about your quizzes, Cady,

970
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,390
is that all the work is right
and just the answers are wrong.

971
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,960
- Really?
- Really.

972
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,030
Cady, I know that having a boyfriend

973
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,070
may seem like the most important
thing in the world right now,

974
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,900
but you don't have to dumb yourself
down to get guys to like you.

975
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,700
- How would you know?
- I know,

976
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,880
"How would I know", right?

977
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,170
I'm divorced.
I'm broke from getting divorced.

978
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,410
The only guy that ever calls my house
is Randy from Chase Visa.

979
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,210
And you know why?

980
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,980
Because I'm a pusher.
I push people.

981
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,950
I pushed my husband into law school.
That was a bust.

982
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,420
I pushed myself
into working three jobs.

983
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,030
And now I'm gonna push you

984
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,130
because I know
you're smarter than this.

985
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,460
Thanks, Ms. Norbury.
And if there's anything I can do

986
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,030
for extra credit, please let me know.

987
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,600
Oh, I will.

988
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,540
I hate her! I mean, she's totally
failing me on purpose

989
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,370
because I didn't join
those stupid Mathletes!

990
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,800
She was so queer.

991
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,600
She was like, "I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."

992
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,910
What does that even mean?

993
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,110
- Like a drug pusher?
- Probably.

994
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,840
She said she works three jobs.

995
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,610
You know, I bet she sells drugs
on the side

996
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,050
to pay for her pathetic divorce.

997
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,120
You let it out, honey.

998
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,290
Put it in the book.

999
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,130
I know it may look
like I'd become a bitch,

1000
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,770
but that's only because
I was acting like a bitch.

1001
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,670
Hey, I called you last night.
How come you didn't call me back?

1002
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,810
Oh, I got busy. Sorry.

1003
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,500
So you need a ride to my art show
this weekend?

1004
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,310
No. I have to go to Madison
with my parents.

1005
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,040
I'm so sorry.

1006
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,840
Well, you wanna
watch a movie tonight?

1007
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,250
Can't. I'm doing major
Plastic sabotage tonight.

1008
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,980
But we don't have anything
planned for tonight.

1009
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,420
Oh, I planned this one on my own.

1010
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:43,850
Love you. Bye.

1011
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,060
Gretchen thinks you're mad at her

1012
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,890
because she's running
for Spring Fling Queen.

1013
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,160
Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her.
I'm worried about her.

1014
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,390
I think somebody nominated her
as a joke or something.

1015
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,670
And when nobody votes for her,
she's gonna have a total meltdown.

1016
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,170
And who's gonna have
to take care of her? Me.

1017
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,740
So you don't think
anyone will vote for her?

1018
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,710
Cady, she's not pretty.

1019
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,040
I mean, that sounds bad,
but whatever.

1020
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,310
The Spring Fling Queen
is always pretty.

1021
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,580
And the crazy thing is
is that it should be Karen,

1022
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,380
but people forget about her
because she's such a slut.

1023
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,620
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm going to bed.

1024
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:24,100
Well, she's not mad at you.

1025
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,930
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?

1026
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,270
- Hello?
- If someone said something bad

1027
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,170
about you, you'd want me
to tell you, right?

1028
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,810
- No.
- What if it was someone

1029
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,450
you thought was your friend?

1030
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,640
What are you...?
Hold on. Other line.

1031
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,850
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Good for you, Gretch.

1032
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,490
- Hello?
- Let's go out.

1033
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,780
OK. Hold on. I'm on the other
line with Gretchen.

1034
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,360
Don't invite Gretchen.
She's driving me nuts.

1035
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,190
- Hold on.
- OK, hurry up.

1036
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,530
It's Regina.

1037
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,500
She wants to hang out with me
tonight, but she told me not to tell you.

1038
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,330
Do not hang out with her.

1039
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,130
- Why?
- You don't want me to tell you.

1040
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,870
You can tell me. Hold on.

1041
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,940
Oh, my God,
she's so annoying.

1042
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,380
Who is?

1043
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,610
- Who's this?
- Gretchen.

1044
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,880
Right. Hold on.

1045
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,760
- Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
- I know. Just get rid of her.

1046
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,860
OK. What is it?

1047
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,960
Regina says everyone hates you
because you're such a slut.

1048
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,290
She said that?

1049
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,260
You didn't hear it from me.

1050
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,030
- Little harsh, Gretch.
- Whatever. She has a right to know.

1051
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,040
I can't go out.

1052
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,280
I'm sick.

1053
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,470
Boo. You whore.

1054
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,880
Regina,

1055
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,380
we have to talk to you.

1056
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:54,280
Is butter a carb?

1057
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,090
Yes.

1058
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:58,950
Regina, you're wearing sweatpants.

1059
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,390
It's Monday.

1060
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,190
- So?
- So that's against the rules

1061
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,890
and you can't sit with us.

1062
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,670
Whatever. Those rules aren't real.

1063
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,400
They were real
that day I wore a vest.

1064
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,600
- Because that vest was disgusting.
- You can't sit with us!

1065
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,280
These sweatpants are all
that fits me right now.

1066
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,220
Fine.

1067
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,420
You can walk home, bitches.

1068
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,230
Watch where you're going, fat-ass!

1069
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,370
Gretchen and Karen followed me
around all afternoon.

1070
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,810
- So, what are we doing this weekend?
- Yeah, what are we doing?

1071
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,670
Oh, I have to go to Madison
with my parents.

1072
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,840
What...?

1073
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,640
We have tickets for this thing.

1074
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,840
- What?
- What?

1075
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,350
Was I the new queen bee?

1076
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,990
I can try and get out of it.

1077
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,550
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1078
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,630
Because I told my friend Janis
I'd go to her art show.

1079
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,820
We've had these tickets for months.

1080
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,020
You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

1081
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,700
But she's my friend,
and I made her a promise.

1082
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,870
I think Cady's old enough
to spend one night on her own.

1083
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,510
I had learned how to control
everyone around me.

1084
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,310
Hey. I'm having a small get-together
at my house tomorrow night.

1085
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,510
- Is Regina going?
- No. Do you think I'm an idiot?

1086
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,210
No, it's just gonna be
a few cool people,

1087
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,860
and you better be
one of them, byotch.

1088
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,490
- Fine, I'll go.
- Shut up.

1089
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,680
I love that shirt on you.

1090
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,360
Aaron Samuels was going to be
in my touse at my party.

1091
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,400
Everything had to be perfect.

1092
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,570
And this time when Aaron saw me,

1093
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,340
I wouldn't be caught
in some ridiculous costume.

1094
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,240
Hey, guys.

1095
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,380
- You look awesome!
- You look awesome!

1096
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,020
I know, right?

1097
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,320
OK, so I got enough cheese
and crackers for eight people.

1098
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,250
Do you think that's enough?

1099
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,290
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1100
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,090
OK.

1101
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,130
It was not enough.

1102
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,900
Somehow, the word had gotten out
about my small get-together.

1103
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,130
Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.

1104
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,140
He's just using her
to make you mad.

1105
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,900
- Have you guys seen Aaron yet?
- No.

1106
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,440
Dude, put on
"The Ramayana Monkey Chant".

1107
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,350
- Do I know you?
- Deek! What up, dog?

1108
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,260
She thinks she's gonna have
a party and not invite me?

1109
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,340
- Who does she think she is?
- You're right, hon.

1110
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,030
I, like, invented her,
you know what I mean?

1111
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,120
Jason.

1112
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,810
I have to talk to you.

1113
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,460
Whatever.

1114
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,550
- I love you.
- I know, I know.

1115
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,130
Hey! Put that down!

1116
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,060
Was Aaron blowing me off?

1117
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,770
What's up?
Gretchen came to talk to me.

1118
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,680
- Oh, no.
- Look,

1119
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,320
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,
but I only date women of color.

1120
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,850
I have to pee.

1121
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,390
Get out.

1122
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,240
- Hey.
- Hey.

1123
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,780
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1124
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,280
Me too.

1125
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,360
You look...

1126
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,290
- New clothes?
- Thanks.

1127
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,930
You wanna go downstairs?

1128
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:03,460
No, no. Let's stay here.

1129
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,130
Thanks for getting me
to come out tonight.

1130
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,570
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1131
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:12,740
I wasted too much time
being pissed off at Regina.

1132
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,430
No more liars.

1133
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,470
I would never lie to you.

1134
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,440
I know, I know.

1135
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,050
Although...

1136
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,580
OK, listen.
I mean, I did lie to you once,

1137
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,910
but you're totally gonna laugh
when I tell you, so...

1138
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,750
Tell me what?

1139
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,920
I pretended to be bad at math
so that you'd help me.

1140
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,190
But the thing is,
I'm not really bad at math.

1141
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,330
I'm actually really good at math.
You're kind of bad at math.

1142
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,060
Anyways, now I'm failing.
Isn't that funny?

1143
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,900
Wait. You're failing on purpose?
That's stupid.

1144
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:45,770
No. Not on purpose.
Just, you know...

1145
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,530
I just wanted a reason to talk to you.

1146
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,370
So why didn't you just talk to me?

1147
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,510
Well, because I couldn't.
Because of Regina.

1148
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,270
Because you were her property...

1149
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,610
- Her property?
- No. Shut up. Not her property...

1150
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,310
No, don't tell me to shut up.

1151
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,180
- I wasn't...
- God, you know what?

1152
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,250
You are just like a clone of Regina.

1153
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,120
Oh, no, no, listen to me.
You're not listening to me...

1154
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,660
Oh, no. It was coming up again.
Word vomit. No, wait a minute...

1155
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,660
- What is this?!
- Actual vomit.

1156
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,400
Aaron!

1157
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,770
Aaron, wait! Just...

1158
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,770
OK. Call me.

1159
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,580
- Oh, God.
- You dirty little liar.

1160
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,620
I'm sorry. I can explain.

1161
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,050
Explain how you forgot
to invite us to your party?

1162
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,590
Janis, I cannot stop this car.
I have a curfew.

1163
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,690
You know I couldn't invite you.
I had to pretend to be Plastic.

1164
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,920
Hey, buddy, you're not
pretending anymore.

1165
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,100
You're Plastic.
Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.

1166
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,230
Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.

1167
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,130
Did you have an awesome time?

1168
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,470
Did you drink awesome shooters
and listen to awesome music,

1169
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,470
and then just sit around and soak up
each other's awesomeness?

1170
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,010
You're the one who made me like this

1171
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,550
so you could use me
for your eighth-grade revenge.

1172
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,580
God! See, at least me and
Regina George know we're mean.

1173
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:08,190
You try to act like you're so innocent.
Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa

1174
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,380
with all the little birdies
and the little monkeys."

1175
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,390
You know what? It's not my fault
you're in love with me or something!

1176
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,190
- What?!
- Oh, no she did not!

1177
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,560
See? That is the thing
with you Plastics.

1178
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:20,230
You think that everybody
is in love with you,

1179
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,560
when actually, everybody hates you.

1180
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,530
Like Aaron Samuels, for example.

1181
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,570
He broke up with Regina
and guess what.

1182
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,370
He still doesn't want you.

1183
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,740
So why are you still messing
with Regina, Cady? I'll tell you why.

1184
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:35,510
Because you are a mean girl!
You're a bitch!

1185
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,620
Here. You can have this.
It won a prize.

1186
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,290
And I want my pink shirt back!

1187
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,190
I want my pink shirt back!

1188
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,680
Hon, slow down.

1189
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,440
It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.

1190
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,050
Why are you eating a Klteen bar?

1191
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,650
- I'm starving.
- Man, I hate those things.

1192
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:14,290
Coach Carr makes us eat those when
we wanna move up a weight class.

1193
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,120
What?

1194
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:20,330
They make you gain weight like crazy.

1195
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,330
Mother...

1196
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:54,790
This girl is the nastiest skank bitch

1197
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,260
I've ever met.

1198
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:08,100
Do not trust her. She is a fugly slut!

1199
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:33,430
I found it in the girls' bathroom.
It's so mean, Mr. Duvall.

1200
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,930
Is this true?

1201
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,300
Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr?

1202
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,370
Good Lord.

1203
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,070
What's that say?
"Kaitlyn Caussin is a..."?

1204
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,940
Fat whore.

1205
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:51,140
OK, calm down, Miss George.

1206
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:55,310
Why would someone write that?
That's just so mean.

1207
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,120
Don't worry, we're gonna
find out who did it.

1208
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:00,890
There's only three girls
in the whole school who aren't in it.

1209
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,420
At your age, you're gonna
be having a lot of urges.

1210
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:07,830
You're gonna want to take off
your clothes and touch each other.

1211
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:12,570
But if you do touch each other,
you will get chlamydia. And die.

1212
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,170
Coach Carr.

1213
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:20,010
Cady Heron, they wanna see you
in the principal's office.

1214
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:26,710
All right, chlamydia. K-L-A...

1215
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,460
In here, Miss Heron.

1216
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,930
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Miss Heron.

1217
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,900
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

1218
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,780
I mean, yes, I've seen it before,
but it's not mine.

1219
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,680
You better get your story straight,
Miss Heron,

1220
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,650
because I'm not messing
around here.

1221
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,550
It's not ours, it's Regina's.

1222
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:01,480
Yeah, she's trying to make it look
like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.

1223
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:07,930
Miss Wieners, why would Regina
refer to herself as a "fugly slut"?

1224
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:13,230
Miss Smith, this is no time
to be laughing.

1225
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,630
We're gonna get to the bottom
of this right now.

1226
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,550
Maybe we're not in that book,
because everybody likes us.

1227
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,020
And I don't wanna be punished
for being well-liked.

1228
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,290
And I don't think my father,
the inventor of Toaster Strudel,

1229
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,470
would be too pleased
to hear about this.

1230
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,700
"Made out with a hot dog"?

1231
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,850
Oh, my God, that was one time!

1232
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:07,380
"Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"?
Who would write that?

1233
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,320
Who wouldn't write that?

1234
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,790
"Trang Pak made out
with Coach Carr"?

1235
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,550
And so did Sun Jin Dinh.

1236
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,410
Hey! Hey! Settle down!
All right, hey.

1237
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:28,510
No. You do not push and sh...

1238
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,020
Do you have anything else
you wanna say?

1239
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,560
No, I can't answer any
more questions

1240
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,420
until I have a parent
or lawyer present.

1241
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,890
Miss Smith?

1242
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:54,560
Whoever wrote it probably didn't
think anyone would ever see it?

1243
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,200
I hope that nobody else
ever does see it.

1244
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,210
Mom, can you pick me up?
I'm scared.

1245
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,720
- "Janis Ian, dyke"?
- That's original.

1246
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,690
- "Too gay to function"?!
- Hey!

1247
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,950
That's only OK when I say it.

1248
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,030
- Did you write this?
- No, I swear!

1249
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:24,890
- Then you told somebody!
- She told!

1250
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:28,190
- You little bitch!
- You're a bitch!

1251
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,240
Yeah! Take your top off!

1252
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,400
- Now, here's what we're gonna do...
- Ron, come quick!

1253
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:39,950
They've gone wild.
The girls have gone wild.

1254
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,290
It was full-tilt jungle madness.

1255
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,730
And it wasn't going away.

1256
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:05,800
Hey, I pulled these two off each other.

1257
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:08,810
Coach Carr, step away
from the underage girls.

1258
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,250
Let me help you down there.

1259
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,510
Hell, no! I did not leave
the Southside for this!

1260
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,490
Oh, crap! My hair!

1261
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:31,220
All junior girls report to the gymnasium
immediately! Immediately!

1262
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,800
Have you ever walked up to people

1263
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,300
and realized they were just
talking about you?

1264
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,570
Have you ever had it happen
60 times in a row?

1265
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,570
I have.

1266
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,040
Never in my 14 years as an educator
have I seen such behavior.

1267
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:13,240
And from young ladies.

1268
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:17,710
I got parents calling me on the phone
asking, "Did someone get shot?"

1269
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,950
I ought to cancel your Spring Fling.

1270
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,380
No!

1271
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:22,880
- No.
- What are we supposed to do?

1272
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,250
Now, I'm not gonna do that,
because we've already paid the DJ.

1273
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,720
But don't think that I'm not taking
this book seriously.

1274
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:33,030
Coach Carr has fled school property.

1275
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,030
Ms. Norbury has been
accused of selling drugs.

1276
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,730
Now, what the young ladies
in this grade need

1277
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,960
is an attitude makeover.

1278
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,740
And you're gonna get it right now.

1279
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:48,810
I don't care how long it takes,
I will keep you here all night.

1280
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,410
We can't keep them past 4.

1281
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,840
I will keep you here until 4.

1282
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,180
Now, what we're gonna try to do
is fix the way you young ladies

1283
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,880
relate to each other.

1284
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,650
OK? Lady to lady.

1285
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,850
So who has a lady problem
that they'd like to talk about?

1286
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,030
Yes?

1287
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:13,460
Somebody wrote in that book
that I'm lying about being a virgin

1288
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,690
because I use super-jumbo tampons.

1289
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,770
But I can't help it if I've got
a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.

1290
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:23,510
Yeah, I can't do this.

1291
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,140
Ms. Norbury.

1292
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:29,110
You're a successful, intelligent,
caring, graceful woman.

1293
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,650
I am?

1294
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,080
There has to be something
you can say to these young ladies.

1295
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:35,220
Something to help them
with their self-esteem?

1296
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:36,820
It's not a self-esteem problem.

1297
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:39,550
I think they're all pretty
pleased with themselves.

1298
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,990
OK.

1299
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:48,260
OK. Everybody close your eyes.

1300
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,200
I want you to raise your hand
if you have ever had a girl

1301
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,540
say something bad
about you behind your back.

1302
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,440
Open your eyes.

1303
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,670
Now, close your eyes again.

1304
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,680
And this time, I want you to raise
your hand if you have ever

1305
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,450
said anything about a friend
behind her back.

1306
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,130
Open them.

1307
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,200
There's been some
girl-on-girl crime here.

1308
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:28,000
OK. So, what we could do today
is a couple exercises to help you

1309
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:31,110
express your anger in a healthy way.

1310
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:33,340
Let's start over here.

1311
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,350
Ms. Norbury had us confront
each other directly

1312
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,020
about the things
that were bothering us.

1313
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,240
And it seemed like every clique
had its own problems.

1314
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:42,360
You've been acting really stuck-up
ever since you switched to shortfielder.

1315
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,320
And Dawn agrees with me.

1316
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,150
- Dawn?
- Don't drag me into this,

1317
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,660
I'm pitching tomorrow.

1318
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,530
OK. Good.

1319
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:01,410
Can I just say that we don't have
a clique problem at this school?

1320
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:04,340
And some of us shouldn't have to take
this workshop, because some of us

1321
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,640
are just victims in this situation.

1322
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:08,980
That's probably true.
How many of you

1323
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,980
have ever felt personally
victimized by Regina George?

1324
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:25,360
Good. OK, who's next?

1325
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:27,090
Who's next?

1326
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:30,700
Cady.

1327
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,600
Do you have anything
you wanna own up to?

1328
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,040
Yes.
No.

1329
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,110
You never made up a rumor
about anybody?

1330
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:39,740
Just that you sell drugs.

1331
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:41,180
No.

1332
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,850
Nothing you want to apologize for?

1333
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,690
I couldn't apologize to Ms. Norbury

1334
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,910
without getting blamed
for the whole Burn Book.

1335
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,620
No.

1336
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,120
I'm really disappointed in you, Cady.

1337
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,520
OK, so we're all here
because of this book, right?

1338
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,560
Well, I don't know
who wrote this book,

1339
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:05,540
but you all have got to stop
calling each other sluts and whores.

1340
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,710
It just makes it OK for guys
to call you sluts and whores.

1341
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,470
Who here has ever been called a slut?

1342
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,240
OK, everybody up.

1343
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:18,980
Ms. Norbury had us
write out apologies

1344
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,350
to people that we'd hurt in our lives.

1345
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:25,220
"Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you
a gap-toothed bitch."

1346
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:27,950
"It's not your fault
you're so gap-toothed."

1347
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,870
"Gretchen,

1348
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:36,500
"I'm sorry I laughed
at you that time you got diarrhea"

1349
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:38,330
"at Barnes and Noble."

1350
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,440
"And I'm sorry I told everyone about it."

1351
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,430
And I'm sorry for repeating it now.

1352
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,210
Laura, I don't hate you
because you're fat.

1353
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,750
You're fat because I hate you.

1354
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,420
I just wish we could all get along
like we used to in middle school.

1355
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:04,570
I wish that I could bake a cake
made out of rainbows and smiles,

1356
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,670
and we'd all eat it and be happy.

1357
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,500
She doesn't even go here!

1358
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,460
Do you even go to this school?

1359
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:16,340
No. I just have a lot of feelings.

1360
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,110
OK, go home.

1361
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,710
Sharon, I think you're doing
a great job.

1362
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,510
Thanks. I feel like I'm getting through.

1363
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,120
I'm sorry that people
are so jealous of me.

1364
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,420
But I can't help it that I'm popular.

1365
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,490
Oh, my God! Oh, jeez.
OK, walk it off. Walk it off.

1366
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,860
OK. That hurt.

1367
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,000
They're OK.

1368
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,230
They're OK.

1369
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:52,040
Oh, boy. OK, who's next?
Who's next? Keep it going.

1370
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,690
Oh, my God. It's her dream come true,
diving into a big pile of girls.

1371
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,190
OK, yeah, I've got an apology.

1372
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,830
So I have this friend
who is a new student this year.

1373
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:15,090
And I convinced her that it would be
fun to mess up Regina George's life.

1374
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,790
So I had her pretend
to be friends with Regina,

1375
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,530
and then she would come
to my house after

1376
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:22,440
and we would just laugh about
all the dumb stuff Regina said.

1377
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,170
And we gave her
these candy bar things

1378
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:26,010
that would make her gain weight,

1379
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:28,410
and we turned her best friends
against her.

1380
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,850
And then... Oh, yeah, Cady...
You know my friend Cady.

1381
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,850
She made out
with Regina's boyfriend

1382
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,150
and then convinced him
to break up with her.

1383
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,990
Oh, God, and we gave you foot cream
instead of face wash.

1384
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,820
God! I am so sorry, Regina.

1385
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,960
Really, I don't know why I did it.

1386
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:49,400
I guess it's probably because
I've got a big lesbian crush on you.

1387
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,300
Suck on that!

1388
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:56,280
Janis! Janis! Janis! Janis!

1389
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,310
Regina!

1390
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,720
Regina, wait! I didn't mean
for that to happen.

1391
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,910
To find out that everyone hates me?
I don't care.

1392
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,120
Regina, please! Regina, stop!

1393
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,990
No! Do you know
what everyone says about you?

1394
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,130
They say that you're
a home-schooled jungle freak,

1395
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:19,160
who's a less-hot version of me.

1396
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:22,130
Yeah. So don't try to act so innocent.

1397
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:25,600
You can take that fake apology
and shove it right up your hairy...

1398
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:31,940
And that's how Regina George died.

1399
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:35,210
No, I'm totally kidding.
But she did get hurt.

1400
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,680
Some girls say they saw her head
go all the way around.

1401
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:40,680
But that's just a rumor.
Some people swear they saw me

1402
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,080
push her in front of the bus.
That was an even worse rumor.

1403
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:48,680
- Everybody done?
- No. Mom, I didn't do it.

1404
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,660
I don't know what to believe anymore.

1405
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,960
Mom, believe me.
I'm your daughter.

1406
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,830
Why are my tribal vases
under the sink?

1407
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,130
My tribal vases.
Why were they under the sink?

1408
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,040
I don't know.

1409
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,640
This is the fertility vase
of the Ndebele tribe.

1410
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:09,870
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

1411
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,510
Who are you?

1412
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,850
Great. All my friends hate me,
and now my mom hates me.

1413
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,960
Your mom does not hate you.

1414
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,820
She's afraid of you.

1415
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:30,860
I don't know, maybe we
mainstream-schooled you too soon.

1416
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:34,940
Maybe you should come back and
be home-schooled again for a while.

1417
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:39,330
No. Only thing worse than
going back will be not going back.

1418
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,300
How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?

1419
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:45,610
Remember when we saw those lions
fighting over the wart hog carcass?

1420
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,750
I'll be the wart hog.

1421
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,720
You're not a wart hog,

1422
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,680
you're a lion.

1423
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,620
Just focus on your studies
for a little while.

1424
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,290
You're still an excellent student, right?

1425
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,930
Oh, yeah. I need you to sign
my calculus test.

1426
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,490
- Why?
- I'm failing.

1427
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,570
OK. You are...

1428
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,380
What do they call it?

1429
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,910
Grounded.

1430
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,970
You're grounded.

1431
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,230
She pushed her in front of the bus.

1432
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,570
Did you see her do it?

1433
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,110
Yes.

1434
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,560
Did your teacher ever try to sell you
marijuana or Ecstasy tablets?

1435
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:11,200
- No.
- What are marijuana tablets?

1436
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,300
What's going on?
Where's Ms. Norbury?

1437
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:17,730
Mr. Duvall, this is ridiculous.
Ms. Norbury does not sell drugs.

1438
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:21,140
I know, Aaron. But after
the allegations against Coach Carr

1439
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:23,610
turned out to be extremely true,

1440
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:27,050
the school board felt that it was best
that we investigate every claim made

1441
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,480
in this Burn Book.

1442
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,920
That book was written
by a bunch of stupid girls

1443
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,990
who make up rumors
because they're bored

1444
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,950
with their own lame lives.

1445
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,920
Well, unless someone wants to come
forward and say, "I made it all up",

1446
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,720
this is how we have to handle it.
To say that someone...

1447
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:45,600
Oh, no. Bye, Aaron.
You're gonna hate me forever.

1448
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,530
Mr. Duvall.

1449
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,970
I wrote it.

1450
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,110
Come on, Cady.

1451
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:02,880
When you get bit by a snake,

1452
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,950
you're supposed to suck
the poison out.

1453
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,960
That's what I had to do.
Suck all the poison out of my life.

1454
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,220
I started with Regina,

1455
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,690
who was living proof that the more
people are scared of you,

1456
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,200
the more flowers you get.

1457
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,630
Then there was Ms. Norbury,

1458
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,400
who was living proof that no
good deed goes unpunished.

1459
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:24,560
Oh, hi. Did you wanna
buy some drugs?

1460
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:28,740
- I'm just done with my quiz.
- Wait. I'll grade it right now.

1461
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,510
I gotta say, watching the police
search my house

1462
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,210
really was the cherry on top
of a fantastic year.

1463
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:42,980
How much trouble did you get in
for telling the truth?

1464
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,490
A lot.

1465
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,350
You didn't write that whole book
yourself.

1466
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,190
Did you tell Mr. Duvall who else did it?

1467
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,260
No, because I'm trying
this new thing

1468
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,660
where I don't talk about people
behind their backs.

1469
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,100
That's all right. Gething hit by a bus
is pretty good punishment.

1470
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,570
Ninety-four.

1471
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,500
Welcome back, nerd.

1472
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:01,270
Thanks.

1473
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:03,780
Anyway...

1474
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,250
...I'm sorry.

1475
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,780
I forgive you.

1476
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:10,420
But as my own personal
form of punishment,

1477
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,020
I figured out how you're gonna
earn that extra credit.

1478
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:15,960
What's up?

1479
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:17,450
Excellent. Great turnout this year.

1480
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,700
- All right. It's all you.
- OK.

1481
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,660
- Make me look good out there.
- OK.

1482
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:32,170
Marymount, you sons of bitches.
You no-good sons of bitches.

1483
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,600
- You nervous?
- Yes.

1484
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:38,170
Don't be. You can do this.
There's nothing to break your focus,

1485
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,970
because not one of those
Marymount boys is cute.

1486
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,180
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1487
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:47,010
Welcome to the Illinois High School
Mathletes State Championship.

1488
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:50,150
Let's start the competition.
Here is the first question.

1489
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:53,720
Twice the larger of two numbers
is three more than five times

1490
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,830
the smaller, and the sum
of four times the larger

1491
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:59,260
and three times the smaller is 71.
What are...?

1492
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,560
- North Shore?
- Fourteen and five.

1493
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,320
That is correct.
Question number two.

1494
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:06,630
Find an odd three-digit number
whose digits add up to 12.

1495
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,900
The digits are all different, and the
difference between the first two digits

1496
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,440
equals the difference between...

1497
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,470
- Marymount?
- 741.

1498
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,010
- Correct.
- Shoot. I was really rusty.

1499
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,540
- Where's Cady?
- She went out.

1500
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,150
She's grounded.

1501
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,980
Are they not allowed out
when they're grounded?

1502
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:35,190
Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling
King and Queen, people.

1503
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,230
These A-holes will represent you
for a full calendar year.

1504
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,700
I'm gonna vote for Regina George
because she got hit by that bus.

1505
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:45,000
I'm voting for Cady Heron
because she pushed her.

1506
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,580
She's supposed to be grounded,
but he let her out.

1507
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:00,620
After 87 minutes of very
competitive play, we have a tie.

1508
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:04,060
In the event of a tie, we move
into a sudden-death round.

1509
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:07,790
Each team is given the opportunity
to choose their opponent.

1510
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,970
- North Shore, who do you select?
- The girl, dude. The girl.

1511
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:13,600
Contestant Krafft.

1512
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,040
From Marymount,
Miss Caroline Krafft.

1513
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,710
We pick the girl too.

1514
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:24,240
And from North Shore,
Miss Cady Heron.

1515
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,180
It's Cady.

1516
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,110
Oh, my God, that's me.

1517
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,520
Miss Caroline Krafft seriously
needed to pluck her eyebrows.

1518
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:44,060
Her outfit looked like it was picked out
by a blind Sunday school teacher.

1519
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:47,140
And she had some 99-cent
lip gloss on her snaggletooth.

1520
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:50,510
And that's when I realized,
making fun of Caroline Krafft

1521
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,270
wouldn't stop her
from beating me in this contest.

1522
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:56,940
Contestants,
find the limit of this equation.

1523
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,180
Calling somebody else fat
won't make you any skinnier.

1524
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,720
Calling someone stupid
doesn't make you any smarter.

1525
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,380
And ruining Regina George's life
definitely didn't make me any happier.

1526
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:10,030
All you can do in life is try to solve
the problem in front of you.

1527
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,860
- The limit is negative one.
- Oh, crap. I lost.

1528
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:15,690
That answer is incorrect.

1529
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,470
Now, we are in a sudden death.
If Miss Heron can answer

1530
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:22,700
this problem correctly,
we have a winner.

1531
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,640
Limits. Why couldn't I remember
anything about limits?

1532
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,330
Limits. That was the week
Aaron got his hair cut.

1533
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:30,950
Oh, God, he looked so cute.
OK, focus, Cady.

1534
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:33,480
What was on the board
behind Aaron's head?

1535
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,910
If the limit never approaches
anything...

1536
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,150
The limit does not exist.

1537
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,690
The limit does not exist!

1538
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,860
Our new state champions,

1539
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,150
- the North Shore Mathletes.
- Yeah!

1540
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:56,370
How do you like me now?

1541
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:00,370
You like that? Yeah!
Get some! Get some!

1542
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,970
Awesome. You went
with the leather sleeves.

1543
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:05,270
- Africa, you did the damn thing.
- Thanks.

1544
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,120
Thanks, K.G.

1545
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,550
We're gonna look so kick-ass
in these when we roll into Spring Fling.

1546
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,420
- Oh, no, I'm not going.
- What?

1547
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,320
Cady, this is your night.
Don't let the haters

1548
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,860
stop you from doing your thang.

1549
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,890
Did you just say "thang"?

1550
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,860
Cady, you don't have to punish
yourself forever.

1551
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:22,960
But I'm grounded.

1552
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:24,860
You're already out.

1553
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,810
All right, do we have all
of our nominees

1554
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,850
for king and queen on the stage?

1555
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,790
OK, good. I just wanted to say
that you're all winners.

1556
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,890
And I could not be happier
that this school year's ending.

1557
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:55,790
Here we go. The winner
of the Spring Fling King,

1558
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:59,000
- Shane Oman.
- Yes!

1559
01:26:59,370 --> 01:27:01,270
That's what I'm talking about!

1560
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,200
And your Spring Fling Queen,

1561
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,870
future co-chair
of the Student Activities Board

1562
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,050
and winner of two gift certificates

1563
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:14,240
to the Walker Brothers
Pancake House,

1564
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,980
Cady Heron.

1565
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,460
Where is Cady?

1566
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,960
There she is.

1567
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:44,200
Thanks.

1568
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,680
Well, half the people in this room
are mad at me.

1569
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:51,790
And the other half only like me

1570
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:55,190
because they think I pushed
somebody in front of a bus.

1571
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:57,590
So that's not good.

1572
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,720
You know, it's not really required
of you to make a speech.

1573
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:02,870
I'm almost done, I swear.

1574
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:08,640
To all the people whose feelings
that got hurt by the Burn Book,

1575
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:10,940
I'm really sorry.

1576
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:15,340
You know, I've never been
to one of these things before.

1577
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:18,880
And when I think about
how many people wanted this

1578
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:21,940
and how many people
cried over it and stuff...

1579
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:27,590
I mean, I think everybody
looks like royalty tonight.

1580
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:31,820
Look at Jessica Lopez.
That dress is amazing.

1581
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:34,830
And Emma Gerber, I mean,
that hairdo must have taken hours,

1582
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,360
and you look really pretty.

1583
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,540
So...

1584
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,770
...why is everybody stressing
over this thing?

1585
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:48,270
I mean, it's just plastic.
Could really just...

1586
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,580
Share it.

1587
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,290
A piece for Gretchen Wieners,
a partial Spring Fling Queen.

1588
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:01,990
A piece for Janis Ian.

1589
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:06,220
Seriously, most people
just take the crown and go.

1590
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,460
And a piece for Regina George.

1591
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:11,500
She fractured her spine,
and she still looks like a rock star.

1592
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:15,200
Thank you.

1593
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,840
And some for everybody else.

1594
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,510
God, Mr. Duvall, can you wrap it up?

1595
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:31,650
Thanks.

1596
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:34,820
All right, have a good time, everyone.

1597
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:43,300
Look. I'm a queen.

1598
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,060
As am I.

1599
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,630
- Hey.
- Hey.

1600
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,330
So are we still in a fight?

1601
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:52,630
Are you still an asshole?

1602
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,070
I don't think so.

1603
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,270
Well, then I guess we're OK.

1604
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:58,450
Oh, my God, I love this song!

1605
01:29:58,650 --> 01:29:59,780
I hate this song.

1606
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:01,820
I know this song!

1607
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:05,220
Man candy, stage right.

1608
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:10,790
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey. Didn't think you'd make it.

1609
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:16,330
On behalf of the senior class, I'd like to
present you with two gift certificates...

1610
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:18,230
- Thanks, sucker.
- Yo, peace.

1611
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:23,240
One gift certificate to
the Walker Brothers Pancake House.

1612
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:25,470
Thank you.

1613
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:31,880
Congratulations on winning State.

1614
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:34,680
I was so nervous.
They made us do limits.

1615
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,610
I thought I was gonna hurl.

1616
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,080
- How's your stomach now?
- It's fine.

1617
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:42,120
- Do you feel nauseous at all?
- No.

1618
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:44,060
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

1619
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:45,890
OK.

1620
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,320
Grool.

1621
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:13,950
No.

1622
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:18,520
- What's up?
- Can I help you?

1623
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,630
You Puerto Rican?

1624
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:22,390
Lebanese.

1625
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,120
I feel that.

1626
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,110
In case you're wondering,
The Plastics broke up.

1627
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,410
Regina's spine healed,
and her physical therapist

1628
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:46,920
taught her to channel
all her rage into sports.

1629
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,590
It was perfect because
the jock girls weren't afraid of her.

1630
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:02,430
Karen used her special talents to do
the morning weather announcements.

1631
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,040
Hi. This is Karen Smith.
It's 68 degrees,

1632
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:10,480
and there's a 30 percent chance
that it's already raining.

1633
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:13,180
And Gretchen found herself
a new clique

1634
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,050
and a new queen bee to serve.

1635
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:23,290
Aaron went to Northwestern,
so I still get to see him on weekends.

1636
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:24,460
And me?

1637
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:27,320
I had gone from home-schooled
jungle freak to shiny Plastic

1638
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:30,630
to most hated person in the world
to actual human being.

1639
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:32,060
Hey.

1640
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,300
All the drama from last year
just wasn't important anymore.

1641
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,310
School used to be like a shark tank,
but now I could just float.

1642
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:41,740
Regina.

1643
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,470
Finally, Girl World was at peace.

1644
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:50,610
Hey, check it out. Junior Plastics.

1645
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:54,190
And if any freshmen
tried to disturb that peace...

1646
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:57,380
Well, let's just say we knew
how to take care of it.

1647
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:04,960
Just kidding.
