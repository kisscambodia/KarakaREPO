198

Not at the table.

Thank you.

Are you Rusty's mom?

204

I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know her.

I tried to tell him,

213
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,125
she ain't out there,
but he's stubborn as hell.

214
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,905
How do you guys know each other?

215
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,795
- We don't.
- He's taking me to Colorado.

216

How old are you, Gus?

217
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,343
I'm ten, I think.

218
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,554
Isn't that old for one of them?

219
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,637
How old's Rusty?

220
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,015
He's 11.

221
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,975
He's one of the last, uh...

227
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,031

they used to send people to the moon?

My dad said they used to make people
go to outer space and stuff.

237

Have you ever been to the moon?

238
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,293
No. I went to a mall one time.

No.

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,689
I had a golden retriever named Snickers,

245
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,567

253

It's like a caterpillar, and it goes fast.

254
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,342
So how do I play it?

255
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,886

355
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,368
Hey.

356
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,953
I love you.

357
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,456
I love you.

358
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,754
Ooh.

359
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,218
[grunts, exhales]

360
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,135
[sighs]

361
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,472
You ready for a ride, Trixie?

362
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,035
- Hey? [smooches]
- [Trixie nickering]

363
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,099
Come on.

364
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,769
[repetitive acoustic guitar music playing]

365
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,040
[whistling]

366
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,422
- Hey, Adi.
- [Dr. Singh] Hey, Bob.

367
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,843
[gate buzzes, creaks open]

368
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,764
- You two stay safe out there.
- Yeah, we will.

369
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,891
You're a good man, Bob.

370
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,601
[door alarm beeping]

371
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,534
[clears throat]

372
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,618
How are you?

373
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,121
Where's Kevin?

374
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,457
Oh, split a few days ago.

375
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,710
He heard they were starting
new safe zones on the east coast.

376
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,421
Didn't know there was
an east coast anymore. [snickers]

377
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,508
Between the two of us,
Kevin was getting suburban cabin fever,

378
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,843
so he'd use any excuse to get out of here.

379
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,638
Are you feeling okay?

380
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,390
Yeah, yeah, just a routine checkup.

381
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,977
You know,
it's easy to lose track of the days.

382
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,104
- Don't I know it. Wrist, please.
- Yeah, sorry.

383
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,357
[machine buzzing]

384
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,901
[beeping]

385
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,486
All good. Take a seat.

386
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,569
Thanks.

387
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,078
[distant coughing]

388
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,753

[radio interference]

[box clattering]

[ominous music building]

393
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,352
[receptionist]
Thank you. See you next week.

394
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,669
- [receptionist] Mr. Singh?
- Yes.

395
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,361
The doctor will see you now.

396
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,249
[Dr. Singh] Busy as usual tonight?

397
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,458
Refill?

398
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,087
Yeah. Thanks.

399
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,676
How long have the doses been lasting?

400
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,805
Um, about 28 days
she's in full remission, and then...

401
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,473
And then the Sick comes back?

402
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,392
Yeah.

403
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,186
Any symptoms with this new cocktail?

404
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,148
A small rash on her leg, slight nausea,

405
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,816
but, uh, her energy levels are up.

406
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,651
Must be inching closer to a cure.

407
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,906
It's funny, you've been saying
the same thing for the past ten years,

408
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,785
and I still can't tell if you're
talking to me as a relative of a patient

409
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,869
or as a colleague.

410
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,750
What's this?

411
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,917
All my records.

412
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:12,422
Detailed documentation
of every trial version I've used on Rani,

413
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,424
what has worked and what hasn't.

414
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,094
You want me to help keep track?
You know my medical days are over.

415
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,888
They don't have to be.

416
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,514
[ominous music playing]

417
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,478
I prefer it on the sidelines, you know,
less screaming and mass death.

418
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,606
- You know what I went through.
- What we all went through.

419
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,194
I wouldn't be asking you
if I had any other choice.

420
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,449
What aren't you saying, Gladys?

421
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,161
Before everything happened...

422
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:48,958
I used to preach to all my patients that
mammograms have saved countless women.

423
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,502
But since the virus hit,

424
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,464
cancer has been a secondary concern.

425
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,782
The thought of something inside you

426
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,260
and taking you down slowly
seems like a luxury.

427
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,932
How far along are you?

428
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,394
I'm pretty sure it's stage four now.

429
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,312
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

430
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,564
I don't know what to say.

431
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,733
Say you'll continue the work I started.

432
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,568
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

433
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,613
That is what the book is for.

434
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,826
Now, I've had to do
a lot of things that I'm not proud of.

435
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,914
But you, of all people, know that
this new world is all about survival,

436
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,874
no matter the cost.

437
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,958
[sighs]

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,962
Rani is alive today because of you,

439
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,215
and, um, we're both forever grateful...

440
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,050
You know, there was a time

441
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,430
when I was convinced my purpose
was to find the cure to the virus,

442
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,432
but now I know I was wrong.

443
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,184
It's yours.

444
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,272
How can you be so sure?

445
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:56,067
Because there's nothing that
you wouldn't do for your wife, Dr. Singh.

446
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,821
And that is exactly
what it's going to take.

447
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,825
[thunder rumbling]

448
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,620
[Dr. Singh exhales]

449
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,710
What's wrong?

450
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,507
Did she run out of medicine again?

451
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,593
No, she's... she's gone.

452
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,262
I don't understand.

453
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,225
She's left instructions.
It's up to me now to make your medicine.

454
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,228
[Rani exhales]

[ominous music playing]

456
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,940
You're acting like this is a bad thing.

457
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,570
I can't think of anything better than
my own husband keeping me healthy.

458
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,823
- My personal hero...
- No, you don't understand what she's been...

459
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,743
What she's been doing. It's...

460
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,828
[exhales]

461
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,330
[Rani] What is it, Adi?

462
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,878
It goes against
everything that we believe in.

463
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,425
I don't think I can do it.

464
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,801
- [music builds]
- [Rani inhales sharply]

465
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,885
[exhales sharply]

[sighs]

467
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,534
MRE tokens.

468
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,661
You can trade them in for military food.

469
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,039
I'm only taking what I need
to get back to the Market.

470
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,250
We don't want your money.

471
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,919
I'd offer you meds, but he lost all mine.

472
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,132
- What are you doing with him?
- Trying to get rid of him.

473
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,301
Easier said than done.

474
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,678
You're one of them,

475
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,761
aren't you?

476
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,056
I, uh...

477
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,642
saw your mark.

478
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,686
Not anymore.

479
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,188
How many people have you killed?

480
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,691
- Can we not do this?
- Did they all deserve it?

481
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,111
Did you come here for my family?

482
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,697
My son?

483
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,449
I came here for food.

484
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,993
Look, lady,

485
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,163
I did what I had to, to survive.

486
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,540
Just like everyone else.

487
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,628
We never stole.

488
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,880
Or kidnapped.

489
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,590
And we never killed anyone.

490
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:10,053
That's because people like you
had people like me to do it for you.

491
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,307
He believes you're gonna look after him.

492
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,476
He believes whatever the hell he wants.

493
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,478
If it were up to me...

494
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,649
there'd be no such thing as kids like him.

495
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,108
Then why did you save him?

496
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,235
Doesn't matter.

497
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,616
I got an idea.

498
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,994
[somber music playing]

499
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,537
Why don't you take him?

500
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,417
I saved him, you keep him.
He's better off here than out there.

501
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,628
What about his mom?

502
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,673
You're the closest thing
he'll ever have to a mom.

503
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,060
I have to... talk to George.

504
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,312
Good. Tell him you're out of beans.

505
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,359
[thunder rumbling]

506
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,284
Have you met kids like me before?

507
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,789
This one time,
we saw a bobcat girl in the woods,

508
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,333
but she didn't talk like you.

509
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,460
My dad scared her off.

510
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,211
Why?

511
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,631
He said 'cause it's animal kids' fault.

512
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,425
What is?

513
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,302
Making everyone get sick and die.

514
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,642
Hey, my Pubba wrote that.

515
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,145
[Rusty] Who?

516
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,814
My Pubba, he wrote lots of books.

517
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,444
That's not what
<i>The Velveteen Rabbit </i>looks like.

518
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,321
[chuckles] Who drew this?

519
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,366
His eyes are crazy.

520
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,870
He looks like he's got boogers.

521
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,585
[melancholic music playing]

522
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,760
Have you seen any fires?

523
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,137
What?

524
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,687
Outside,
there's supposed to be fires everywhere.

525
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,133
[Rusty] You're weird, Sweet Tooth.

526
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,691
Super weird.

527
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,028
[Bev] Boys, bed time.

528
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,623
What's it like having a mom?

529
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,125
It's cool, I guess.

530
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,420
It's like having a dad...

531
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,047
