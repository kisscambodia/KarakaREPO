183
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,036
Did you know that before the virus came,
the water wasn't blue?

184
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,540
That's because
they filled the water with trash.

185
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,125
The sky too.

186
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,629
But once kids like <i>you</i> were born,

187
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,173
the Earth could start to heal.

188
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,635
You can live without taking.

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,429
You can keep the Earth alive.

190
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,181
And that's why we vowed

191
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,059
to always protect hybrids,
no matter what the cost.

192
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,063
- [soldier 2] That's right.
- [soldier 3] Always.

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,482
Is that why no grownups live here?

By Last Men.

197
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,661
And that's 'cause
they had no one to protect them.

198
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,705
But now,

199
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
we can protect ourselves.

200
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,214
I have one last
very important question for you, Gus.

201
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,177
Do you know how to drive?

202

[soldier] Watch out!

204
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,150
I'm not sure how much longer
we can hold him.

205
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,944
You've seen how big he is, right?

206
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,362
We've dealt with worse.

207
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,324
I don't get
why we can't just kill him now.

208
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,950
I've got Daisy all ready to go.

209
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,160
[Bear] This is different.

210
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,871
We've never had a hybrid
protect their poacher before.

211
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,707
Aren't you curious why?

212
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,791
No!

213
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,252
And you shouldn't be either.

214
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,463
He has the brand.

215
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,674
Do I need to remind you who's in charge?

00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,253
Pubba could have made
hundreds of books here.

218
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,631
What's your book gonna be about?

219
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,844
My adventures with Jepp, to find my mom.

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,138
You're trying to find your mom?

221
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,850
Yeah. Is that okay?

222
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,398
Jepp's taking me to Colorado
because that's where she is.

223
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,149
Do you know her? Her name is Birdie.

224
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,942
Birdie?

225
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,446
What a fitting name for your mom.

226
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,324
Sorry, I don't know her.

227
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,830
But we can maybe find out more.

228
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,206
We can?

229
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,273
[whispering] Let's keep this a secret
between you and me, okay?

230

Find out everything you can,
Birdie in Colorado.

231
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,766
Is it like this here all the time?

232
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,561
Would you like to stay?

233
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,442
Well, maybe I can come back and visit
after Jepp and I find my mom.

234
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,487
Can I ask you something?

235
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,158
If Jepp was supposed
to take you to Colorado,

236
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,076
why aren't you there right now?

237
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,538
Because we got caught
by the bad men, remember?

238
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,040
Before you guys came.

239
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,753
Was Jepp upset
that you guys missed the train?

Well, he wasn't coming with.

241
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,673
It was just me.

242
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,177
So you were gonna
have to go on the train alone?

243
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
[Gus] Yeah.

244
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,097
Seems kind of scary.

245
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,725
Yeah, but I've been alone before.

I can do it.

How long were you alone for?

I don't know.

When I lost my family, I was alone too.

00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,256
I was pretty scared.

256
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,091
And lonely.

257
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,097
Sometimes, I'd get so excited
just to see another person,

258
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,225
that I'd forget that they could be bad.

259
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,645
I just wanted a friend.

260

Any friend.

00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,234
- Jepp is my friend.
- Has he said he's your friend?

00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,237
No, but he doesn't need to.

Do you want to know the truth?

264
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,455
He's one of the bad people
your father told you about.

He's a Last Man,

266

the same men who caught you at the Market.

The same men who killed my family.

268
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,592
There's only one reason they'd keep
a hybrid around. It's not to be friends.

The Last Men have made it
their mission to eliminate hybrids.

But we've made it ours to protect them.
