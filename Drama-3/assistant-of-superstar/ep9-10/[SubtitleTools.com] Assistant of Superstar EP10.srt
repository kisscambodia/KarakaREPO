192
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,960
Mom.

193
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,630
If I hadn't asked my mom

194
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,870
to deliver my speech draft,

195
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
she'd be all right.

196
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,080
It's all my fault. My fault.

197
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,550
My...

198
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,840
It's all right.

199
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,390
It's all right.

200
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,790
It's all in the past now.

201
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:22,960
Actually...

202
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,480
I actually haven't finished my words

203
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,030
at the birthday party.

204
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you want to hear it?

205
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,510
If you want to hear it,

206
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,870
I will tell you.

207
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,480
I know

208
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,150
it is not pleasant

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,150
to be my assistant.

210
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,030
I am strict

211
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,870
and always

212
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,270
boss you around.

213
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,630
If you really feel unfair,

214
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,000
you could be my...

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
be my girlfriend.

216
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,390
If so, I will spoil you

217
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,670
and I can also cook for you every day.

218
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,080
I'll do whatever you ask.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
Isn't that a great deal?

220
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:20,630
Yi,

221
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,750
review the guest list for tonight,

222
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,600
and find out who brought the phone in

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,910
by checking the security footage.

224
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,390
We must do

225
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,150
whatever it takes

226
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,480
to delete all the photos.

227
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,080
Wu,

228
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,790
keep an eye on the news outlets.

229
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,790
If you see anyone trying to publish the news,

230
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,150
be sure to use all connections

231
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,030
to intercept it in advance.

232
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,360
(Okay.)

233
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,960
Jiu,

234
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,000
look into Weibo, Douban, Tianya, and other forums.

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
If there's a whiff of trouble,

236
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,670
nip it in the bud.

237
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,390
Qi,

238
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,150
Qi.

239
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,720
Maury,

240
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,960
bad news.

241
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,790
Mr. Tong wants to pull the plug.

242
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,000
The crew wants to take Yuxi out.

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,670
What?

244
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,750
You Xi,

245
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,080
you ruined the birthday party

246
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,480
of Mr. Tong's daughter.

247
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,510
They got annoyed

248
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,550
and told us they would

249
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,840
withdraw the capital if we don't get you out.

250
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,510
Is that all there is?

251
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,270
Yes.

252
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,630
That's fine.

253
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,630
I'm already done with this.

254
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,440
You Xi,

255
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,550
can't you see that it's a critical time?

256
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,320
Are you kidding me?

257
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,480
Not at all,

258
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,360
I'm really serious.

259
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,120
You...

260
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,270
Lower your voice.

261
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,720
If the little blockhead hears about that,

262
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,120
I...

263
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,750
Mr. You.

264
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,550
Da Zhuang.

265
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,120
You are awake.

266
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,030
Go brush your teeth and wash your face,

267
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,960
and get ready for breakfast.

268
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
I heard everything.

269
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,750
It's all my fault.

270
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,440
I'll go and apologize to Tong Jin.

271
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,600
Yes. Do it now.

272
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,360
Come back.

273
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,600
Who says it's your fault?

274
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,270
It doesn't matter.

275
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,790
I can't get you into trouble because of this.

276
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
I will talk to her.

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,270
Go now.

278
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,030
Come back.

279
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,550
You're not the one who got me into trouble.

280
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm the one who scolded her.

281
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,320
What do you have to do with it?

282
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,960
You can't go without my permission.

283
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,480
Sit down.

284
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,870
Eat the noodles.

285
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,200
Have a try, I just learned it.

286
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,240
No, not in the mood. Put it away.

287
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,440
Tell Mr. Zhang,

288
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,510
I'll be at the office soon.

289
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,870
Maury, it's not Mr. Zhang.

290
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,030
It is the crew of The Founding
of the Three Kingdoms.

291
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,910
They said there is
something important to talk about.

292
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,240
They are so fast.

293
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,630
Follow my instructions.

294
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,550
Get the letter of termination ready in advance.

295
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,720
They are the ones who
will the cancel contract without cause.

296
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
It is their fault.

297
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,750
Maximize our interest
in the termination clause.

298
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,360
Try to recover the loss as much as possible.

299
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,240
Okay, Maury.

300
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,440
Look at that.

301
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,390
They are calling us.

302
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,670
What did I do in my previous life

303
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,840
to become your manager?

304
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,270
I'm leaving.

305
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,080
Enjoy your meal.

306
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,910
Take care, Da Zhuang.

307
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,020
[What happened yesterday was my fault.]

308
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,480
[Tong Jin, what happened yesterday was my fault.
Please don't be mad.]

309
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,110
What are you doing?

310
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,200
Mr. You.

311
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,160
Give it to me.

312
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,960
You still haven't blocked her yet?

313
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,680
And you even sent her this message.

314
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,000
"What happened yesterday was my fault."

315
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,400
"Please don't be mad."

316
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,590
Mr. You.

317
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,160
This is all my fault.

318
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,480
I'll apologize to Tong Jin,

319
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,790
and ask her to talk to her father.

320
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,000
Apologize to her?

321
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,750
Mr. You.

322
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,620
[You, the upstart fake bestie,
could only ask your father for help.]

323
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,340
[Shame on you. Just withdraw your capital.
I'm already done with that.]

324
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,670
[Don't let me see you again
or I'll scold you.]

325
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,150
[Tong Jin]

326
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,590
Apologize?

327
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,310
No way.

328
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,470
[Yao Yao]

329
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,880
You Xi.

330
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,070
Yuchi Yao Yao.

331
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,350
I'm not gonna let you two get away with this!

332
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,920
Mr. Cui.

333
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,270
We can end our contract,

334
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,720
but You Xi

335
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,000
didn't break any terms of the contract.

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,590
You are the ones who are trying
to cancel the contract without cause.

337
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,440
So...

338
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,360
[Records of the Three Kingdoms]

339
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,650
[Records of the Three Kingdoms,
Spring and Autumn Chronicles]

340
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,720
Mr. You.

341
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,440
Finally, I don't have to read books. That's great.

342
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,030
But you've been preparing
for this role for so long.

343
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,830
Now you have to give up.

344
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,070
I wanted to quit long ago.

345
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,960
Besides,

346
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,200
there are many roles for me.

347
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,920
They have to wait in line.

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Coming.

349
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,480
Quick. Let me in.

350
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,790
Let me have some water first.

351
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,440
What happened?

352
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,750
What on earth is going on?

353
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,240
As soon as I arrived at the company,

354
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,790
I sensed hostility.

355
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,720
So I thought there

356
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,750
was definitely no goodwill coming from this.

357
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,480
Therefore,

358
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,310
I've made all the preparations

359
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,750
without any flaws.

360
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,110
Get to the point.

361
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,240
The point is

362
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,510
they won't terminate the contract with you.

363
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,070
Really, Da Zhuang?

364
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,550
What really happened?

365
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,270
Actually,

366
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,960
here's what happened.

367
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
You're the ones who
will cancel the contract without cause.

368
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,070
So...

369
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,350
Maury,

370
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,400
you get me wrong.

371
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,270
We come here

372
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,480
not to cancel the contract.

373
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,550
Won't Tong Tian Ming pull the plug?

374
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,350
Of course, he will.

375
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,510
Why not?

376
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,440
So we

377
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,510
just canceled the contract with him.

378
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,590
Are you kidding me?

381
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,160
This is Mr. Wang

382
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,400

383

384
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,510

the Three Kingdoms.

385
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,720
They also requested

386
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,880
to discuss this with you

387
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,830
face to face.

Yes.

I think this play

Especially the role of Lv Bu,
[*A military general in the Three Kingdoms Period]

393
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,000
it is tailored for You Xi.

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
It has to be him.

395
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,030
If You Xi is willing to take the role,

396
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,880
I will

397
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,790
double my investments immediately.

398
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,400

399

400
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,350
He must be my fan.

to me to be extremely unfair

404
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,400
and feels sorry for me.

That's what

406

00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,590
why don't you join them?

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,720
One, two, three, cheers.

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,030
By the way,

578
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,920
I have something for you.

579
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,960
Here you are.

580
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,400
You left it last time.

581
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,310
Sorry about that.

582
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,960
I left in such a hurry last time.

583
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,640
Thank you.

This time,

589
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,070

Mr. You.

No, no.

598
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,200
You shouldn't wear a hairpin.

599
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,550
Just remove it.

608
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,590
Why are you here?

609

Your, your dad

610
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,310
told me to wait at the door.

Wait a minute.

612
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,440
Mr. You,

613
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,440
don't touch anything

614
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,000

Or else...

Or else?

617
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,510
There was once a student,

618
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,070
who accidentally broke the ornament

619
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,110
in my father's office.

620
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,750
And then...

621
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,790
And then?

622
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,480
He dropped out of school.

623
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,440
Since then,

624
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,160
no one has seen him again.

625
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,440

631
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,480
I'll pay for it.

632
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,000
Is that OK?

633
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,310
Sit down.

634
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,350
It's just a fake.

635
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,070
Young people like you

636
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,720
are always careless.

637
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,830
I would feel worried

638
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,070
if I put a real one here.

639
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,070
I only told you

640
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,590
about this.

641
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,070
Don't spread it.

00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,310

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,550
You mean,

645
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,480
she told you

646
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,070
about the student who dropped out of school

647
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,350
because he broke my ornament?

648
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,070
In fact,

649
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,200
the reason why he dropped out

650
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,750
was because of the demolition of his house.

651
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,640
He dropped out of school

652
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,110
to inherit the family property.

653
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,590
What does it have to do with me?

654
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,000
Since they put it that way,

655
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,270
I just took advantage of it.

656
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,240
That way,

657
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,480
they'll behave themselves

658
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,550
when they are in my office.

659
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,720
That's clever.

665
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,070
thanks for the note

666
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,640
you gave me in secret

667
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,200
when I went up to the podium.

668
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,400
The note?

669
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,270
What note?

670
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,070
I have no idea.

671
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,360
Professor,

672
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,400
why did you

673
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,480
ask me to come here?

674
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,920
I shouldn't have gotten involved

675
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,670
with the business of you young people.

676
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,440
But

677
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,630
Yao Yao is a special case.

678
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,710
I know all about it already.

679
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,110
You know all about it?

680
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,030
And the reason

681
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,590
why Yao Yao has the fear of crowds.

682
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,360
Do you know it too?

683
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,800
Yes.

685
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,360
Yao Yao has never

686
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,880
mentioned this matter

687
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,630
to anyone.

00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,630
If you

689
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,710
can't make Yao Yao happy,

690
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,590
I hope you can leave her as soon as possible.

691
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,670
Because as a father,

692
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,110
I don't want my daughter

693
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,320
