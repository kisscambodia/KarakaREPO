192
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
Mom.

193
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,630
If I hadn't asked my mom

194
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,870
to deliver my speech draft,

195
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,120
she'd be all right.

196
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,080
It's all my fault. My fault.

197
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,550
My...

198
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,840
It's all right.

199
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,390
It's all right.

200
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,790
It's all in the past now.

201
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:05,960
Actually...

202
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,480
I actually haven't finished my words

203
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,030
at the birthday party.

204
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you want to hear it?

205
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,510
If you want to hear it,

206
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,870
I will tell you.

207
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,480
I know

208
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,150
it is not pleasant

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,150
to be my assistant.

210
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,030
I am strict

211
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,870
and always

212
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,270
boss you around.

213
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,630
If you really feel unfair,

214
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,000
you could be my...

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
be my girlfriend.

216
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,390
If so, I will spoil you

217
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,670
and I can also cook for you every day.

218
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,080
I'll do whatever you ask.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
Isn't that a great deal?

220
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,630
Yi,

221
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,750
review the guest list for tonight,

222
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,600
and find out who brought the phone in

223
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,910
by checking the security footage.

224
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,390
We must do

225
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,150
whatever it takes

226
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,480
to delete all the photos.

227
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,080
Wu,

228
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,790
keep an eye on the news outlets.

229
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,790
If you see anyone trying to publish the news,

230
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,150
be sure to use all connections

231
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,030
to intercept it in advance.

232
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,360
(Okay.)

233
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,960
Jiu,

234
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,000
look into Weibo, Douban, Tianya, and other forums.

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,120
If there's a whiff of trouble,

236
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,670
nip it in the bud.

237
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,390
Qi,

238
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,150
Qi.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,720
Maury,

240
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,960
bad news.

241
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,790
Mr. Tong wants to pull the plug.

242
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,000
The crew wants to take Yuxi out.

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,670
What?

244
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,750
You Xi,

245
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,080
you ruined the birthday party

246
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,480
of Mr. Tong's daughter.

247
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,510
They got annoyed

248
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,550
and told us they would

249
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,840
withdraw the capital if we don't get you out.

250
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,510
Is that all there is?

251
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,270
Yes.

252
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,630
That's fine.

253
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,630
I'm already done with this.

254
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,440
You Xi,

255
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,550
can't you see that it's a critical time?

256
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,320
Are you kidding me?

257
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
Not at all,

258
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm really serious.

259
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,120
You...

260
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,270
Lower your voice.

261
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,720
If the little blockhead hears about that,

262
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,120
I...

263
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,750
Mr. You.

264
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,550
Da Zhuang.

265
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,120
You are awake.

266
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,030
Go brush your teeth and wash your face,

267
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,960
and get ready for breakfast.

268
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
I heard everything.

269
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,750
It's all my fault.

270
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,440
I'll go and apologize to Tong Jin.

271
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,600
Yes. Do it now.

272
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,360
Come back.

273
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,600
Who says it's your fault?

274
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,270
It doesn't matter.

275
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,790
I can't get you into trouble because of this.

276
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
I will talk to her.

277
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,270
Go now.

278
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,030
Come back.

279
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,550
You're not the one who got me into trouble.

280
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm the one who scolded her.

281
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,320
What do you have to do with it?

282
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,960
You can't go without my permission.

283
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,480
Sit down.

284
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,870
Eat the noodles.

285
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,200
Have a try, I just learned it.

286
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,240
No, not in the mood. Put it away.

287
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,440
Tell Mr. Zhang,

288
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,510
I'll be at the office soon.

289
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,870
Maury, it's not Mr. Zhang.

290
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,030
It is the crew of The Founding
of the Three Kingdoms.

291
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,910
They said there is
something important to talk about.

292
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,240
They are so fast.

293
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,630
Follow my instructions.

294
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,550
Get the letter of termination ready in advance.

295
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,720
They are the ones who
will the cancel contract without cause.

296
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
It is their fault.

297
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,750
Maximize our interest
in the termination clause.

298
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,360
Try to recover the loss as much as possible.

299
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,240
Okay, Maury.

300
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,440
Look at that.

301
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,390
They are calling us.

302
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,670
What did I do in my previous life

303
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,840
to become your manager?

304
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,270
I'm leaving.

305
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,080
Enjoy your meal.

306
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,910
Take care, Da Zhuang.

307
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,020
[What happened yesterday was my fault.]

308
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,480
[Tong Jin, what happened yesterday was my fault.
Please don't be mad.]

309
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,110
What are you doing?

310
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,200
Mr. You.

311
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,160
Give it to me.

312
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,960
You still haven't blocked her yet?

313
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,680
And you even sent her this message.

314
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,000
"What happened yesterday was my fault."

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,400
"Please don't be mad."

316
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,590
Mr. You.

317
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,160
This is all my fault.

318
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
I'll apologize to Tong Jin,

319
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,790
and ask her to talk to her father.

320
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,000
Apologize to her?

321
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,750
Mr. You.

322
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,620
[You, the upstart fake bestie,
could only ask your father for help.]

323
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,340
[Shame on you. Just withdraw your capital.
I'm already done with that.]

324
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,670
[Don't let me see you again
or I'll scold you.]

325
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,150
[Tong Jin]

326
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,590
Apologize?

327
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,310
No way.

328
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,470
[Yao Yao]

329
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,880
You Xi.

330
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,070
Yuchi Yao Yao.

331
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,350
I'm not gonna let you two get away with this!

332
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,920
Mr. Cui.

333
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,270
We can end our contract,

334
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,720
but You Xi

335
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,000
didn't break any terms of the contract.

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,590
You are the ones who are trying
to cancel the contract without cause.

337
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,440
So...

338
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,360
[Records of the Three Kingdoms]

339
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,650
[Records of the Three Kingdoms,
Spring and Autumn Chronicles]

340
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,720
Mr. You.

341
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,440
Finally, I don't have to read books. That's great.

342
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,030
But you've been preparing
for this role for so long.

343
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,830
Now you have to give up.

344
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,070
I wanted to quit long ago.

345
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,960
Besides,

346
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,200
there are many roles for me.

347
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,920
They have to wait in line.

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,720
Coming.

349
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,480
Quick. Let me in.

350
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,790
Let me have some water first.

351
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,440
What happened?

352
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,750
What on earth is going on?

353
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,240
As soon as I arrived at the company,

354
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,790
I sensed hostility.

355
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,720
So I thought there

356
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,750
was definitely no goodwill coming from this.

357
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,480
Therefore,

358
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,310
I've made all the preparations

359
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,750
without any flaws.

360
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,110
Get to the point.

361
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,240
The point is

362
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,510
they won't terminate the contract with you.

363
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,070
Really, Da Zhuang?

364
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,550
What really happened?

365
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,270
Actually,

366
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,960
here's what happened.

367
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,480
You're the ones who
will cancel the contract without cause.

368
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,070
So...

369
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,350
Maury,

370
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,400
you get me wrong.

371
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,270
We come here

372
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,480
not to cancel the contract.

373
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,550
Won't Tong Tian Ming pull the plug?

374
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,350
Of course, he will.

375
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,510
Why not?

376
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,440
So we

377
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,510
just canceled the contract with him.

378
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,590
Are you kidding me?

381
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,160
This is Mr. Wang

382

383

384
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,510

the Three Kingdoms.

385
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,720
They also requested

386
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,880
to discuss this with you

387
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,830
face to face.

Yes.

Especially the role of Lv Bu,
[*A military general in the Three Kingdoms Period]

393
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,000
it is tailored for You Xi.

394
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,920
It has to be him.

395
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,030
If You Xi is willing to take the role,

396
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,880
I will

397
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,790
double my investments immediately.

398
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,400

400
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,350
He must be my fan.

to me to be extremely unfair

404
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,400
and feels sorry for me.

00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,590
why don't you join them?

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,720
One, two, three, cheers.

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,030
By the way,

578
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,920
I have something for you.

579
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:33,960
Here you are.

580
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,400
You left it last time.

581
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,310
Sorry about that.

582
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,960
I left in such a hurry last time.

583
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,640
Thank you.

This time,

589
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,070

Mr. You.

No, no.

598
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,200
You shouldn't wear a hairpin.

599
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,550
Just remove it.

608
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,590
Why are you here?

609

Your, your dad

610
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,310
told me to wait at the door.

Wait a minute.

612
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,440
Mr. You,

613
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,440
don't touch anything

614
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,000

Or else...

Or else?

617
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,510
There was once a student,

618
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,070
who accidentally broke the ornament

619
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,110
in my father's office.

620
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,750
And then...

621
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,790
And then?

622
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
He dropped out of school.

623
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,440
Since then,

624
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,160
no one has seen him again.

625
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,440

631
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,480
I'll pay for it.

632
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,000
Is that OK?

633
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,310
Sit down.

634
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,350
It's just a fake.

635
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,070
Young people like you

636
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,720
are always careless.

637
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,830
I would feel worried

638
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,070
if I put a real one here.

639
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,070
I only told you

640
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,590
about this.

641
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,070
Don't spread it.

642
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,310

644
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,550
You mean,

645
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,480
she told you

646
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,070
about the student who dropped out of school

647
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,350
because he broke my ornament?

648
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,070
In fact,

649
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,200
the reason why he dropped out

650
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,750
was because of the demolition of his house.

651
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,640
He dropped out of school

652
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,110
to inherit the family property.

653
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,590
What does it have to do with me?

654
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,000
Since they put it that way,

655
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,270
I just took advantage of it.

656
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,240
That way,

657
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,480
they'll behave themselves

658
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,550
when they are in my office.

659
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,720
That's clever.

665
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,070
thanks for the note

666
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,640
you gave me in secret

667
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,200
when I went up to the podium.

668
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,400
The note?

669
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,270
What note?

670
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,070
I have no idea.

671
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,360
Professor,

672
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,400
why did you

673
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,480
ask me to come here?

674
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,920
I shouldn't have gotten involved

675
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,670
with the business of you young people.

676
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,440
But

677
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,630
Yao Yao is a special case.

678
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,710
I know all about it already.

679
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,110
You know all about it?

680
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,030
And the reason

681
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,590
why Yao Yao has the fear of crowds.

682
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,360
Do you know it too?

683
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,800
Yes.

685
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,360
Yao Yao has never

686
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,880
mentioned this matter

687
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,630
to anyone.

00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,630

689
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,710
can't make Yao Yao happy,

690
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,590
I hope you can leave her as soon as possible.

691
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,670

692
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,110
I don't want my daughter

693
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,320
