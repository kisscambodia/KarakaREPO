562
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,440
What's that for?

563
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,790
Excuse me.

564
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm sorry,

565
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,830
but there's an event going on inside.

566
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,270
Only authorized personnel are allowed to enter.

567
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,880
I made a booking

568
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,550
for two in the afternoon.

569
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,750
I'm really sorry.

570
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,440
This event

571
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,350
was supposed to be wrapped up at one.

572
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,750
But something went wrong,

573
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,030
so it hasn't finished yet.

574
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,960
If it's really urgent,

575
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,310
there are many classrooms nearby.

576
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,440
You may book one of them.

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,880
I've always wanted to tell you something.

600
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,070
are you done with the lamp?

601
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,550
If you are, return it now.

602
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,310
Give me a moment!

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,830
Hurry up!

604
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,440
I wanted to surprise you with a song.

605
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,920
I couldn't use the concert hall.

606
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,310
so I booked this classroom

607
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,960
and even borrowed a lamp.

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,750

to the banquet tonight.

I...

633
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,000
Why?

634
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,070
What do you mean why?

635
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,240
Put this on.

636
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,070
I'll

637
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,790
wait for you at the door.

Yes.

641
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,350
Mr. You,

642
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,270
do I really have to wear this?

643
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,030
It feels strange.

644
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,070
You look absolutely stunning in it.

645
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,590
I'm mean...

646
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,400
Hurry up.

647
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,240
We're going to be late.

648
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,790
Take off that necklace.

649
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,680
It's so ugly.

650
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,920
I can't take this off.

651
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
You Xi, you're finally here.

652
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,830
Yuchi Yao Yao,

653
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,310
what are you wearing?

654
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,440
Do you think you can attend

655
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,160
a banquet like this so casually?

656
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,920
Go home now.

657
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Sure, Da Zhuang.

658
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,640
I'll head home now.

Alright.

Go back now.

661

663
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,400
No.

You Xi,

665
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,200
she's an assistant.

666
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,830
What's wrong with being an assistant?

How can I not attend the birthday party

674
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,480
Come on.

675
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,000
Let's go.

676
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,960
Birthday party?

677
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,920
Let me explain, let me explain.

678
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,200
Come, I can explain.

679
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,240
You Xi,

680
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,400
listen to me.

681
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,480
Tell me,

682
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,720
isn't it the investor's banquet?

683
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,310
How did it become Tong Jin's birthday party?

684
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,400
Tong Jin's father

685
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,920
is the investor for
The Founding of the Three Kingdoms.

686
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,750
It's his daughter's birthday today,

687
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,880
so he invited many artistes to celebrate it.

688
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,240
We can't afford to offend him.

689
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,310
Why can't we afford to?

690
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,200
I'll just quit filming it.

691
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,240
Yao Yao,

692
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,720
long time no see.

693
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,590
I'm sorry,

694
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,880
I forgot to invite you to my birthday party.

695
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,790
Are you

696
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,400
here as a part-time waitress?

697
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,310
Are waitresses' uniforms

698
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,640
so sophisticated nowadays?

699
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,310
I...

700
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,790
Let's go in.

701
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,030
What's the rush?

702
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,920
We got together fair and square.

703
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,350
Why the need to hide?

704
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,350
If there are any misunderstandings,

705
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,440
we should clarify them immediately.

706
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,880
It's just a dumb film.

707
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,790
Who wants to be part of it?

708
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,200
No.

709
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,510
Besides,

710
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,030
you're Yao Yao's senior

711
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,640
and I'm good friends with Yao Yao.

712
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,200
I'll let it go for now.

713
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,240
I'll make you pay next time.

714
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,110
Come on.

715
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,640
What are you standing there for?

716
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,110
Let's go.

717
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,000
You Xi?

718
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,480
What's your relationship with her?

719
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,000
Isn't it obvious?

720
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,150
Please excuse us.

721
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,880
Miss Tong,

722
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,150
it's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

723
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,550
How come

724
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,030
she gets to date a huge celebrity like You Xi?

725
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,400
Looks like

726
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,150
I underestimated Yunchi Yao Yao.

727
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
What's wrong?

728
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,150
Are you regretting it already?

729
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,960
Why would I?

730
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,480
Happy birthday, Miss Tong.

731
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,550
Happy birthday, Miss Tong.

732
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:03,960
Jin.

733
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,070
Jin.

734
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,230
My relationship with Yao Yao is all in the past.

735
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,550
Your eyes gave you away.

736
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,630
Don't throw a tantrum.

737
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,440
Don't be angry.

738
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,800
Who is this?

739
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,800
Dan,

740
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,440
This is the star of tonight's birthday party,

741
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,280
Tong Jin.

742
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,590
She's the daughter of the Tong family.

743
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,710
She looks so ordinary.

744
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,760
Of course.

745
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,880
She is no match

746
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,320
for you.

747
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,150
If it wasn't for her father,

748
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,590
she would be nothing.

749
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,230
For an honored guest like Dan

750
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,280
to grace this event

751
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,400
is a privilege for her.

752
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Dan,

753
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,150
we'll go over there to do a toast first.

754
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,800
Dan,

755
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,840
it's been a while.

756
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,400
You're more radiant than ever.

757
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,230
You're too kind, Mr. Sun.

758
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,710
You flatter me.

759
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,440
Dan,

760
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,000
please give me your fullest support

761
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,670
for my upcoming movie.

762
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,480
You Xi,

763
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,440
I'll go over and greet them.

764
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,920
Let's go too.

765
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,550
You must support us!

766
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,440
Dan,

767
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,360
Mr. Sun.

768
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,400
It's been a while.

769
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,280
It's been a while.

770
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,400
Mr. Sun, I like your project.

771
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,030
But I have one condition.

772
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,030
I'll invest if You Xi is acting in it.

773
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,150
You Xi,

774
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,800
the director and investors are over there.

775
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,920
Let's go and greet them.

776
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,760
I'll head over first.

777
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,670
Be right back.

778
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Will you be alright by yourself?

779
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,880
I'll be fine, Mr. You.

780
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,190
You go ahead.

781
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,360
If you need anything,

782
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,670
let me know.

783
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,480
I'll be right over.

784
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,550
Come, now.

785
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,470
[Happy Birthday]

786
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,760
You Xi,

787
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,000
can you take a photo with us?

788
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,800
Take a photo with us.

789
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,480
I'm sorry, girls.

790
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,110
Take a photo!

791
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,630
Today, You Xi

792
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,760
only came to attend Ms. Tong's birthday party.

793
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,320
If you want to take a photo with him,

794
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,670
can we do so next time?

795
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

796
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,150
-Have fun.
-Next time then.

797
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,440
Let's go.

798
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,230
You Xi,

799
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,150
let me introduce them to you.

800
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,070
This is one of our most famous investors, Dan.

801
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,880
This is Mr. Sun.

802
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,150
Thank you.

803
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,000
You Xi, I'm so happy to meet you.

804
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,670
Hello, Dan.

805
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,360
Hello, Mr. Sun.

806
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,440
You're even more handsome in real life.

807
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,070
That's right.

808
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,960
Why are you hiding here alone?

809
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,440
It looks like you are still

810
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,710
suffering from enochlophobia.

811
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,110
Where's your boyfriend?

812
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,320
Has he abandoned you already?

813
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,110
What are you talking about?

814
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,190
How long have you been

815
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,840
dating your boss?

816
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,070
Let me guess.

817
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,030
Was it after we broke up

818
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,230
or before?

819
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,800
Yuchi Yao Yao,

820
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,590
I really underestimated you.

821
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,710
Dan,

822
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,230
You're beautiful, sophisticated, and elegant.

823
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,960
Which brand of facial mask do you use?

824
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,400
Mr. You is my boss.

825
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,590
That's all.

826
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,360
Dan,

827
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,550
you're too humble.

828
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,760
Please take care of You Xi in the future.

829
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,880
He might be able to deceive you,

830
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,280
but not me.

831
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,190
If you don't believe me, see for yourself.

832
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,150
He's talking to someone else.

833
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,320
But his eyes

834
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,510
have been fixed on you.

835
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,360
Of course.

836
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,070
To be favored by you, Dan,

837
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,150
is truly amazing.

838
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,360
Isn't that right, You Xi?

839
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,840
Right.

840
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
It looks like he's seen us together.

841
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,480
He must be very anxious.

842
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,510
Stop talking nonsense.

843
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,670
You don't believe me?

844
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,800
I'm sorry.

845
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,320
Please excuse me.

846
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,800
You Xi.

847
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,760
I'm sorry.

848
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,510
Everyone.

849
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,280
Wait.

850
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,630
Thank you for attending my
birthday party, everyone.

851
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,630
I want to thank my dad, too,

852
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,710
for organizing this grand banquet for me.

853
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,110
Actually,

854
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,550
the one I'm most thankful to

855
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,320
is my good friend,

856
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,320
Yuchi Yao Yao.

857
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,000
In the past year,

858
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,030
she gave me lots of help and encouragement.

859
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,360
Therefore,

860
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,960
I'd like to

861
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,280
invite her up on stage.

862
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,630
Come on up, Yao Yao.

863
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,400
No, no.

864
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,590
No, no.

865
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,760
Don't make a scene.

866
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,880
Yao Yao,

867
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,880
