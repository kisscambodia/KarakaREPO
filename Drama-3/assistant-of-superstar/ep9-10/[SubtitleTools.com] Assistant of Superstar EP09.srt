562
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,440
What's that for?

563
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,790
Excuse me.

564
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,920
I'm sorry,

565
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,830
but there's an event going on inside.

566
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,270
Only authorized personnel are allowed to enter.

567
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,880
I made a booking

568
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,550
for two in the afternoon.

569
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,750
I'm really sorry.

570
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,440
This event

571
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,350
was supposed to be wrapped up at one.

572
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,750
But something went wrong,

573
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,030
so it hasn't finished yet.

574
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,960
If it's really urgent,

575
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,310
there are many classrooms nearby.

576
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,440
You may book one of them.

I've always wanted to tell you something.

600
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,070
are you done with the lamp?

601
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,550
If you are, return it now.

602
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,310
Give me a moment!

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,830
Hurry up!

604
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,440
I wanted to surprise you with a song.

605
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,920
I couldn't use the concert hall.

606
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,310
so I booked this classroom

607
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,960
and even borrowed a lamp.

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,750

to the banquet tonight.

633
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,000
Why?

634
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,070
What do you mean why?

635
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Put this on.

636
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,070
I'll

637
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,790
wait for you at the door.

Yes.

641
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,350
Mr. You,

642
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,270
do I really have to wear this?

643
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,030
It feels strange.

644
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,070
You look absolutely stunning in it.

645
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,590
I'm mean...

646
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,400
Hurry up.

647
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,240
We're going to be late.

648
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,790
Take off that necklace.

649
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,680
It's so ugly.

650
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,920
I can't take this off.

651
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,960
You Xi, you're finally here.

652
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,830
Yuchi Yao Yao,

653
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,310
what are you wearing?

654
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,440
Do you think you can attend

655
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,160
a banquet like this so casually?

656
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,920
Go home now.

657
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Sure, Da Zhuang.

658
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,640
I'll head home now.

Alright.

Go back now.

661

663
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,400
No.

You Xi,

665
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,200
she's an assistant.

666
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,830
What's wrong with being an assistant?

How can I not attend the birthday party

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,480
Come on.

675
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,000
Let's go.

676
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,960
Birthday party?

677
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,920
Let me explain, let me explain.

678
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,200
Come, I can explain.

679
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,240

680
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,400
listen to me.

681
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,480
Tell me,

682
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,720
isn't it the investor's banquet?

683
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,310
How did it become Tong Jin's birthday party?

684
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,400
Tong Jin's father

685
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,920
is the investor for
The Founding of the Three Kingdoms.

686
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,750
It's his daughter's birthday today,

687
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,880
so he invited many artistes to celebrate it.

688
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,240
We can't afford to offend him.

689
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,310
Why can't we afford to?

690
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,200
I'll just quit filming it.

691
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,240
Yao Yao,

692
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,720
long time no see.

693
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,590
I'm sorry,

694
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,880
I forgot to invite you to my birthday party.

695
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,790
Are you

696
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,400
here as a part-time waitress?

697
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,310
Are waitresses' uniforms

698
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,640
so sophisticated nowadays?

699
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,310
I...

700
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,790
Let's go in.

701
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,030
What's the rush?

702
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,920
We got together fair and square.

703
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,350
Why the need to hide?

704
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,350
If there are any misunderstandings,

705
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,440
we should clarify them immediately.

706
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,880
It's just a dumb film.

707
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,790
Who wants to be part of it?

708
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,200
No.

709
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,510
Besides,

710
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,030
you're Yao Yao's senior

711
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,640
and I'm good friends with Yao Yao.

712
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,200
I'll let it go for now.

713
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,240
I'll make you pay next time.

714
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,110
Come on.

715
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,640
What are you standing there for?

716
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,110
Let's go.

717
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,000
You Xi?

718
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,480
What's your relationship with her?

719
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,000
Isn't it obvious?

720
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,150
Please excuse us.

721
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,880
Miss Tong,

722
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,150
it's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

723
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,550
How come

724
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,030
she gets to date a huge celebrity like You Xi?

725
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,400
Looks like

726
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,150
I underestimated Yunchi Yao Yao.

727
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
What's wrong?

728
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,150
Are you regretting it already?

729
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,960
Why would I?

730
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,480
Happy birthday, Miss Tong.

731
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,550
Happy birthday, Miss Tong.

732
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:20,960
Jin.

733
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,070
Jin.

734
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,230
My relationship with Yao Yao is all in the past.

735
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,550
Your eyes gave you away.

736
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,630
Don't throw a tantrum.

737
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,440
Don't be angry.

738
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,800
Who is this?

739
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,800
Dan,

740
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,440
This is the star of tonight's birthday party,

741
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,280
Tong Jin.

742
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,590
She's the daughter of the Tong family.

743
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,710
She looks so ordinary.

744
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,760
Of course.

745
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,880
She is no match

746
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,320
for you.

747
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,150
If it wasn't for her father,

748
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,590
she would be nothing.

749
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,230
For an honored guest like Dan

750
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,280
to grace this event

751
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,400
is a privilege for her.

752
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,840
Dan,

753
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,150
we'll go over there to do a toast first.

754
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,800
Dan,

755
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,840
it's been a while.

756
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,400
You're more radiant than ever.

757
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,230
You're too kind, Mr. Sun.

758
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,710
You flatter me.

759
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,440
Dan,

760
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,000
please give me your fullest support

761
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,670
for my upcoming movie.

762
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,480
You Xi,

763
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,440
I'll go over and greet them.

764
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,920
Let's go too.

765
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,550
You must support us!

766
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,440
Dan,

767
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,360
Mr. Sun.

768
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
It's been a while.

769
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,280
It's been a while.

770
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,400
Mr. Sun, I like your project.

771
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,030
But I have one condition.

772
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,030
I'll invest if You Xi is acting in it.

773
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,150
You Xi,

774
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,800
the director and investors are over there.

775
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
Let's go and greet them.

776
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,760
I'll head over first.

777
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,670
Be right back.

778
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Will you be alright by yourself?

779
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,880
I'll be fine, Mr. You.

780
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,190
You go ahead.

781
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,360
If you need anything,

782
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,670
let me know.

783
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,480
I'll be right over.

784
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,550
Come, now.

785
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,470
[Happy Birthday]

786
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,760
You Xi,

787
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
can you take a photo with us?

788
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,800
Take a photo with us.

789
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,480
I'm sorry, girls.

790
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,110
Take a photo!

791
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,630
Today, You Xi

792
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,760
only came to attend Ms. Tong's birthday party.

793
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,320
If you want to take a photo with him,

794
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,670
can we do so next time?

795
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

796
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,150
-Have fun.
-Next time then.

797
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,440
Let's go.

798
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,230
You Xi,

799
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,150
let me introduce them to you.

800
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,070
This is one of our most famous investors, Dan.

801
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,880
This is Mr. Sun.

802
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,150
Thank you.

803
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,000
You Xi, I'm so happy to meet you.

804
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,670
Hello, Dan.

805
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,360
Hello, Mr. Sun.

806
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,440
You're even more handsome in real life.

807
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,070
That's right.

808
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,960
Why are you hiding here alone?

809
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,440
It looks like you are still

810
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,710
suffering from enochlophobia.

811
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,110
Where's your boyfriend?

812
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,320
Has he abandoned you already?

813
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,110
What are you talking about?

814
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,190
How long have you been

815
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,840
dating your boss?

816
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,070
Let me guess.

817
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,030
Was it after we broke up

818
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,230
or before?

819
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,800
Yuchi Yao Yao,

820
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,590
I really underestimated you.

821
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,710
Dan,

822
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,230
You're beautiful, sophisticated, and elegant.

823
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,960
Which brand of facial mask do you use?

824
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,400
Mr. You is my boss.

825
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,590
That's all.

826
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,360
Dan,

827
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,550
you're too humble.

828
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,760
Please take care of You Xi in the future.

829
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,880
He might be able to deceive you,

830
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,280
but not me.

831
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,190
If you don't believe me, see for yourself.

832
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,150
He's talking to someone else.

833
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,320
But his eyes

834
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,510
have been fixed on you.

835
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,360
Of course.

836
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,070
To be favored by you, Dan,

837
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,150
is truly amazing.

838
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,360
Isn't that right, You Xi?

839
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,840
Right.

840
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
It looks like he's seen us together.

841
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,480
He must be very anxious.

842
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,510
Stop talking nonsense.

843
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,670
You don't believe me?

844
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm sorry.

845
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,320
Please excuse me.

846
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,800
You Xi.

847
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
I'm sorry.

848
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,510
Everyone.

849
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,280
Wait.

850
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,630
Thank you for attending my
birthday party, everyone.

851
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,630
I want to thank my dad, too,

852
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,710
for organizing this grand banquet for me.

853
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,110
Actually,

854
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,550
the one I'm most thankful to

855
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,320
is my good friend,

856
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,320
Yuchi Yao Yao.

857
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,000
In the past year,

858
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,030
she gave me lots of help and encouragement.

859
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,360
Therefore,

860
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
I'd like to

861
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,280
invite her up on stage.

862
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,630
Come on up, Yao Yao.

863
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,400
No, no.

864
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,590
No, no.

865
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,760
Don't make a scene.

866
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,880
Yao Yao,

867
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,880
