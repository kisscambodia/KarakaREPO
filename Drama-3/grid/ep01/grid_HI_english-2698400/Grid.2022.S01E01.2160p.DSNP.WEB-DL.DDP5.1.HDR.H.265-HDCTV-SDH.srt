Someone is unconscious here.

236
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,146
I'm at a convenience store
near Green Apartment in Pyosudong.

When I walked in,
I smelled nothing but cup noodles.

247
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:36,316
And I think he was holding a beer can
when he walked out of the store later.

248
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,486
You thought he was a part-timer
at this store,

249
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,026
but he was holding a beer can?

250
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:43,946
I thought he was a part-timer
cleaning up or something.

251
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:52,536
(door squeaks)

252
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:05,296
DETECTIVE 1: Here's the cup <i>ramyeon</i>
the suspect supposedly ate.

253
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:08,716
SAEHA: This man.

254
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:10,266
This fellow?

00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:12,976

00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:16,106

(mysterious music)

258
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:31,326
DETECTIVE 2: What? Look at him.
He paid cash.

259
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:36,246
Did he plan to kill him?
Or did he not have a credit card?

260
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:40,046
The victim is saying something here.

261
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,006
(mouse clicks)

262
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:43,676
Did they know each other?
You think it was a grudge killing?

263
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:46,216
What is he saying? Rewind it.

264
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:50,886
"Excuse me, sir.
You can't drink alcohol in here."

265
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:53,726
-Who?
-He told the suspect

266
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,146
not to drink alcohol in the store.

267
00:22:55,226 --> 00:22:57,516
The victim did? How do you know?

268
00:22:57,606 --> 00:22:58,936
SAEHA: That's what he said.

269
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,026
Right. I think he's right.

270
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:04,106
SAEBYEOK: When he opened the can here,

271
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,066
the victim said something
looking at the table.

272
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,326
He must've heard the can opening.

273
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:11,326
-Can I go now, then?
-Sorry?

274
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,996
-Hey, can he?
-DETECTIVE 2: Yes, I got his number.

275
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:15,666
All right.

276
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,376
CHIEF: What about the fingerprints?

277
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:21,916
-SAEBYEOK: Well...
-CHIEF: My gosh. It's all smudged.

278
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:24,506
-SAEBYEOK: Just a minute.
-CHIEF: We can't use any of these.

279
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,216
Gosh, this is not good.

280
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:28,636
Jeez.

281
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,306
(tense music)

282
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:38,806

283
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:48,696
(camera shutter clicks)

284
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,206
His fingers must be covered with calluses.

285
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:57,366
SAEBYEOK: He must've done hard labor
for a long time.

286
00:23:57,456 --> 00:24:00,496
People who do hard labor are
the hardest to identify. Jeez.

287
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:02,796
Huh?

288
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,386
-CHIEF: Hey, keep playing.
-DETECTIVE 2: Yes, sir.

289
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:14,426
DETECTIVE 1:
He's saying something again here.

290
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:16,096
DETECTIVE 2: Should I rewind it?

291
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:22,566
Wait, sir.

292
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:27,776
You can read people's lips, can't you?

293
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:29,656
So?

294
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:33,026
SAEBYEOK: The victim told the suspect
not to drink inside, but he ignored it.

295
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:36,116
Here. What is the victim saying here?

296
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:42,036
SAEBYEOK: It seems that the suspect
heard him say something

297
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:43,956
and followed him to the storage room.

298
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,126
-I'll show you again.
-(keyboard taps)

299
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:49,796
"What an ill-bred punk.
Did he grow up without parents?"

300
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:53,346
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

301
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:58,516
SAEHA: Is there no security camera
in here?

302
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:04,516
SAEBYEOK: There is one.
But it's behind a box.

303
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:10,816
That man bought garbage bags here.

304
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:12,566
I'm sure he doesn't have any plans.

305
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:15,236
I guess his wife nags him
if he makes her wait.

306
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:18,786
He just doesn't want to get involved.
You know how people are these days.

307
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:20,166
(chief sucks teeth)

308
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:21,326
Let's see.

309

(chief sucks teeth)

310
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:27,166
Did he stab him in a fit of anger
because he said he was ill-bred?

311
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:31,886
If this is a random murder,
it's going to be a headache.

312
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:36,306

313

-I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

321
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:16,216
No, it's okay. By the way,
I definitely saw garbage bags here...

322
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:17,506
I'll take care of this.

323
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:19,466
And I'll pay you for the extra work.

324
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,596
No, it's just once in a while.

325
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:23,516
I've worked many places,

326
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:27,266
but I've never seen anyone
as devoted to their parents as you are.

327
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:28,356

A razor. I worked late last night

00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:21,766
Hey, go this way.

541
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:24,056
Damn it. Where did he go?

542
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:25,516
Hyunjun! Is he not there?

543
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:27,146
-No.
-Gosh.

544
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:28,646
Damn it.

545
00:42:33,856 --> 00:42:37,236
(retreating footsteps)

546
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,246
(panting)

547
00:42:55,336 --> 00:42:56,546
(gun cocks)

548
00:42:56,636 --> 00:42:58,506
(suspenseful music)

549
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:00,016
Move forward slowly.

550
00:43:04,596 --> 00:43:06,806
(suspenseful music intensifies)

551
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:13,646
Get down on the ground.

552
00:43:20,576 --> 00:43:21,576
(thuds)

553
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:23,866
(breathes heavily)

554
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:27,746
(tense music)

555
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,246
-(grunts)
-(thuds)

556
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:31,706
(pants)

557
00:43:31,796 --> 00:43:33,876
(tense music continues)

558
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,306
(grunts)

559
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:52,776
(transcendental music)

560
00:43:57,616 --> 00:44:00,696
(crackles)

561
00:44:04,956 --> 00:44:07,536
(transcendental music)

562
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:17,046
SAEHA: <i>"A woman presumed
to be an accomplice"?</i>

563
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:23,886
(mysterious music)

564
00:44:39,616 --> 00:44:40,736
(keyboard clacking)

565
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:44,236
SAEBYEOK: <i>The taser was damaged when I
dropped it while being attacked by a woman</i>

566
00:44:44,326 --> 00:44:46,206
<i>presumed to be the suspect's accomplice.</i>

567
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:57,926
Hey, you just lost him.
Why are you talking nonsense?

568
00:44:58,006 --> 00:44:59,546
You should stay quiet.

569
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:02,506
She really vanished into thin air
right before my eyes.

570
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:03,426
(detective 1 sighs)

571
00:45:03,506 --> 00:45:05,466
How are we going to find him
this late at night?

572
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:08,516
DETECTIVE 4: We almost caught him.
That was so close.

573
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:13,566
This evidence means
that he has an accomplice.

574
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:15,896
Yes, he obviously does.

575
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:19,146
Who do you think threw down
the rope for him from the rooftop?

576
00:45:19,856 --> 00:45:22,906
But you're saying
that accomplice was a phantom.

577
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:24,866
She disappeared like a ghost?

578
00:45:25,696 --> 00:45:27,706
Hey. Who would believe that?

579
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:29,456
Damn it.

580
00:45:29,576 --> 00:45:31,076
(grunts)

581
00:45:31,626 --> 00:45:33,416

582
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:45,006
(pensive music)

583
00:45:46,346 --> 00:45:49,516
AFTER THAT, THE WOMAN...

584
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:54,856
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR...

585
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:56,436
SAEHA: <i>"Suddenly disappeared
into thin air"?</i>

586
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:59,066
SAEBYEOK: <i>After that, the woman suddenly
disappeared into thin air,</i>

587
00:45:59,146 --> 00:46:00,696
<i>so I couldn't arrest her.</i>

588
00:46:11,826 --> 00:46:12,876
(mouse clicks)

589
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:20,216

00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:21,986
(pensive music intensifies, stops)

595
00:47:22,066 --> 00:47:24,146
