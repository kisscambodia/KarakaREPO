you won't let me live in peace.

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,540
I don't know

12
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,140
if I should

13
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,940

The accomplices of Eunuch Li's corruption case

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,260
and sent to the imperial prison.

Take your time to interrogate them.

Don't let any of them off the hook.

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,570
Yes.

Chen Youyou is not back yet?

26
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
She came back for awhile and

27
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,780
went out again.

28
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,820
I'm not sure if she's with His Royal Highness.

29
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,500
Well,

30
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,780
shall I bring her back?

31
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,460
No need!

32
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,220
She can go wherever she wants!

It's late now,

My lord!

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,180
Chen Youyou.

42
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,020
Why are you being so mysterious?

43
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,380
My lord.

44
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,700
I was wrong.

45
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,450
I shouldn’t have touched the spirit tablets without permission.

46
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,020
To show my sincerity,

47
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,770
I prepared something for you.

48
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,380
Come.

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,740
Follow me.

50
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,340
This is...

51
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,900
I disturbed the ancestors.

52
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,460
I prepared these

53
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,540
river lanterns to pray for them.

54
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,540
Pray?

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,540
My mother died at an early age.

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,140
Since I was young,

57
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,620
I've been wandering around.

58
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,260
I always thought myself as

59
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,300
a kid without a home.

60
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,930
I didn't even know where to commemorate her.

61
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,220
Later on, I heard from an old man

62
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,020
that as long as I light a river lantern,

63
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,659
I can pray for her.

64
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,340
So,

65
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,540
I hope these river lanterns

66
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,340
can also bring happiness and peace

67
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,020
to your family.

68
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,500
Thank you.

69
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,220
Then, my lord,

70
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,460
this means we've made up.

71
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,780
If I

72
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,610
knew more about you,

73
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,540
I would not only avoid making you angry,

74
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,140
but I'd also avoid misunderstandings.

75
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,420
Understand me more?

76
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,540
Yes.

77
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,300
I also want to know...

78
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,659
what is your favorite food.

79
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,780
What you dislike...

80
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,140
Other than dust, what else are you allergic to?

81
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,820
What spices do you use? How do you stay young?

82
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,820
When do you go to bed?

83
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,180
Also,

84
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,780
do you

85
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,250
like Miss Jiang?

86
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,860
Miss Jiang’s father helped the Su...

87
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,810
the Bai family before.

88
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,820
I took her in

89
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
to repay the favor.

90
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,620
Are you really just repaying the favor?

91
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
It's my turn to ask you.

92
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,180
Recently,

93
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,340
who have you been with?

94
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,220
Recently, I have been with...

95
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,490
with...

96
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,380
with His Royal Highness.

97
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,580
But, please don't overthink!

98
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,500
He has been obsessed with cooking,

99
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,500
so I helped him.

100
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,730
Bai's Mansion is your home.

101
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,410

103
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,220
My lord, I wasn't done whith my questions.

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,860
One question per day.

105
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,020
No way.

106
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,860
What if I

107
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
don't ask all the questions and make you angry again?

108
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,020
My lord, wait for me!

109
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,850
Bai's Mansion is your home.

110
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,580
Don't always run out when you're free.

111
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,180
I hope these river lanterns

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,660
can also bring happiness and peace

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,460

What am I imagining?

115

My lord!

116
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,660
My lord, why are you still up?

117
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,340
I'm not sleepy.

118
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,610
My lord, I made noodles. They smell good!

119
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,660
Do you want to eat with me?

120
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,700
I'm not hungry.

121
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,180
My lord!

122
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,740
Why are you blushing?

123
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,860
Forget it!

124
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,540
I'll eat them myself.

126
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,850
My lord,

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,890
it's mid-summer today.

128
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,539
The kitchen specially prepared soup noodles

129
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,820
to cool down the heat.

130
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,980
I don't want them!

131
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,780
From now on, no more eating noodles in the mansion.

132
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,420
Well...

133
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,060
Why are we suddenly not allowed to eat noodles?

134
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,500
Tiao, what are you doing? My noodles!

135
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,900
Miss,

136
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,420
Lord Bai just stated

137
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,900
no more eating noodles in the mansion.

138
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,820
Those who violate this command will be expelled.

139
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,860
Did noodles offend you?

140
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,490
He didn't look well

141
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,330
when I cooked noodles last night,

142
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,860
and now he's doing this.

143
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,020
You really can't mess with him.

144
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,140
That's weird.

145
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,900
He always finished his vegetable soup noodles

146
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,660
every mid-summer.

147
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,100
Why did he suddenly...

148
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,140
Miss,

149
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,340
this must have something to do with Chen Youyou.

150
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,730
Ever since she's here,

151
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,500
everything has changed in Bai's Mansion.

152
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,500
This construction work has been delayed for months!

153
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,620
What's the use of all of you?

154
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,540
Madam De.

155
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
The emphasis on beauty

156
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,180
is the tradition of Fuxian City.

157
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
I think

158
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
the imperial palace for the memorial of the late castellan

159
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,900
must be magnificent,

160
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,490
elegant,

161
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,620
and beautiful.

162
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,210
[Aunt Qi Shengwen, former castellan's concubine]

163
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,340
Ordinary,

164
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,580
aleatoric,

165
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,060
and spiritless!

166
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,940
Bai,

167
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,180
you're late.

168
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,820
Do you not respect Madam De?

169
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,500
Madam's palace

170
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,420
is not suitable to be decorated with gold and silver.

171
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,610
First, it's too ordinary.

172
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,820
Second, the style is different from the palace.

173
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,540
I'm afraid it may be seen as a threat to the throne.

174
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
I came late

175
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,020
because I went to find a spiritual item, the twin lotus flowers.

176
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,820
Twin lotus flowers?

177
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,580
Also known as hibiscuses with the same heart.

178
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,860
It means to be together forever.

179
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,460
This imperial palace renovation is

180
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,700
for the late castellan.

181
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,140
I believe all things have spirits, and

182
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,180
I'm sure he'll get our longings.

183
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,700
It sounds good.

184
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,340
Lotus sharing the same stem, twin lotus flowers

185
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,380
are rare.

186
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,980
Bai,

187
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,700
it seems you just wanted to avoid punishment for being late

188
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,340
and blabbered out nonsense.

189
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,620
Don't worry, Lord Xian.

190
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,220
I'll be sure to satisfy madam.

191
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,340
It's decided then.

192
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,100
Bai will be fully responsible

193
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,060
for the renovation of the imperial palace.

194
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,980
Yes.

195
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,300
But Bai,

196
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,180
if you let me down,

197
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,420
I won't spare you.

198
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,620
Yes.

199
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,220
Youyou,

200
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,540
why are you so hungry?

201
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,060
Did Bai Li torture you again?

202
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,500
Don’t mention it.

203
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,740
But, the texture of this wild ginger cake

204
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,700
is really tender!

205
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,020
Really?

206
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,180
I bought a lot of fresh ingredients today.

207
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,940
Let’s make something new.

208
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,020
Okay!

209
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Youyou! Look at my skills.

210
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,410
My lord,

211
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,620
Madam De has a bad temper,

212
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,580
and she is very hard to serve.

213
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,220
No one in the city dares to take on

214
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,490
the task of renovating the imperial palace.

215
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,100
Why do you want to suffer?

216
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,220
Lord Xian wants to impress Madam De

217
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,380
by renovating the imperial palace.

218
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,940
I won't let him do as he wishes.

219
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,420
My lord,

220
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,260
we've been hiding and playing weak for so many years.

221
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,890
Is it appropriate

222
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,060
if we act rashly now?

223
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,620
Lord Xian has provoked me many times.

224
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,860
I don't want to get involved with him.

225
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,250
However, he made Mrs. Zhao

226
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,530
set such an evil plan.

227
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,540
I must suppress him.

228
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,260
But, you didn't drink that sweet soup.

229
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,020
Why are you so angry?

230
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,580
What do you know!

231
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,340
In the pond of Su family's yard,

232
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,660
there were twin lotus flowers.

233
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,740
I remember they were transplanted from a place

234
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,540
10 miles south from the city.

235
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,540
Go and check it out.

236
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,580
Yes.

237
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,460
Also known as hibiscuses with the same heart.

238
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,700
It means to be together forever.

239
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,340
This imperial palace renovation is

240
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,420
for the late castellan.

241
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,060
I believe all things have spirits, and

242
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm sure he¡ll get our longings.

243
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,020
Do all things

244

-Have a taste. -Miss.

248
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,820
I just made these with His Royal Highness.

249
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,660
It's delicious!

250
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,060
What’s wrong?

251
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,380
You're frowning.

252
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,340
You're rushing me again.

253
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,500
Aren't you tired of drawing like that every day?

254
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,300
Your Highness has delicate skin.

255
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,660
I believe this drawing

256
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,300
will lead a new trend.

257
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,100
I’m angry today, so

258
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,460
I need an extra drawing

259
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,860
to compensate myself.

260
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,700
Your Highness.

261
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,420
Your Highness, don't be angry.

262
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,660
I’ll report to you on

263
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,900
Bai Li's latest situation now.

264
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,780
Lord Bai has rhinitis.

265
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,700
He sneezes at home all day.

266
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,740
He washes his face with clean water every day.

267
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,020
Recently, he started using a tea-colored towel.

268
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,980
Also, this morning, he suddenly ordered

269
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
the prohibition of noodles in Bai's Mansion.

270
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,300
I don't know why!

271
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,100
He is...

272
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,980
Chen Youyou.

273
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,420

These are snacks made by the imperial chef.

278
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,820
Castellan specially sent them over

279
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,770
as a reward for your proposal.

280
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,820
Leave them.

281
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,580
Wait a minute.

282
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,540
Go and ask Chen Youyou to come here.

283
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,300
Miss Chen is not back yet.

284
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,020
Why is she not back yet?

285
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,980
Maybe something happened?

286
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,850
But, don't worry, my lord!

287
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,580

Yes.

Well...

Where can I go and break them for you, Your Highness?

296

Anyway, I can’t let Bai Li get what he wants.

If you can’t do it,

298

the thing that is going to break

299
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,530
is not the lotus,

300
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,619
but your father’s head.

301
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,339
Yes.

302
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,460
Have you arranged

I'm not forcing you.

then forget it.

312
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,140
you can meddle in anyone's business,

313

but you choose to go against Lord Xian.

314
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,180
Initially, I only had to say simple things.

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,810

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,620
Then, it's this one.

382
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
It's not completely broken.

383
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,580
I can still work.

384
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,780
Guys,

385
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,940
back to work.

386
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,860
Move!

387
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,060
-You should have told me earlier. -Get back to work.

388
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,140
Get back to work.

389
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,380
-Get up. -Let's go!

390
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,580
Your legs and feet are quite agile.

391
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,180
There should be no more mistakes

392
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,380
with the renovation of the imperial palace.

393
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,540
Don't worry, my lord.

394
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,100
I will keep a close eye

395
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,530
on him.

396
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,420
No,

397
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,300
Chen Youyou.

398
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,300
You can't do things that harm others!

399
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,090
I have to think of another way.

400
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,620
Then, my dad...

401
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,460
Forget it!

402
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,100
Just do it!

403
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,380
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,020
Forget it...

405
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,740
Forget it.

406
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,820
One is my dad,

407
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,940
and one is Bai Li.

408
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,740
What should I do?

409
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,740
What are you doing?

410
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,940
My lord,

411
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,140
if I say...

412
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,620
I picked the flowers to make lotus seed soup for you,

413
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,860
will you believe me?

414
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,620
What do you think?

415
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,460
I...

416
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,140
My lord.

417
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,380
Madam De will inspect

418
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
the twin lotus flowers in two hours.

419
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,620
Now the lotus is gone,

420
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,940
what should we do?

421
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,300
You...

422
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,060
It's over.

423
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,220
Now, it's all over!

424
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,580
I'm sorry...

425
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,420
I didn't mean it.
