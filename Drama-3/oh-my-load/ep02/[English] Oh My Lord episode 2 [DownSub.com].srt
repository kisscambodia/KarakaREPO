[Episode 2]

4
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,660
Miss.

5
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,220
Miss!

6
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,100
Tiao!

7
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,060
What's wrong?

8
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
Are you okay?

9
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,780
I'm fine.

10
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,900
I have no idea what happened.

11
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,900
They dragged me out

12
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,260
from Lord Xian's Palace last night.

13
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,700
They asked me to be the bride's maid

14
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,940
and follow the wedding sedan.

15
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,060
They didn't allow me to see you.

16
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,570
They said you were...

17
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,180
They said you were in the bridal chamber.

18
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,700
Tiao, I know this.

19
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,900
I know.

20
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,180
Miss,

21
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,820
what should we do next?

22
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,340
I heard that Lord Bai

23
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,420
has a bad temper.

24
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,579
It's hard to serve him.

25
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,740
Don't worry.

26
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,170
Let's keep ourselves safe first,

27
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,940
and then find a way to save my dad.

28
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,300
Miss, don't worry.

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,700
I won't go west if you ask me to go east.

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,060
I won't go north if you ask me to go south.

31
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,100
I will do whatever you say...

32
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,660
Tiao!

33
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,860
I will work hard.

34
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,100
Lord.

35
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,170
I see.

36
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,220
Then, this will be easy.

37
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,020
What do you mean?

38
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,820
-What did you... -Shh!

39
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,020
Let's go.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,940
Go.

41
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,260
If you keep being careless,

42
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,620
go and receive your punishment voluntarily.

43
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,460
It's my fault.

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,820
Lord!

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,980
How's the investigation going?

48
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,260
Chen Youyou

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,220
came to Fuxian City six months ago.

50
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,380
In the past,

51
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,380
she was just a wild girl on the street.

52
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,500
A wild girl?

53
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,460
Yes.

54
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,660
She left her hometown when she was little

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,540
and has been wandering around since then.

56
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,300
I have sent some men

57
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,140
to look for information in her hometown.

58
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,060
Keep an eye on her.

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,660
Report to me if anything happens.

60
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,100
Lord,

61
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,820
although she is innocent for now,

62
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,700
she almost knew your real identity

63
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,220
in the House of Respectful Affairs that day.

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,460
She also saw

65
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,060
how you executed the eunuch.

66
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,140
If you let her stay,

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,620
I'm afraid...

68
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,900
She told a lie and said the eunuch was an assassin.

69
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,459
She must be afraid of being killed.

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,850
She's quite smart.

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,860
Do you think we need

72
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,060
to tell her

73
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,140
the whole story.

74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,180
I don't want to ruin your reputation.

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,700
There's no need.

76
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,620
You want to threaten Chen Youyou using this?

77
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,740
She is smart.

78
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,620
No matter what her purpose is,

79
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,300
she won't dare to do anything.

80
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,980
If she crosses the line,

81
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,340
just kill her.

82
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,340
Copy that.

83
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,340
Miss?

84
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,140
Today, you ran from east

85
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,500
to west in the city,

86
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,020
and then from south to north.

87
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,380
Right after a little break,

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,940
someone at the east gate asked for you.

89
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,660
Tiao, get to the point.

90
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,500
Here.

91
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,930
The butler from Lord Xian's Palace sent this apple.

92
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,930
Chen Youyou, you enjoyed yourself today?

93
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,450
You made a fuss in Castellan's Palace

94
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,260
and got married.

95
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,260
Most importantly,

96
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,740
you ruined my face.

97
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,860
We haven't settled that yet.

98
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,100
Your Highness,

99
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,050
if I offer a solution,

100
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,730
could you please

101
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,700
spare my father and Tiao?

102
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,060
Their lives depend on your performance.

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,460
Try your best to please Bai Li

104
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,610
and spy on him.

105
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,580
Chen Youyou!

106
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,780
Remember,

107
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,659
if you want to save your father,

108
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,250
you must be on the inside.

109
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,220
Who's there?

110
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,420
Chen Youyou?

111
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,180
What are you doing?

112
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,820
Make you satisfied and earn your trust.

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,020
My lord,

114
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,060
I'll help you with the clothes.

115
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,660
My lord,

116
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,410
you don't have to be shy

117
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,540
in front of me.

118
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,930
Chen Youyou,

119
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,940
are you out of your mind?

120
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,490
My lord, don't say that.

121
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,340
I didn't mean that.

122
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,140
Think about it.

123
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,780
We're so lucky to meet each other.

124
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,420
I just want to be closer to you.

125
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,970
Get out!

126
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,380
Chen Youyou!

127
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,020
Chen Youyou.

128
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,090
How dare you!

129
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,620
My lord, do you prefer

130
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,380
to be served by General Gu?

131
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,450
What do you want to say?

132
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,140
I just want to make you happy.

133
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,060
Nonsense!

134
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,140
How inappropriate!

135
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,020
My lord,

136
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,140
now that we are married,

137
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,460
I'll be honest with you.

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,620
I know

139
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,659
you don't trust me now.

140
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,100
We suddenly got married.

141
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,740
It's hard for the both of us to accept it.

142
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,500
But now,

143
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,420
we are under the same roof.

144
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,540
We see each other every day.

145
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,700
So,

146
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,260
I want

147
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,140
to be good to you.

148
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,900
You've performed this in front of the castellan.

149
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,690
No need to do that again.

150
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,580
I don't care why

151
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,659
you married me.

152
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,290
But I warn you,

153
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,340
don't let me find out.

154
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,100
Otherwise, you'll suffer the consequences.

155
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,490
You're too serious.

156
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,660
I don't have any bad intentions.

157
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,370
My lord?

158
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,340
Didn't you say you would help me with this?

159
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,940
Do it.

160
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,540
You think I'm afraid?

161
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,580
Isn't she afraid?

162
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,620
Guess I was wrong.

163
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,740
She wasn't testing me.

164
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,860
She really meant it.

165
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,300
You have a personal guard.

166
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,940
Why the charade?

167
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,540
I don't believe you dare to do anything to me.

168
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,740
My lord, you...

169
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,540
My lord, what did you do?

170
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,940
I hate slick people

171
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
with smart mouths.

172
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,460
That was your punishment.

173
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,380
Punishment?

174
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,260
Do you feel hot?

175
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,380
Is your heart beating faster?

176
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,130
This is a special poison.

177
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,460
The poisonous insect has entered your body.

178
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,740
You poisoned me?

179
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,860
I was married to you by the castellan!

180
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:09,980
Don't worry.

181
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,780
It won't kill you.

182
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,060
I said the insect is special,

183
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,170
because those who are poisoned can't lie.

184
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,740
Once they lie,

185
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,300
their hearts will beat faster.

186
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,700
The insect will feel it.

187
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,820
As a result, if you lie,

188
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,660
you will be devoured.

189
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,860
Don't scare me.

190
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,180
I've been to many places in past years.

191
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,100
I've never heard of such poison.

192
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,850
Then, have a try.

193

General Gu, don't take this wrongly.

200
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,260

203
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,340
Miss Chen,

204
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,780
to get the antidote,

205
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820

207
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,100
Do you have the antidote?

208
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
No.

209
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,020
But, you have two choices.

210
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,060

and leave Bai's Mansion.

214
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,580
Then, you will get the antidote.

215
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,180
I won't divorce him.

216
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,260
What's the second choice?

217
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,340
The second choice...

218
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,340

She's Lord Qiansui's wife, isn't she?

225
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,140
Yes. How long has she been running?

226
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,780
Yeah.

227
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,020
She looks smart.

228
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,980
Unfortunately, she married

229
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,900
someone who can't even be regarded as a real man.

230
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,260
She just got married and is suffering like this.

231
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,380
What a pity.

232
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,260

more ruthless than the way he poisoned me?

239
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,700

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,730
hate me?

575
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,140
That's none of your business.

576
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,180
You do hate me!

577
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,210
No, I don't.

578
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,180
I knew it. You're highly intelligent.

579
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,020
How could you not see

580
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,300
my love for you?

581
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,290
My lord,

582
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,220
your hand...

583
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,380
It's nothing.

584
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,300
Chen Youyou,

585
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,420
there's nothing else.

586
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,260
You should leave now.

587
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,820
Yes.

588
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,570
No, I haven't poured the milk yet.

589
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,700
Milk.

590
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,100
I'll get your clothes.

591
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,580
I...

592
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,620
I'll stay here for a while.

593
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,020
Chen Youyuo, get your head out of the clouds.

594
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,620
He is a eunuch!

595
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,220
The type who will kill without blinking.

596
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,780
Calm down.

597
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,620
This one...

598
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,500
is a bit old-fashioned.
