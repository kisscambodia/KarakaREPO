[Episode 4]

4
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,500
Have you heard that?

5
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,380
Yes, I have.

6
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,180
-It's true. -Yes, she came, too.

7
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,260
You must be Lord Bai's lovely wife.

8
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,410
You look no different from the painting.

9
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,890
Greetings, ladies.

10
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,940
Lovely wife?

11
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,260
She married a eunuch.

12
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,180
A nominal couple, that's all.

13
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,100
You are so humorous.

14
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,220
For small families,

15
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,140
even a nominal couple can enjoy dinner together.

16
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,740
Different from you

17
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,740
who came from extended and luxurious families,

18
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,220
I guess you have to line up

19
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,420
for dinner with your husband.

20
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,780
Marrying a eunuch,

21
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,170
why do you feel smug?

22
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,140
Precisely.

23
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,060
Right.

24
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,700
For you, a poor hoyden,

25
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,140
you have married up.

26
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,300
Actually, I am already satisfied

27
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,100
with the life that my Lord provides me

28
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,460
since I am fed and clothed.

29
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,180
Madam,

30
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,980
your clothes

31
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,170
must be last year's model.

32
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,340
Look at this.

33
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,170
My Lord customized it lately.

34
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,180
It took half a month to be made and delivered.

35
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,660
My Lord said

36
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,850
pink matched me the most.

37
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,700
As Eunuch Mastering the Seal waiting for castellan,

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,370
he didn't perform his duty

39
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,300
but used castellan's power

40
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,900
for private gain.

41
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,340
And you actually took it as glory.

42
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:01,820
Madam.

43
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,500
Exactly.

44
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,180
You'd better think twice.

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,060
My lord has always been diligent

46
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,980
and dutiful.

47
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,660
He dare neither seek private gains

48
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,980
nor neglect any order of castellan.

49
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,620
Please pick your words with care.

50
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,580
Madam.

51
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,100
My Lord.

52
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,700
You're here.

53
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,490
Come on.

54
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,620
By the way, these ladies are struck

55
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,940
on the clothes you customized for me.

56
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,300
How about recommending the dressmaker to them?

57
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,500
Sure, Madam.

58
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,100
Look at yourself.

59
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,740
You miss me so much only after a short while.

60
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,780
So annoying.

61
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,060
See you.

62
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,220
Look how smug she is.

63
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Why are you in a rush?

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,100
I haven't finished my acting.

65
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,970
Sit here still.

66
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,260
Don't run around anymore.

67
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,650
Please.

68
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,970
Let me drink a toast to you.

[Guanyu Palace]

70
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,530
This wine tastes good.

71
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,690
It's been a long time since I drank such good wine.

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,150
You look quite well.

73
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,060
Your Excellency,

74
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,860
I heard that Lord Bai is a master of swordplay.

75
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,980
Why not ask him to perform

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,540
a sword dance of Fuxian City with imperial bodyguards

77
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,980
to cheer us up?

78
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,290
Great. Great.

79
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,580
Bai Li, go perform with them.

80
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,020
Yes.

81
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,980
It's rare to see a eunuch perform sword dances.

82
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,380
One always wants to prove what he lacks.

83
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,420
Lord Bai just lacks manliness, doesn't he?

84
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,140
That's true.

85
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,140
-Look! Look! -Look at Lord Bai.

86
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,300
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

87
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,500
A eunuch has an Adam's Apple.

88
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,300
It must be the most weird thing in the world.

89
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,700
I heard that a few days ago, an assassin intruded into House of Respectful Affairs,

90
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,980
so Lord Bai didn't finish his examination.

91
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,660
Now he even has an Adam's Apple.

92
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,020
We cannot but

93
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,140
make a connection between these.

94
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,100
Why don't we

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,060
seize the day and check him?

96
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,060
Yes.

97
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:41,940
Yes.

98
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,060
Bai Li, what's wrong with that?

99
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,800
It's rare.

100
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,659
So weird.

101
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,850
It is really weird.

102
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,360
Yes.

103
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,940
Your Excellency,

104
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,100
that is not an Adam's Apple. Instead, it's a kind of laryngeal disease.

105
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,460
His Lord has been serving you all year long

106
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,740
and suffers from it due to excessive exhaustion.

107
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
It's not an Adam's Apple

108
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,500
but a sign of his loyalty.

109
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,140
The reason why his Lord always keeps reticent

110
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,700
is that he doesn't want to bother you with trifles.

111
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,060
Your Excellency, she's talking nonsense.

112
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
How can there be such a disease?

113
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,300
I've never heard of that.

114
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,020
That's easy. Imperial physician.

115
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,380
Your Excellency,

116
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,220
there is indeed a disease like that.

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,409
That's good.

118
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,500
Stop talking about that.

119
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,940
Continue the banquet.

120
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,060
Luckily, I've journeyed north and south with Chen Pingzhi

121
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,820
and have seen lots of weird diseases.

122
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,900
Oh no, the apple is coming again.

[Moon Pavilion]

124
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,260
Mrs. Zhao,

125
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,460
is that really okay?

126
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,100
You are still a little girl.

127
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,410
You won't understand even if I explain.

128
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,900
It's easy for a girl to pursue a man.

129
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,460
With the help of ambergris and me,

130
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,860
Lord Bai and Madam Bai

131
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,340
will surely become reconciled.

132
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,340
Miss is here.

133
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,780
Lord Bai.

134
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:30,900
Madam.

135
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,260
It's so late now. You must be hungry.

136
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,140
I specially prepared sweet soup for you.

137
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,100
Miss.

138
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,250
Madam, drink the soup while it's hot.

139
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,020
Or it would not taste that good.

140
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,860
Soup?

141
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,140
Drink it

142
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,700
and you will be reconciled with Lord Bai.

143
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,900
I don't want to be reconciled with him.

144
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,300
He has such a short fuse.

145
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,500
I dare not offend him.

146
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,460
Drink it, Madam.

147
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,620
It's delicious.

148
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,530
What happened?

149
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,780
It's so hot tonight.

150
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,180
General Gu?

151
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,500
Miss Chen.

152
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,860
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,220
Acting under his Lord's order,

154
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,140
I am going to send you away.

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,860
What should I do with you?

158
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,340
Who's there?

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,340
[Wind Booth]

160
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,780
My lord.

161
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,340
Mrs. Zhao,

162
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,580
why are you furtively hiding yourself here?

163
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,610
Madam Bai and you had some issues

164
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,220
so I was going to lend a hand.

165
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,620
I used

166
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,820
that drug.

167
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,180
Where is Chen Youyou?

168
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,940
Isn't Madam Bai inside?

169
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,220
Gu Tianhe! It's terrible!

170
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,980
As everything is all right,

171
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,220
why did Wu tell me a ghost story?

172
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,580
Who's there disguising as a ghost?

173
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,420
You...

174
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,860
you don't come over.

175
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,490
Youyou?

176
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,220
Help me!

177
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,420
Where is she?

178
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,660
She was in the carriage just now.

179
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,260
Look for her separately.

180
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,100
My lord,

181
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,900
what's done is done.

182
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,300
Why don't we seize the opportunity

183
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,700
and let her leave Bai's Mansion

184
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
to avoid following troubles?

185
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,890
When do I need

186
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,940
you to decide for me?

187
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,900
You said

188
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,820
you didn't want her to stay around, didn't you?

189
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,020
Never return

190
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
if you can't find her back.

191
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,140
My lord.

192
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,740
My Lord.

193
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,940
Do I misread him again?

194
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,180
Youyou.

195
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,820
Youyou.

196
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,220
You're awake.

197
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,420
Where am I?

198
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,010
This is the secret base for my snack research.

199
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,620
I didn't expect to invite you here in this way.

200
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,100
By the way, Youyou,

201
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,540
at a late night,

202
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,260
why are you in the wild alone?

203
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,420
Do you know how dangerous it is?

204
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:05,770
I...

205
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,420
was kicked out.

206
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,100
What?

207
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,820
How can Bai Li be like this?

208
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,220
How can he ignore your safety?

209
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,380
Yes.

210
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,220
I risked myself to get him out of a fix

211
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,530
but he still kicked me out.

212
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm pissed off.

213
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,140
Why

214
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,260
do I lose my breath?

215
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,180
Youyou,

216
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,890
why is your face so red?

217
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,340
Could it be that sweet soup?

218
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,820
Are you allergic?

219
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,420
Don't come over.

220
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,730
I...

221
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,900
I still have something to do. I have to go.

222
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,460
Youyou.

223
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,370
Let's go home.

224
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,060
Why do you come to me?

225
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,980
You drove me away, didn't you?

226
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,330
Let go!

227
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,420
Let go!

228
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,180
Let her go.

229
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,260
She doesn't want to go with you.

230
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,370
Let go.

231
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,340
It's you who should let go.

232
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,260
She is my wife.

233
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,660
Your Royal Highness, please behave yourself.

234
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Let go!

235
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,100
Let go of me!

236
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,660
Let go!

237
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:33,770
[Drug]

238
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:28,900
Go.

239
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,540
Put me down!

240
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,020
Put me down!

241
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,740
You put me down!

242
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:39,820
[Inn with Luck]

243
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,660
Don’t move.

244
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,860
So where are you going to abandon me?

245
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,140
I'll take you

246
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,060
home.

247
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,580
It's you who drove me away.

248
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:43,940
You...

249
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,580
Why did you come to me?

250
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,780
Put me down!

251
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,860
Put me down!

252
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,680
[Drug]

253
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,540
I want to go down.

254
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,160
Come on.

255
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,180
This way.

256
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,340
Let me go.

257
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,470
[Drug]

258
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,220
Chen Youyou.

259
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,500
Stop joking.

260
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,620
Am I joking?

261
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,740
You sent me away, didn't you?

262
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,330
You asked Gu Tianhe to hit my head

263
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,900
and it still hurts now.

264
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,780
It's so dangerous for me to fall off the carriage.

265
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,890
I almost died.

266
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,940
It's hot.

267
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,180
Get up.

268
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,020
Come on.

269
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,180
Don't be afraid.

270
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,820
My lord, your heart is beating wildly.

271
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,380
And mine too!

272
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,380
Be careful of fire

273
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,900
as it is dry.

274
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,200
[Drug]

275
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,450
Lord...Lord Qiansui.

276
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,660
I, I didn't see anything.

277
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,060
Go.

278
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,580
[Drug]

279
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,780
Let go of me!

280
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,580
Let go of me! Let go.

281
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,700
Why hasn't the epiphyllum blossomed yet?

282
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,500
Qingshu, stay calm.

283
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,540
Chen Youyou has just riled lord, hasn't she?

284
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,540
Why are they so intimate now?

285
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,300
Put me down!

286
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,540
My Lady,

287
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,740
stay calm.

288
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,290
My lord.

289
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:23,490
My lord.

290
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,490
How is Chen Youyou?

291
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,500
The imperial physician said

292
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,620
Miss Chen was okay.

293
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,220
Anything else?

294
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,500
And Miss Chen said...

295
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,140
she wouldn't blame me.

296
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,890
Anything else?

297
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,410
Anything else?

298
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,770
What else should there be?

299
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,220
Didn't she mention

300
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,450
anything about me?

301
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,620
No.

302
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,140
What things concerned you

303
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,460
should she mention?

304
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,050
Go.

305
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,420
Where should I go, my Lord?

306
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,660
What do you think?

307
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,700
Accept punishment at the same place.

308
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,380
Miss Chen.

309
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,500
Why are you here?

310
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,260
Mrs. Zhao is still watching outside.

311
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,380
I don’t want to drink her sweet soup again.

312
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,140
Is that drug's effect off?

313
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,740
Don't worry.

314
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,220
I won't do anything to you.

315
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,060
If I offend you again,

316
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,290
I might be murdered in the wild.

317
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,900
Do you feel better?

318
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,620
It hit me that I caught a cold.

319
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,060
I should not infect you.

320
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,140
I'll sleep outside.

321
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,580
Why doesn't he stop me?

322
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,780
I...I'll take the quilt.

323
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,500
What are you doing?

324
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,620
It's cold in the wood shed.

325
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,860
And you haven't recovered yet.

326
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,020
Stay here.

327
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,980
It's okay for me to stay.

328
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,810
But we should set three rules.

329
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,020
I allowed you to stay but you made a requirement again.

330
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,100
Then forget it.

331
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,780
Say it.

332
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,740
First,

333
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,820
no more threats.

334
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,660
OK.

335
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,980
Second,

336
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,380
no more expelling.

337
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:09,860
OK.

338
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,100
Third,

339
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,660
no more tantrums.

340
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:24,940
OK.

341
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,220
My lord.

342
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,940
For tonight,

343
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,250
you sleep here,

344
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,460
and I sleep there.

345
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,820
Forget it if you don't agree.

346
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,260
Anyway, I have been used to sleeping on a small bed...

347
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,980
OK.

348
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,380
Good night.

349
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,890
Don't think I will forgive you so easily.

350
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:47,440
[Wind Booth]

351
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,330
My lord,

352
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,380
Mrs. Zhao was in a hurry

353
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,140
to pack up and leave Bai's Mansion

354
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,140
in the early morning.

355
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,620
I asked her to leave.

356
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,460
Your Highness.

357
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,650
[Wind Booth]

358
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,260
Youyou,

359
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,180
Mrs. Zhao didn't behave herself.

360
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,420
She put you at risk last night.

361
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,300
So I've asked her to retire.

362
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,860
From now on,

363
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,420
if anyone dares to bully you,

364
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,580
I will surely teach him a lesson.

365
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,780
Does his Highness know

366
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,260
why Mrs. Zhao came to work in Bai's Mansion?

367
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,740
So he knew

368
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,380
it was I who invited Mrs. Zhao here.

369
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
I don’t care

370
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
your housework at all.

371
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,460
But Youyou is my friend.

372
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,260
I won't allow anyone to hurt her.

373
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,180
It's a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding.

374
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,860
Youyou.

375
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,780
I am devising a new snack

376
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,770
but I met some difficulties.

377
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,010
i hope you can teach me.

378
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,980
OK.

379
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,530
Chen Youyou,

380
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,140
you haven't recovered yet.

381
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,140
You should not run about.

382
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,060
I, I'm fine now.

383
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,260
Well,

384
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,540
have you cleaned the front yard?

385
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,020
In conflict with his Highness,

386
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,740
you're trying to vent your anger on me?

387
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,180
I've already cleaned it up.

388
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,700
Go. Let's go to the Bamboo House.

389
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:11,900
Chen Youyou.

390
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,540
[Wind Booth]

391
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,700
Yesterday you said you were moving to the wing-room, didn't you?

392
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,940
Now that Mrs. Zhao has left,

393
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,980
why don’t you move?

394
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,660
I knew it.

395
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,460
Tiao.

396
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,780
Take all my stuff

397
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,180
to the wing-room now.

398
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:26,900
Yes.

399
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,660
Let's go.

400
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,660
You welshed on your promise.

401
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,820
You were as cruel as a wolf.

402
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,220
You quit love with hate.

403
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,460
-You put on sanctified airs. -You...

404
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,420
Youyou,

405
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,570
is he always harsh on you?

406
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,300
Yes!

407
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,460
Yes.

408
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,940
Anyway, stay away from him.

409
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,780
Whoever gets close to him will be unlucky.

410
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,980
If you don't want to see him later,

411
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,580
you can stay here.

412
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,060
OK.

413
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,380
Youyou.

414
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,420
Youyou...Youyou.

415
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,300
Would you like

416
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,700
a bigger hammer?

417
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,060
Sorry.

418
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,940
I somehow forgot myself.

419
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,370
Please don't mind it.

420
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,100
It doesn't matter.

421
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,500
If you feel bad,

422
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,660
just vent your anger.

423
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,580
With me,

424
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,890
you can just be yourself.

425
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,100
Thank you.

426
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Beat you. Beat you.

427
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:31,930
By the way,

428
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,980
there are a lot of ingredients in the forest.

429
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,100
How about

430
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,770
picking some fresh vegetables and fruits?

431
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,180
Sure.

432
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,380
Here you are.

433
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,490
Thank you.

434
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,220
Are you tired?

435
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,340
Sit down there and have a rest.

436
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,100
OK.

437
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,020
Slow down.

438
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,860
You too.

439
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,700
Youyou.

440
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,140
I've heard a joke.

441
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,140
Once upon a time, there was an earthworm.

442
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,220
It went out for a walk.

443
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,940
While it was walking,

444
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,500
it crashed into a crab.

445
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,060
A crab?

446
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,860
The earthworm was mad and questioned the crab,

447
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,220
"Are you blind?"

448
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,020
But the crab felt innocent,

449
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,540
"I am not blind.

450
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
I'm a crab."

451
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,620
It's not funny at all.

452
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,300
Smell it.

453
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,540
Can you smell a faint scent

454
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,460
from this ginger?

455
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,740
This kind of wild ginger

456
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,660
is hard to pick.

457
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,540
But it tastes fresh and crispy.

458
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,260
It is a good ingredient.

459
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,060
Besides, it’s said that it can cure cold and headache.

460
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,420
So it should be that domain lotus in the poem.

461
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,780
Poem?

462
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,180
Domain lotus?

463
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,570
It is read that

464
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,460
Yan Emperor carried this edition forward and thought it precious.

465
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,220
After a harsh time, he got domain lotus and was able to survive.

466
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,770
Even Shen Nung suffered hardships to get it

467
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,620
and continued his life with it.

468
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,740
It's so precious.

469
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,540
Thanks to you,

470
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,620
I have the chance to see it.

471
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,380
Your Highness, you're so erudite.

472
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,460
You know so much things.

473
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,900
You must have read a lot.

474
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,060
Unlike me,

475
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,770
I am almost illiterate.

476
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,380
But your horizon is still broader than mine.

477
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,620
Youyou.

478
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,860
The world is vast.

479
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,300
Every thing you know

480
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,460
and every journey you had

481
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,900
is what you've read.

482
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,460
It's my first time to have received such praise.

483
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,980
That is a fact.

484
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,500
It is a pity that they don't have a good taste.

485
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,260
You're right.

486
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,580
Let's continue the picking.

487
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,540
OK.

488
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,370
By the way,

489
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,460
we can try to

490
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,700
use this wild ginger in the snack.

491
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,660
There might be a special flavor.

492
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,670
[Bai's Mansion]

493
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,980
He really allowed Tiao to pack my stuff up.

494
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,700
Why didn't he stop Tiao?

495
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,860
Youyou.

496
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,220
Miss Jiang.

497
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,570
I've heard what happened

498
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,700
last night.

499
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,090
I didn’t expect Mrs. Zhao

500
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,700
to have played such a trick.

501
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,020
And General Gu

502
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,220
actually left you alone

503
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,060
in the wild.

504
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,820
For an ordinary girl,

505
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,540
she might have lost her chastity.

506
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,930
No need to worry about me, Miss Jiang.

507
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,940
I didn't meet any accident.

508
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,260
But Miss Jiang,

509
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,380
you should not behave like those yentas

510
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,660
and backbite me.

511
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,420
Come on.

512
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,860
Have some green tea

513
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,060
to reduce your internal heat.

514
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,340
I almost forgot it.

515
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,820
This is

516
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
the nutritious soup I specially cooked for you.

517
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,020
I used

518
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,620
precious herbs that his Lord gave me before.

519
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,260
After all this,

520
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,140
you should take good care of yourself.

521
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,290
Now that his Lord gave these herbs to you,

522
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,580
you should nourish yourself with them.

523
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,700
I still have a lot.

524
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,260
Don't worry for me.

525
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,940
On the contrary,

526
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,500
you are new in the mansion

527
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,060
and have no idea about his Lord's personality.

528
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,460
It’s common for you

529
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,620
to annoy him.

530
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,140
Miss,

531
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,860
you should be more careful.

532
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,100
But

533
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,220
if anything similar happens again,

534
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,180
you can come to me.

535
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,060
After all, I've known his Lord for years.

536
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,380
Somehow,

537
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,980
I weigh with him.

538
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,380
Indeed.

539
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,740
You weigh some weight.

540
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,580
My father used to be an official of Fuxian City

541
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,340
but was set up by villains.

542
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,140
The Jiang family then came down

543
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,340
and I got lost.

544
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,730
Thanks to his Lord's help,

545
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,540
I was survived.

546
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,460
His Lord is considerate

547
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,380
and takes good care of me.

548
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,100
Of course I know his regard.

549
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,180
It is a pity that

550
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,940
there is

551
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,660
an unbridgeable gap

552
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,810
between him and me.

553
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,500
A gap?

554
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,700
I see.

555
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,450
This gap

556
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,900
must be that He.

557
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,140
He and his Lord...they two...

558
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,620
Youyou, you misunderstood it.

559
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,940
Gu Tianhe is nothing but a guard.

560
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,780
I’ve lived with his Lord in Bai's Mansion for years.

561
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,500
I know him better than you do.

562
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,540
His Lord once

563
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,500
arranged a blind date for Gu Tianhe last year.

564
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,100
But General Gu was so stubborn

565
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,900
that the girl felt wronged and left.

566
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,060
General Gu does look like

567
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,700
a stubborn man.
