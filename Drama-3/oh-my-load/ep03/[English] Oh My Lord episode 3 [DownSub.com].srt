[Episode 3]

00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,260
Why are you lying in my bed?

5
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,740
My lord,

6
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,139
since castellan has married me off to you,

7
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,300
we should share the same room.

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,660
I'm not used to sleeping with others.

9
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,660
But Mrs. Zhao and the others

10
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,220
are still watching from the door.

11
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,260
I even set up a gap.

12
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,220
We have our own spaces to sleep in, and

13
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,900
we won't disturb each other.

14
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,180
My lord, I'm not a restless sleeper.

16
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,460
Mrs. Zhao,

17
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,140
it has been so long.

18
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,730
Why is it so quiet?

19
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,410
Did something happen?

20
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,060
Calm down.

21
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,570
You are still a young girl.

22
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,700
When you get married,

23
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,660
you'll know what is happening.

24
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,980
Go!

25
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,820
Let's go!

26
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,340
Go!

27
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,020
My lord, what are you doing?

28
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,420
Put me down!

29
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,220
Let me go!

30
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,940
My lord, you can't...

31
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,020
My lord, how can you do this!

32
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Let me out!

33
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,220
If you keep making noises,

34
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,500
I'll throw you out.

35
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,740
My lord!

36
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,980
Good night.

37
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,580
It's so dark...

38
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,220
Don't come over.

39
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,660
Don't come over.

40
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,060
I'm not afraid of you!

41
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,900
I'm not afraid of you.

42
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,659
Don't be afraid.

43
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,420
Good boy.

44
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,020
Imperial physician Su has been kind to me.

45
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,100
Even if I risk going against the world,

46
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,300
I will keep his offspring safe.

47
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,730
Don't let anyone know

48
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,220
you are a boy.

49
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,780
From now on,

50
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,860
I will be your master.

51
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,540
Understand?

52
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,220
Don't cry.

53
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,620
Don't cry.

54
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,540
Master,

55
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,660
where are you?

56
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,260
You're drooling and talking in your sleep.

57
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,260
Didn't you say you are not a restless sleeper?

58
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,210
Well, you still have some conscience!

59
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,060
I always know how to be grateful.

60
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,700
Since you gave me a pillow,

61
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,940
I'll repay you.

62
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,290
I'm really good at this!

63
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,700
Youyou, you're so nice to me.

64
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,540
You even sewed a wrist strap for me.

65
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,420
I won't get angry at you anymore.

66
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,620
I am a generous person, so

67
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,820
I won't mind it.

68
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,540
What if you do it again...

69
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,980
Then, I'll give you all my money!

70
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,980
This material is so good.

71
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,540
Isn't it a pity to throw it away?

72
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,260
Why do you look stern, my lord?

73
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,220
Nothing!

74
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,260
Are you unhappy?

75
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,740
Eat!

76
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,140
Why are you only eating porridge?

77
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:51,940
You...

78
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,700
My lord,

79
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,980
you smiled.

80
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Here you are.

81
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,900
This is how you put it on.

82
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,220
Look.

83
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,820
My lord,

84
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,100
don't always look so grim.

85
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,620
Actually, you look nice

86
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,980
when you smile.

87
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,060
Eat more!

88
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,860
Eat more!

89
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,620
Did you hear me?

90
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,300
-My lord! -Miss!

91
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,860
Bad news, Lord Xian is here!

92
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,820
Bai Li always cares for me,

93
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,420
but he doesn't dare to come in.

94
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,620
It has always been like this for years.

95
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,380
Miss, don't mind it.

96
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,300
It must be Chen Youyou who is following

97
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,970
and pestering him.

98
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Shameless!

99
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,660

Let me introduce them myself.

116
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,540
Come!

117
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,740
I guarantee this herb from the snowy region...

118
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,140
Good!

119
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,580
Aren't all of you going to cheer for

120
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,220
His Highness's gifts?

121
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,860
Yes!

122
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,460
Very good!

Please calm down, Your Highness.

If I

126
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,540
said anything wrong just now,

127
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,620
please forgive me, Your Highness.

128
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,460
For the sake of the castellan.

129
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,220
You did nothing wrong.

130
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,780
Don't kneel down.

131
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,660
So, you mean...

132
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,290
it's my fault?

133
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,500
Your Highness,

134
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,460
I don't mean that.

135
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,140
It's just that my wife is so timid that

136
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,140
she was scared just by Your Highness's stare.

137
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,530
Please calm down, Your Highness.

138
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,890
She is timid.

139
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,580
But, you are bold.

140
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,660
I came to give you gifts, but

141
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
you made me upset?

142
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,980
I appreciate your kindness, Your Highness.

143
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,580
As for these things...

144
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,260
What?

145
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,740
Well...

146
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,060
Of course, we will keep these gifts.

147
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,060
I will put Your Highness's kindness

148
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,780
to good use.

149
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,620
These would make our relationship sweeter

150
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,860
and better.

151
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,580
We won't let you and

152
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,500
castellan down,

153
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,610
am I right?

154
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,460
You...

155
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,340
Let's go!

156

[Bai's Mansion]

157
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,740
Your Highness.

158
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,580
Drawing.

159
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,170
I'm so pissed.

160
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,420
What is this drawing?

161
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,660
What I want is

162
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,940
the drawing of an embarrassed Bai Li to humiliate him.

163
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,820
This is clearly about Chen Youyou and Bai Li being

164
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,700
lovey-dovey!

165
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,780
Lovey-dovey?

166
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,140
She is right.

167
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,460
The better and more loving their relationship is,

168
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,540
the more useful

169
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,420
Chen Youyou will be to me.

170
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,860
This matter must be

171
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,860
known by everyone in Fuxian City.

172
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,460
Yes.

173
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,860
Also, tell Mrs. Zhao that

174
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,300
this marriage

175
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,580
is different from others.

176
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,700
Sometimes,

177
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,780
we need to use extreme measures.

178
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,580
Since you're already in trouble,

179
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
why did you get involved in this?

180
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,380
If I don't do it myself,

181
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,940
our difficulties

182
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,500
will be more than these.

183
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,500
Miss, do you have any good idea?

184
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,780
Tiao,

185
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
pick out the jewelries and jades.

186
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,380
Then, pawn them at a suitable pawnshop.

187
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,450
Money is more realistic.

188
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,740
Miss,

189
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,660
the east side pawnshop's owner is the most honest.

190
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,220
The one in the south is the closest to us.

191
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
The one in the north gives the highest price.

192
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
The one in the west...

193
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,780
Tiao,

194
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,460
get to the point!

195
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,620
Miss,

196
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,860
what about these herbs?

197
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,610
These herbs are not worth any money.

198
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Just take care of it.

199
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,300
Just take care of it?

200
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,980
My lord!

201
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,940
My lord!

202
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,530
I just cleaned up your room

203
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
and found this.

204
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,620
It's good.

205
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,180
Miss Chen.

206
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,780
Miss Chen is so meticulous to you.

207
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,580
She even sewed you a wrist strap.

208
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,620
It's nothing.

209
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,100
Miss Chen...

210
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,140
still protected you in front of Lord Xian today.

211
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,020
As a couple,

212
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,060
it's normal.

213
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,380
Miss Chen...

214
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,260
take cares of your daily necessities

215
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,020
and even makes supper for you.

216
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,410
She got nothing else to do.

217
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,780
My lord,

218
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,180
I think Ms. Chen treats you differently.

219
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,820
I think...

220
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,380
she covets your beauty.

221
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,780
Stop thinking.

222
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,780
Go and receive your punishment.

223
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,010
Receive punishment for this?

224
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,820
Come back!

225
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,900
My lord,

226
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,860
you agree with what I said, right?

227
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,420
How is the investigation?

228
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,660
Lord Wang Renhou

229
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,340
has no relatives in his hometown.

230
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,300
I didn't find any useful clues.

231
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
But I did find out that

232
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
a year ago,

233
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,380
he sent a letter to

234
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,420
his distant uncle-in-law.

235
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,580
A letter?

236
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,290
So, we deducted that

237
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,140
Lord Wang is still alive.

238
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,940
I've sent someone to investigate it.

239
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,730
Tell me immediately if you have any news.

240
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,220
Yes.

241
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,100
Go and receive your punishment.

242
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,580
Still?

243
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,180
I'll go then.

244
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,220
My lord,

245
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,020
one more thing.

246
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,630
[Wind Booth]

247
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,020
Miss Chen sure is meticulous to you.

248
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,020
She even sewed you a wrist strap.

249
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,300
I think

250
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,579
she covets your beauty.

251
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,089
Lord Xian made my lord upset.

252
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,740
With so much money,

253
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,450
I hope that he can be happier.

254
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,460
Hide it first

255
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,100
and give him a surprise.

256
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,980
My lord!

257
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,850
[Wind Booth]

258
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:46,980
My lord,

259
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
I have good news...

260
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:54,980
My goodness!

261
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,330
He got so upset by Lord Xian that his skin is breaking out.

262
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,300
Make sense.

263
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,820
I would have exploded if I were him.

264
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,500
Are you done?

265
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,660
Yes.

266
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,140
Don't move.

267
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,420
Don't move.

268
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,380
Don't move.

269
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,060
Don't move. Be gentle.

270
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,540
My lord!

271
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,380
My lord!

272
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,660
Be gentle.

273
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,140
My lord!

274
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,540
Why is everyone going crazy?

275
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,140
Finally, it's untangled!

276
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,380
Gu Tianhe, what are you talking about?

277
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,540
My lord,

278
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,220
the chicken coop at the south of the west wall of the east yard.

279
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,180
Tiao, she...

280
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,660
The point is she has gone crazy!

281
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,020
She has gone crazy?

282
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,980
Miss.

283
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,220
Miss, you're here.

284
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
Tiao, what are you...

285
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,340
Well...

286
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,380
Well...

287
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,220
Come here!

288
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,940
Come here!

289
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,740
Come here!

290
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,540
Stop!

291
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,940
That's what happened.

292
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,140
I have to catch the chickens.

293
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,420
General Gu, come and help.

294
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,420
I…

295
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,340
Stop!

296
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,620
You can do it!

297
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,290
You can do it!

298
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,700
You can do it.

299
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,860
Come back!

300
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,660
Right here.

301
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,730
Here!

302
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,540
My lord.

303
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,660
I must catch you this time.

304
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,060
Be careful, my lord!

305
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,100
Did I make him angry again?

306
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,250
[Wind Booth]

307
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,900
My lord!

308
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,300
My lord,

309
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,250
you're still up?

310
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,660
Let me apply the medicine for you.

311
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,250
Don't move.

312
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,770
It may hurt a little.

313
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,180
Hang in there.

314
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,010
My lord,

315
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,820
I'm sorry for today.

316
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,260
The mess in the mansion is

317
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,460
all because of me.

318
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,620
I asked Tiao to use the herbs to feed the chicken.

319
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,020
You can beat or punish me,

320
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,820
as long as you don't shoot me

321
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,060
with an arrow like last time.

322
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,100
By the way,

323
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,700
I sold the gifts.

324
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,660
Here is the money.

325
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,260
Here you go.

326
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,140
[Five hundred taels of silver]

327
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,820
Since it's a newlywed gift,

328
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,180
you can keep it.

329
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,740
Really?

330
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,260
You're really so beautiful and kind.

331
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,580
I made this

332
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,090
bitter tea to cool down the heat.

333
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,020
My lord, try it.

334
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,980
Who told you I'm heaty?

335
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,260
You are.

336
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,740
Look at your chin,

337
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,900
such a big pimple!

338
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,060
You...

339
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,540
What...

340
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,690
is that?

341
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,220
My lord,

342
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,380
is this...

343
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,580
for me?

344
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,500
You can sleep here from now on.

345
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,050
My lord, wait for me.

346
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,620
What are you playing now?

347
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:11,280
[Wind Booth]

348
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,100
My lord!

349
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,570
My lord!

350
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,620
My lord, I'm here!

351
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,900
Here!

352
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,580
Chen Youyou,

353
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,860
what are you doing up there?

354
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,740
My lord, come up!

355
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,050
Come on.

356
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,660
This is my secret recipe.

357
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,250
I've never told anyone about it.

358
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,860
There are only a few mouths of watermelon that are the sweetest.

359
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,090
It also needs to be frozen with well water for several hours.

360
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:32,860
Have a taste!

361
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:41,940
Is it sweet?

362
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,580
In life,

363
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,020
there are a lot of worries.

364
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,820
But, as long as you eat something sweet,

365
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,340
you'll feel better.

366
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,860
My lord, do you know that

367
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,980
when I was young, my family was poor.

368
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,500
I starved often.

369
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,940
One time, my father gave me something sweet.

370
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,260
Then, I realized that sweet

371
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,010
is such a wonderful taste.

372
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,860
From then on,

373
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,580
as long as I eat sweet,

374
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,100
I feel

375
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,300
there's nothing I can't do.

376
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,060
So,

377
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,340
don't be angry

378
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,180
for someone worthless,

379
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,260
okay?

380
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,930
Give me your hand.

381
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,810
Give it to me.

382
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,540
What?

383
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,900
What?

384
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,060
How dare you sneak around and eat?

385
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,330
What did I teach you?

386
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,500
You can only be respected after

387
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,660
you survive the bitterness of life.

388
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,460
Do you realize your mistake?

389
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,580
Yes,

390
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,180
I won't do it again.

391
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,260
My lord, make a wish!

392
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,660
When I was young, my father said

393
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,180
if eyelash falls, I should make a wish immediately.

394
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,020
It works!

395
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,620
Childish!

396
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,420
Forget it.

397
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,860
I'll make a wish for you then.

398
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,900
Wishing you

399
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,940
happiness every day!

400
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,540
[Maple Hall]

401
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,300
[Wind Booth]

402
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,260
My lord, I...

403
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,140
I'll head back first.

404
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,900
[Wind Booth]

405
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,220
No good night for today?

406
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,420
Good night?

407
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,580
Good night.

408
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,540
Why is he so nice suddenly?

409
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,500
When he held me just now,

410
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,300
I felt safe.

411
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,460
Did he hold me with his left hand

412
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,220
or right hand?

413
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,730
Why is my heart beating so fast?

414
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,620
What am I thinking?

415
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,770
He is Lord Qiansui, an eunuch!

416
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,500
No, no!

417
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,460
Chen Youyou, go to bed.

418
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:20,260
[Wind Booth]

419
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,750
[Wind Booth]

420
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,820
Miss Chen,

421
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,380
next time, you can clean when

422
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,140
my lord is not around.

423
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
He is allergic to dust.

424
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,980
Go, go!

425
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,980
My lord, are you alright?

426
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,700
How about I call the imperial physician?

427
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,140
It's not me who's in trouble.

428
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,580
Let's go.

429
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,260
My lord,

430
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,860
there's a lot of dust recently.

431
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,500
I made some sweet soup to clear your lungs.

432
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,220
Thank you.

433
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,250
I still have work to do.

434
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,100
Chen Youyou, what are you thinking?

435
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,940
You better clean the house quickly,

436
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,460
so he won't sneeze again.

437
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,180
Why is there a secret chamber?

438
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,940
Why are there no names

439
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,780
on these spirit tablets?

440
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,450
I'm sorry.

441
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,660
I didn't mean to offend you.

442
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,100
I didn't mean to offend you.

443
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,340
Chen Youyou, what are you doing?

444
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,540
I'm sorry,

445
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,420
I didn't mean it.

446
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,860
Who allowed you to search my things?

447
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,130
You are such a sneaky woman.

448
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,500
I just want to

449
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,460
clean the room.

450
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,460
Get out!

451
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,050
I'm not stealing anything!

452
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
I just want to clean the dust inside!

453
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,900
Never step in my room again!

454
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,020
But...

455
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,500
Well,

456
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,540
Mrs. Zhao is still in the mansion...

457
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,100
Get out!

458
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,140
I already apologized.

459
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,900
I said I didn't mean it!

460
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,300
Why are you so fierce?

461
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,740
My lord!

462
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,580
Who dares to make a scene here?

463
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,740
My lord,

464
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,730
castellan arranged a banquet and

465
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,780
requested the attendance of the family.

466
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,900
The family...

467
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,180
ran away?

468
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,280
[Bai's Mansion]

469
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,100
My lord,

470
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,900
we've been planning this for so many years.

471
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,860
We can't afford to make any mistakes now.

472
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,820
Or, I'll just...

473
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,140
She won't be able to figure it out.

474
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,580
Maybe

475
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,980
I shouldn't have kept her by my side.

476
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
I see.

477
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,220
But, if she's not with me,

478
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,900
where can she go?
