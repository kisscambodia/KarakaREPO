[Huilan Hall]

5
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,860
Madam De.

6
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,420
A lone green stem,

7
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,020
two shadows of red.

8
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,820
Hurry!

9
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,060
Open it and let me see.

10
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,020
Are the twin lotus flowers as spiritual

11
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,300
as you said?

12
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,290
Bai,

13
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,020
why are you being so mysterious?

14
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,500
Madam De can't wait any longer,

15
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,300
open it now.

16
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,420
Koi fish?

17
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,940
Madam De wants to see the lotus.

18
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,850
No!

19
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:03,820
My lord,

20
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,500
I think...

21
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
Madam De cares more about

22
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,460
the meaning of the twin lotus flowers.

23
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,780
What do you mean?

24
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,579
My lord, think about it.

25
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,700
No matter how beautiful a flower blooms,

26
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,820
it will wither someday.

27
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,450
What if that day comes, and

28
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,060
Madam De holds you accountable for?

29
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,260
What will you do?

30
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,900
Here.

31
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,100
Do you think we're blind?

32
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,410
-Are these twin lotus flowers? -What twin lotus flowers?

33
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,820
Isn't this a water tank?

34
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,660
Bai Li,

35
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,780
how dare you!

36
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,100
Madam De, please calm down.

37
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,579
Please look carefully.

38
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,579
Flowers bloom and wither.

39
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm worried

40
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,100
when the flowers wither,

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,340
they may make you upset.

42
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,860
So, I present you with

43
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,490
the twin lotus flowers that will never wither.

44
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,660
Madam, look.

45
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,300
The lotus tank is visually intermingled yet picturesque.

46
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,490
Put it in the imperial palace, and

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,380
you can see it every day.

48
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,660
These green leaves and koi fishes represent fun,

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,460
symbolize auspice.

50
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,570
If it is placed in the imperial palace,

51
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,100
it will bring spiritual energy.

52
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,700
What a joke!

53
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,100
Bai,

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,620
you can really defend yourself.

55
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,940
I think you broke the twin lotus flowers, so

56
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,180
you use this fake flower as an alternative.

57
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,940
Madam De...

58
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,900
won't be fooled by your little trick.

59
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,380
My lord, think about it.

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,380
Twin lotus flowers are so rare.

61
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,659
Once you do this,

62
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,300
you give Madam De hope.

63
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,340
Even in a place where there is no life.

64
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,170
Once the master has hope,

65
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,420
the spiritual energy comes along with it!

66
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,650
Madam De,

67
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,380
twin lotus flowers are hard to find.

68
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,940
It's even harder to find like-minded people.

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,330
I believe that being pure-hearted is efficacious.

70
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,820
If Madam De still wishes to admire twin lotus flowers,

71
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,820
you can try planting this seed yourself.

72
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,340
If the twin lotus flowers bloom in the imperial palace one day,

73
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,380
the late castellan must have

74
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,570
felt your longing.

75
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Bai is indeed the most trusted person in this city.

76
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,580
This never withering twin lotus flowers,

77
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,020
I like it very much.

78
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,860
Tomorrow is the beam raising ceremony.

79
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,340
I want to see this yard filled with twin lotus flowers.

80
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,580
Don't miss the auspicious time.

81
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,260
Yes.

82
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,290
[Lord Xian's Palace]

83
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,260
How absurd!

84
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
He fooled her

85
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,300
with just a few tanks.

86
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,820
Your Highness,

87
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,020
eyebrows.

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,210
You go to Bai's Mansion again and

89
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,700
find Chen Youyou.

90
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,340
Tell her...

91
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,420
if Bai Li

92
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,540
appears at Madam De's imperial palace tomorrow,

93
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,660
I'll kill Chen Pingzhi immediately.

94
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,140
I've picked the flowers.

95
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,740
Why is this still all I have left?

96
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,820
What should I do?

97
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,730
My lord,

98
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,500
the lotus tanks are ready.

99
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,659
All we need is to send them to the palace tomorrow.

100
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,730
Miss Chen is quite smart.

101
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,610
She accidentally broke the flower,

102
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,420
but prepared and

103
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,900
thought of a better way for you.

104
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,780
Of course!

105
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,260
She is my girl.

106
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,460
I mean

107
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,420
she has been in Bai's Mansion for more than three months.

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
She knows more or less about

109
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,780
the affairs in the palace.

110
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,260
She learned to be smart.

111
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,140
Be careful.

112
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,260
Are you alright?

113
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,340
Miss.

114
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,820
Youyou,

115
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,340
what a coincidence.

116
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,980
I made some flower tea.

117
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,940
Do you want some?

118
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,540
Don't mention flowers to me.

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,220
I can't hear this word now.

120
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,860
You don't like tea?

121
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,620
I made other dishes as well.

122
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,220
Would you like to go back with me

123
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,020
and try them out?

124
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,220
Green tea?

125
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,220
I'm afraid I need to let you down.

126
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,540
My stomach is weak.

127
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,820
I can't drink such high-quality tea.

128
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,500
Early this morning,

129
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,460
I sent soup noodle to my lord,

130
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,460
but he didn't eat it.

131
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,860
Now, you too refuse to drink my tea.

132
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,380
Did I do something wrong?

133
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,460
So this is what you want to ask.

134
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,020
My lord just doesn't want you to overwork yourself.

135
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,850
I knew it he cares about me.

136
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,370
Miss Jiang,

137
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,660
a noble lady like you

138
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,580
should rest more.

139
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,460
He cares about you a lot,

140
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,020
so don't make him worry.

141
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,180
Miss Jiang,

142
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,860
you told me last time...

143
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,420
if I have any questions, I can ask you.

144
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,060
Does it still count?

145
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,500
What's your question?

146
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,980
Miss Jiang has been with my lord for a long time.

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,419
You must know him well!

148
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,179
What are some of his

149
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,380
daily likes?

150
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,540
Normally...

151
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,220
other than eating soup noodles and drinking flower tea,

152
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,900
he also likes to drink liquor.

153
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,300
Very much.

154
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,700
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

155
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,340
Miss.

156
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,540
Miss Jiang is so nice.

157
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,420
She told you everything

158
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,700
once you asked her.

159
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,460
But,

160
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,420
does my lord really like drinking?

161
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,140
I've never seen him drinking

162
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,610
even once since I came here.

163
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,730
Are you stupid?

164
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,780
Judging from Miss Jiang's personality,

165
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,420
she must be telling us the opposite.

166
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,500
I guess

167
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,380
my lord can't really drink.

168
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,340
Let's go!

169
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,290
Go!

170

[Calming Hall]

171
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,860
I've been making you angry a lot lately.

172
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,060
To apologize,

173
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,500
I sincerely invite you to the courtyard to chat a little.

174
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,770
My lord!

175
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,420
I wish you

176
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,420
to take the lead,

177
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
to have a successful life,

178
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,740
to swim in water like three fishes,

179
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
and to be blessed like four pigs.

180

Today is not my birthday, right?

181
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,460
Besides,

182
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,690
to swim in water like three fishes and to be blessed like four pigs...

183
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,300
I don't think there are such phrases.

184
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,180
It doesn't matter.

185
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,700
What matters is that

186
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,060
do you remember

187
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,740
what day is today?

188
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,380
What day?

189
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,370
Today is the 100th day of our wedding.

190
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,220
So,

191
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,340
this thing...

192
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,860

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,220
No, no!

384
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,780
My lord,

385
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,620
what on earth

386
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,620
is Miss Chen up to?

387
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,900
Why did she go back?

388
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
For my conscience,

389
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,100
I had better think of another way.

390
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,830
[Secret Letter to Lord Qiansui]

391
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,460
My... my... my...

392
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,900
My lord, I...

393
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,300
I know

394
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,650
you drank too much last night, so

395
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,300
I came to visit you.

396
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,580
Do you need

397
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,060
hangover soup?

398
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,060
Is it only hangover soup?

399
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,410
I'm drunk.

400
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,940
I've been drunk for a long time.

401
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,860
I'll go prepare it for you now!

402
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,300
Weird!

403
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,860
He looks sober.

404
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,890
Why does he still want to drink the hangover soup?

405
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:46,860
Go home.

406
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,780
Bai's Mansion is your home.

407
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,580
Don't always run out when you're free.

408
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,300
Should I be honest

409
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,740
to my lord about my dad?

410
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,060
Chen Pingzhi?

411
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,900
Are you sure?

412
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,860
This father and daughter both

413
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
are troublesome.

414
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,020
My lord, I think

415
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,340
Why don't you...

416
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,140
I'll stop you there.

417
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,260
My lord!

418
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,700
Didn't you say she is a meticulous person

419
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,540
when she sewed a wrist strap for me?

420
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,740
She...

421
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,620
She's just faking it.

422
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,260
Didn't you say

423
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,700
she protected me in front of Lord Xian?

424
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,300
She's just afraid

425
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,100
to get in trouble.

426
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,820
Didn't you say she took care of my daily necessities

427
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,900
and even made supper?

428
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,090
My lord!

429
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,020
She has evil intentions!

430
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,410
Didn't you say she covet my beauty?

431
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,300
My lord, I think this is true.

432
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,090
I don't think so anymore.

433
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:48,860
My lord,

434
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,340
what should we do with Chen Pingzhi?

435
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,260
I have my own plan.

436
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,000
[Qingming House]

437
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,660
Chen Youyou,

438
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,540
just wait to collect your father's body.

439
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,700
No, Your Highness!

440
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,700
Please show mercy.

441
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,460
Your Highness,

442
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,780
here's the apple sauce.

443
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,700
It's chopped to such small chunks!

444
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,340
No, don't chop it.

445
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,220
Your Highness, I've broken the flowers and drank the liquor.

446
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,850
But, I didn't expect him to be so good at drinking.

447
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,940
Please give me another chance.

448
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,460
But, you seem to enjoy drinking very much.

449
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,220
No, no.

450
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,940
I'm not happy!

451
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,180
How can I be happy

452
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,300
if I didn't do what you asked?

453
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,330
Your Highness, please give me more time.

454
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,780
I promise you will be satisfied.

455
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,460
How?

456
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,460
Three days.

457
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,500
Just three days.

458
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,660
I promise he won't get to finish the imperial palace as he wishes.

459
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,980
Just three days.

460
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,900
Okay.
