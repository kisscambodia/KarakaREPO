[Episode 15]

4
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,780
Once upon a time,

5
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,660
there was a little wild cat

6
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,889
who was always alone.

7
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,260
In order not to get bullied by others,

8
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,300
it sharpened

9
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,140
its claws.

10
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,660
Everyone was afraid of it.

11
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,850
But one day,

12
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,579
a girl appeared.

13
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,660
Although the cat was not easy to deal with,

14
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
the girl

15
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,490
treated it well.

16
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,860
She gave it the sweetest watermelon,

17
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,100
warm clothes to wear,

18
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,660
and showed it the brightest stars.

19
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,700
Her kindness

20
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
made the small cat

21
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,260
happy for the first time.

22
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,460
Gradually,

23
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,900
the little cat

24
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,980
got used to being patted

25
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,220
and hugged.

26
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,420
But one day,

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,490
it woke up

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,620
and the girl had disappeared.

29
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,380
She stole its heart.

30
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,020
It didn't know why.

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,820
But it knew

32
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
that without the girl,

33
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,890
its life

34
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,180
would be colorless.

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,700
So it looked for her.

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,820
Kept looking and looking.

37
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,940
It crossed the forest

38
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,380
and kept looking for her.

39
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,579
Kept looking and looking.

40
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,860
It crossed the hill,

41
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,660
and kept looking and looking for her.

42
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,380
[River]

43
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,180
It crossed the river.

44
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,829
[River]

45
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,020
Finally,

46
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,940
it found the little girl.

47
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,610
It told itself

48
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,340
this time,

49
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,380
no matter what,

50
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,020
it would never let her leave.

51
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,780
You stole my heart,

52
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,340
how could you leave me alone?

53
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,980
If this

54
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,340
can save your life,

55
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm willing

56
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,820
to give your heart back.

57
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,180
But I have fallen in love with you.

58
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,060
From now on,

59
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,100
my heart will only beat for you.

60
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,340
Do you remember our show for Madam De?

61
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,180
As long as we love each other,

62
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,700
life can mean death,

63
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,260
and death can mean life.

64
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
I would rather be dead

65
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,860
if you left me.

66
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,700
But Jiang Bihan...

67
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,340
So what if she knows?

68
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,250
I wouldn't be afraid even if I had to

69
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,140
break my bones and ruin my reputation.

70
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,170
Besides, she has left Bai's Mansion.

71
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,460
She won't bother us.

72
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,020
Youyou.

73
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,820
Since the moment I stopped being Su Wen,

74
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,820
my life has been full of darkness.

75
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,460
But you...

76
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,700
lit up my world.

77
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,740
Would you give me all of you?

78
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,380
No matter what hardships we encounter,

79
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,900
I will protect you

80
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,820
and our family.

81
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,300
Trust me.

82
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,620
I am the famous Lord Qiansui.

83
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,860
Everything can be figured out.

84
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,020
My lord,

85
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,620
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,220
I didn't mean it.

87
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,490
That's it?

88
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,100
You have been

89
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,220
with those pretty boys these days.

90
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,540
I felt really sad.

91
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,180
Stop talking.

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Weren't you in the room with Jiang Bihan?

93
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,780
You came back to see me?

94
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,420
If it's not you,

95
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,020
I won't lose control

96
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,540
even if I lose my life.

97
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,900
Does it hurt?

98
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,740
It hurts here.

99
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,060
Lord.

100
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,260
Wait.

101
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,530
Come on. One, two, three.

102
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,290
Welcome home, wish you a long and happy marriage.

103

Welcome home, wish you a long and happy marriage.

104
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,220
Welcome home, wish you a long and happy marriage.

105
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,740
Stop!

106
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,260
Let's go, there are too many people.

107

[Happy Times]

108
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,380
I think I got it right this time.

109
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,820
Lord looks really happy.

110
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,220
Tiao, why are you crying?

111
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,220
Retreat.

112
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,740
Don't cry.

113
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
If Lord Bai sees this,

114
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,730
I will get punished again.

115
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,820
What's wrong?

116
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,420
Miss

117
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,380
bought...

118
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,410
She bought a yard in the northern city

119
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,090
and a house in the southern city,

120
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,420
and went back to the shop in the eastern city.

121
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,460
She...

122
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,700
What's your point?

123
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,580
It was really hard for her

124
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,970
to be this happy.

125
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,940
Yes.

126
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,580
I'm so happy.

127
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,460
Tiao.

128
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,500
Actually, this is a good thing.

129
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,580
You…

130
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,780
Wipe,

131
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,740
wipe your tears.

132
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,780
But don't blow your nose.

133
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,220
Alright.

134
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,180
I'll wash it for you, OK?

135
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,700
It's fine, don't worry.

136
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,500
I didn't

137
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,700
give you a perfect wedding before.

138
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,340
From now on,

139
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,660
I will pay you back with my life.

140
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,460
Well...

141
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,580
My lord, you can't go back on your words.

142
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,260
Are you still going to call me "my lord?"

143
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,420
My love.

144
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,100
My lord,

177
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm just on my period.

178
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,220
Come on. You will feel better after you drink it.

179
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,220
Hurry up. It's getting cold.

180
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,940
It's too bitter.

181
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,900
Then,

182
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,580
do you want me to feed you?

183
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,060
I envy you.

I also want to be a male.

186
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,860
OK.

187
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,460
I'll be your wife in the next life.

188
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,490
And I will

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,100
suffer this pain instead of you.

Miss Chen is usually very active.

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,500

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,900
Tiao,

194
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,620
do you know what's going on?

195
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,860
Me?

196
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,260
How would I know?

197
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,700
I've never been married.

198
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,580
Being married.

199
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,660
Not being married.

200
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,380
Got it.

201
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,820
Here.

202
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,540
Does it still hurt?

203
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,980
Much better.

204
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,930
But

205
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,820
if I eat something sweet,

206
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,780
I think I'll feel much better.

207
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,540
Gu Tianhe!

208
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,860
I got you, lord!

209
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,620
You...

210
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:20,980
What?

211
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,340
What did you get?

212
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,020
Cakes, snacks, melons, and preserved fruits.

213
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,220
Lord instructed us

214
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,300
on the food you like.

215
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,820
We have them all in the kitchen.

216
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,580
And

217
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,210
iced watermelon.

218
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,660
Who asked you to prepare cold food?

219
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,180
Lord, I

220
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,580
made a mistake again?

221
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,860
Go.

222
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,580
You are here eating dog food

223
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,940
and we're going to get punished.

224
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,100
Tiao.

225
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,940
What are you doing?

226
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
Get out of the way.

227
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,220
I asked the best physician in the southern city.

228
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,460
I also went to the eastern city to buy the best cinnamon from the west.

229
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:11,820
Yes.

230
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,740
And I...

231
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,700
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

232
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,900
Anyway, this sweet soup

233
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,260
will relieve her pain.

234
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,820
Get out of the way.

235
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,300
Wait.

236
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,100
Well, lord and madam

237
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,220
are busy at the moment.

238
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,940
What are they doing at this critical moment?

239
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,300
Anyway,

240
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,140
if you don't want

241
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,420
to go to the old place to be punished,

242
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,860
don't go in.

243
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:52,940
Well,

244
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,740
you're going to get punished again?

245
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,820
Can I go and have a look?

246
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,820
General Gu,

247
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,460
are you ready?

248
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,700
Come on.

249
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,720
[Old Place]

250
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,700
Lord, I won't do it again!

251
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,740
What's wrong?

252
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,740
What's so funny?

253
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,180
Thank you, Your Royal Highness,

254
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,460
for bringing the Fortune Shop so many instruments.

255
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,940
I've seen the Fortune Shop

256
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,300
to get on the right track.

257
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,380
So this is my gift.

258
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,020
Youyou,

259
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,900
I have another gift for you.

260
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,820
What's this?

261
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,810
This is my improved friendship cake.

262
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,780
Give it a try.

263
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,460
Your Royal Highness...

264
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,380
From now on,

265
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,780
we are just good friends who make pastries together.

266
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,220
Not bad.

267
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,540
My lord!

268
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,380
What a pity.

269
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,460
You can't eat this anymore.

270
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,660
Does that mean that you're leaving?

271
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,810
I'll travel to all cities and learn to make new pastries.

272
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,860
It's what I've always wished for.

273
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,740
I think

274
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,820
it's time to fulfill my dream.

275
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,340
There are seven cities

276
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,700
near Fuxian City.

277
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,020
They have all types of delicacies and customs.

278
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,900
I believe Your Royal Highness

279
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,010
will get a lot from these trips.

280
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,940
See you.

281
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,420
Although I sent Youyou by your side this time,

282
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,220
don't get too excited.

283
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,220
If you dare to do anything bad to her,

284
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,820
even if I'm far away,

285
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,340
I will take her away from you immediately.

286
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,290
Don't worry.

287
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,020
That won't be necessary.

288
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,650
[Fortune Shop]

289
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,660
I'm leaving.

290
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,260
When I come back from my study,

291
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,740
I'll treat you to a good meal.

292
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,770
[Fortune Shop]

293
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,300
Goodbye.

294

[Fortune Shop]

295
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,700
My lord!

296
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,660
Youyou, no!

297
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,460
What's wrong?

298
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,900
My lord.

299
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,140
Did you have a nightmare?

300
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:20,980
Youyou.

301
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,460
That day by the river,

302
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,860
you told me you would never leave me again.

303
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,420
And you wouldn't leave no matter what.

304
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,380
Is that right?

305
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,060
Yes.

306
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,820
I'm stuck with you.

307
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,300
You won't get rid of me

308
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,820
for the rest of our lives.

309
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,980
My lord.

310
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
In the past,

311
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,500
you've always protected me.

312
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,060
Then let me protect you

313
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,300
in your dreams.

314
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,660
If you encounter something bad

315
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,300
in your dreams,

316
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,260
just think

317
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,940
that I am still by your side

318
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,060
and everything will be fine.

319
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,940
By the way,

320
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,180
the 15th is coming up soon.

321
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,980
It so happens that you are on vacation.

322
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,260
How about

323
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,380
we go to the temple to pray?

324
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,820
OK.

325
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,200
[Bai's Mansion]

326
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,740
Oh, Tiao.

327
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,900
Have you brought the candles?

328
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,500
Lord.

329
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,020
Yes.

330
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,580
You have never believed

331
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,100
in God or Buddha.

332
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,900
I believe in her.

333
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,380
By the way, Madam.

334
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,290
Why are you suddenly going to the Tanmen temple?

335
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,700
Lord has been working so hard recently.

336
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,220
I want to go

337
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,940
so that he can take a break.

338
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,180
Give me the bag.

[Bai's Mansion]

340
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,660
I haven't left the city for a long time.

341
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,780
This landscape is so beautiful.

342
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,060
We depart at 7:00 AM.

343
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,090
We have lunch at 11:00 AM.

344
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,460
We worship Buddha at 3:00 PM.

345
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
We go to sleep at 9:00 PM.

346
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,740
Why can't we sleep together?

347
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,180
My lord,

348
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,740
it's a Buddhist temple.

349
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,900
It's inappropriate for men and women to share a room.

350
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,820
But the castellan made us husband and wife.

351
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,300
It's still inappropriate.

352
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,060
We're going to pray for blessings.

353
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,380
Only when we put our whole hearts into it

354
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,660
will our wishes come true.

355
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,260
But

356
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,740
what if I had a nightmare tonight?

some soothing incenses for you.

359
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,460

360
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,300
You will sleep great.

361

My lord,

362
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,140
behave yourself.

363
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,740
No.

364
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,300
Tiao.

365
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,700

the supervisor in the temple

has arranged our rooms.

371
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,620
You should go to bed early tonight

372
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,580
and have a good sleep.

373
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,060
OK.

374
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,940
So cute.

376
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,860
What's wrong?

377

378
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,060
is there anything wrong?

379
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,250
Something feels strange.

380
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,940
I feel like I've been here before.

381
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,780
And that man,

382
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,660
I think I've seen him before.

383
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,180
I'll go check it out.

384
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,140
Don't act rashly.

385
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,660
Be careful tonight.

386
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,340
Don't worry.

387
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,220
I will do my best to protect you

388
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,860
and your wife.

389
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,620
Madam, don't worry.

390
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,460
I will protect you

391
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,980
against all dangers.

392
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,700
Tiao.

393
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,580
Is it because you've been spending too much time with General Gu lately?

394
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,500
You talk like him.

395
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,900
No way.

396
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,300
Let's go inside.

397
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Madam, wait for me.

398
00:25:49,270 --> 00:26:02,670
[Tanmen temple]

399
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,780
Buddha,

400
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,690
I, Chen Youyou,

401
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,820
live in Bai's Mansion in the south of Fuxian City.

402
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
I came to pay my respects.

403
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,900
I sincerely pray

404
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,940
so that Buddha can bless my husband,

405
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,100
Bai Li.

406
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,460
He helps the castellan uphold justice.

407
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,500
He does good deeds and helps people.

408
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,930
He's a good person.

409
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,660
He's also really nice to me.

410
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,260
For a long time,

411
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,340
he endured a hard life

412
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,780
full of secrets.

413
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,100
Finally he can settle down,

414
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,820
but is still suffering from nightmares.

415
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,420
Buddha,

416
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,340
please protect him

417
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,850
from nightmares.

418
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,900
Or...

419
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,540
Let me share his pain.

420
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,340
I'm willing to share his burden.

421
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,940
I just hope

422
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,700
he lives a happy and peaceful life.

423
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,900
My lord.

424
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,130
How come you're here?

425
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,500
I came to pay my respects.

426
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,860
I'll join you.

427
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,700
Buddha,

428
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,540
she said she would share the burden with me,

429
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,500
please don't take it seriously.

430
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,940
As she said,

431
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,570
for so many years,

432
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,100
I've been living in the darkness.

433
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,940
She is the only light in my life.

434
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,580
I just hope

435
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,660
she'll be by my side

436
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,010
and enjoy a healthy and happy life.

437
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,500
If there is any pain or suffering,

438
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,780
I will bear it all.

439
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,820
My lord,

440
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,260
what wishes are you making?

441
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,050
It takes so long.

442
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,060
Behave yourself

443
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,380
in front of Buddha.

444
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,180
This...

445
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,420
Wait for me here. I'll be back soon.

446
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,420
My lord.

447
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,180
My lord!

448
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,140
Youyou!

449
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,900
Who are you?

450
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,740
You're in a high position, but you're not doing your job.

451
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,740
You're disloyal.

452
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,340
You indulge in childish love and forgot your roots.

453
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,460
This is impious.

454
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,020
You broke your promise and forgot your original intention.

455
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,220
This is unrighteous.

456
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,260
Do you acknowledge your mistake?

457
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,140
Master.
