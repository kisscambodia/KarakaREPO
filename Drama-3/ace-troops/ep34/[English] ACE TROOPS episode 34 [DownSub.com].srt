Before coming,

114
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,440
there was a question

115
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
confusing me specially.

116
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,920
When I knew that Professor Emir

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
was a young ethnic Chinese woman,

118
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
I've been hesitating about

119
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,600
shall I salute her?

120
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,240
After all, this is

121
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,760
my greatest sincerity.

122
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
But I thought she was a foreigner

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,960
and afraid that she would be overwhelmed.

124
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,520
But now I think

125
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,200
you deserve it.

126
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
This is not only because of my own debt,

127
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,360
it also has nothing to do with my plea today.

128
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,720
It's because of you, Hu Yang,

129
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,680
as a Chinese descendant,

130
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,400
who struggles and persists overseas who

131
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,320
deserves it.

132
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,400
How can you...

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,120
You know I can't stand this the most.

134
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,320

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,760

137
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,520
why did you refuse to operate for Gao Liang.

138
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,160
I have requirements for my career,

139
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,520
just like you.

140
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,520
I just said that,

141
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,520
in the past over ten years

142
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,440
I haven't

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,720

144
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,520
And Gao Liang's situation today

145
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,000
is like a gamble for me.

146
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,320
I am a scientist

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,760
and I don't gamble.

148
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,960
In fact, there are times when I'm not pure.

149
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,360
When I saw you just now

150
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
I couldn't help asking myself

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,640
if the wounded person is you,

152
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,280
would I do it?

153
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,880
What's the answer?

154
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,200
I will not hesitate.

155
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,920
But that's it.

156
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,800
It shows that you are sincere to catch up here.

160
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,080
Come on, comrade officer.

Sure. Wait a minute.

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,080
I've met Gu Yiye.

166

167
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,080

how much do you value your career.

169
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,840
As far as I know,

170
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,720
you are the expert in the field of information.

171
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,160
You should understand that this reputation

contains our enthusiasm and ratification

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680

174
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,600
Of course,

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
it also contains values.

176
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
You are right.

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,560
I don't gamble.

182
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
You have five minutes left.

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,480
We are soldiers.

184
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,640
Sometimes in front of reason,

185
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,680
another occupation is very similar to us.

186
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,320
It's Doctor.

187
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,160
It makes sense.

188
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
But you still haven't convinced me.

189
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,560
Just a hint.

190
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,960
A female scientist

191
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,880
can convince better

192
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,280

Professor Hu Yang,

392
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,880
you two are bounded by fate.

put a bomb in my body.

402
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,760
Yes. She did.

403
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,240
And she said

404
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,960
she would bomb you

405
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,960

406
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,400
All right.

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
I have nothing to fear.

408
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,480

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,320
Are you really not afraid?

I will worship you, the best doctor.

428
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,800
Thanks. Don't do that.

429
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,400
I just want to see

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,080
is it about Gao Liang's illness?

438
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,080
I want to talk to the patient's family alone.

439
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,680
She is not yet.

440
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,400
Yiye,

441
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,520
you have no right to know.

442
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,760

Just say it.

446
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,520
One of you pretend to attack, another strongly attack to

447
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,600
persuade me jointly.

448
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,680
Is it premeditated?

449
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,000
No.

450
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,840
What we have is just sincerity,

451
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,760
Simple and direct.

452
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,720
Next, I'm telling the truth.

453
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,760
Please be prepared.

454
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,240
Especially you.

455
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
There was nothing wrong during the operation,

456
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,320
but it doesn't mean everything is fine.

457
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,880
For such patients,

458
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,760
the most difficult stage has just begun.

459
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,320
The most difficult stage?

460
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,600
Rehabilitation training.

461
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,480
His nervous system is damaged.

462
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,680
The degree of damage needs time to be verified.

463
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,440
It doesn't matter.

464
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,640
As long as he is recovering,

465
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,680
just getting better is good.

466
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,120
Legally,

467
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
are you his wife?

468
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,480
She always wanted to be his wife.

469
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
Do you must marry him?

470
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,880
Yes.

471
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,920
If he can never stand,

472
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,480
will you insist on it?

473
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,120
What do you mean?

474
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,800
Two weeks have passed.

475
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,280
The motor nerves of his lower limbs

476
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,000
has rarely no reaction on

477
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,120
external stimulation.

478
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,400
It can be concluded that

479
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,200
the injury this time has caused a

480
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,680
damage to his spinal nerve

481
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,800
which is beyond our judgment.

482
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
But doesn't rehabilitation treatment

483
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,560
just start?

484
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,440
Is it too early to make a final decision?

485
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,040
Rehabilitation treatment will have a certain effect.

486
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,800
But for organic damage,

487
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,640
the effect is extremely limited after all.

488
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,640
As long as it works,

489
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
even a little,

490
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,880
I will try.

491
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,080
But if efforts

492
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,400
are in vain after many years?

493
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,920
for example, ten years,

494
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,120
twenty years

495
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,520
or a lifetime.

496
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,280
So I advise you

497
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,480
onsider it carefully.

498
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,680
Nanzheng,

499
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,960
don't listen to her.

500
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
She is scaring you.

501
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,800
In the past, Gao Liang

502
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,480
teased her.

503
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,000
She is taking a revenge.

504
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,480
Don't take it to heart.

505
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,480
I forgive you, Gu Yiye.

506
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,560
Such a lie

507
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,880
just touched me a little.

508
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,920
It is very kind.

509
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,400
Hu Yang,

510
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,800
do you have to do this?

511
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
I am a doctor.

512
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,480
I am responsible for everything I say.

513
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,600
I like the sentence you gave me.

514
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,400
Don't pursue victory.

515
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,600
Just pursue the courage to move forward.

516
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
if you really believe this sentence,

517
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,080
I shouldn't worry about you.

518
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,560
But as a woman,

519
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,520
I still can't help reminding you that

520
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,920
looking for hope in despair

521
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,280
can be very hard

522
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,200
and very difficult.

523
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,840
Thank you.

524
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,600
I will insist.

525
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,280
Cheer up as soon as possible.

526
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,080
As a doctor, I treat the body rather than the heart.

527
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
I can only do this for you.

528
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,840
Go and see uncle Gu.

529
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,720
I'll see her off.

530
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,360
You're back.

531
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,000
Come on.

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,920
Eat some noodles with soup.

533
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,560
It's hot, be careful.

534
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,560
I have told the deputy battalion commander.

535
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,200
The table will be sent later.

536
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,320
All that should be boxed are boxed.

537
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,680
Xiu,

538
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,160
where are my uniforms?

539
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,440
They have been boxed.

540
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,520
Others

541
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,920
have been managed

542
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,040
or been

543
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,880
given away.

544
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,080
Where are my uniforms?

545
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,080
Here.

546
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,440
These are more than 100 pairs of insoles which made

547
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,200
by Jiagui's mom,

548
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,360
especially for our team.

549
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,760
Our mom

550
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,280
is not in good condition

551
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,320
so she can't see you in person.

552
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,160
She asked me to bring you two pairs.

553
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,040
Don't you know

554
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,280
soldiers in the team

555
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,480
are scrambling for these insoles,do you?

556
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,800
I told them

557
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,280
this

558
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,880
is made by hero's mom.

559
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,360
If you want it,

560
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,480
exchange with your grades.

561
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,400
Well,

562
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,400
these guys are very competitive.

563
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,560
Their performances are better and better.

564
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,760
They also got the

565
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,920
red flag of training pacesetter

566
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,200
again.

567
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,680
That's great.

568
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,560
That's great.

569
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,240
Thank our mom for me.

570
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,840
But please take these back.

571
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,040
Deliver them to other comrades.

572
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,720
I can't use them here either.

573
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,720
Niu,

574
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,440
I don't know how long I've been lying down.

575
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,720
I almost forget

576
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,200
what is our army like.

577
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
There isn't a wake-up song

578
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,240
nor queue song.

579
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,880
Singing is not required before meal.

580
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,480
I just need to lie down.

581
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,600
Nobody governs me.

582
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,920
I used to run a 10 kilometers cross-country

583
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,840
without breathing heavily.

584
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,800
Now,

585
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,480
I can hardly hear myself panting.

586
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
But I have something new

587
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,640
to tell you.

588
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,800
Do you know

589
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,960
Glycerine Enema?

590
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,720
After using it,

591
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,640
you can't control yourself.

592
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,080
Look at me now,

593
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,840
look,

594
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,840
my pants,

595
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,120
look here,

596
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,200
a pile of

597
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
adult diapers.

598
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,280
That's not enough.

599
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,840
A layer of diaper must be put under it.

600
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,800
Lower,

601
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,440
a layer of plastic cloth must be padded.

602
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,880
Because I'm afraid of wetting the bed.

603
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,640
When you're here,

604
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,200
I can't even pour your water.

605
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,240
Do you know that time

606
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,480
Nanzheng came,

607
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,760
changed my clothes

608
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,200
and wiped my body..

609
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,040
Do you know how I felt in my heart?

610
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,840
Niu,

611
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
I am a soldier.

612
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,600
I have been a soldier all my life.

613
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,720
Now I can only lie on this damn bed.

614
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,640
I can do nothing.

615
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,080
How long do I need to lie down?

616
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,160
When,

617
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,320
Until when?

618
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,640
A lifetime?

619
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,880
Can I ask her to serve me all my life?

620
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,440
Niu,

621
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,280
I am telling you,

622
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,440
if you are free

623
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,120
later,

624
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,360
go back and pay attention to training,

625
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,640
especially new soldiers.

626
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,600
Don't come to see me

627
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,320
to waste time.

628
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,000
Gao,

629
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,200
I know

630
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,320
you hate to part with,

631
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,880
hate to part with military uniform.

632
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,560
Niu,

633
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,200
I'm fine.

634
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
I just feel wronged staying here.

635
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,360
I want to go back to the army.

636
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,680
I don't want to stay in this bed.

637
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,600
I know.

638
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,440
I want to hear those queue slogans.

639
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,240
OK.

640
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,560
Fine.

641
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,560
I also heard that

642
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,120
mule Gu

643
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,480
was cashiered.

644
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,320
Come on,

645
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:34,880
open your mouth.

646
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,000
You can't be dehydrated, come on.

647
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,400
Bro.

648
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,000
I am broken.

649
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,440
This is not what I want.

650
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
I can't walk,

651
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,960
I can't run.

652
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,480
I can't feel about my legs.

653
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,320
I have lost the most basic ability to live.

654
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,360
I feel death is better than living like this.

655
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,040
What makes me worse

656
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,360
is witnessing my favorite girl

657
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,440
giving up her life

658
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,150
and living with me in such a terrible condition.

659
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,460
[Ward]

660
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,480
Go out.

661
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What's wrong?

662
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,480
He should do hyperbaric oxygen

663
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,000
but he just doesn't cooperate.

664
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Do for what?

665
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,520
It's been more than a month.

666
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,150
I still don't know where my legs are.

667
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,630
Gao Liang,

668
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,320
hyperbaric oxygen is helpful

669
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,960
for your nervous system's recovery.

670
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,440
Help? What help?

671
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,880
I have done so many times.

672
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,880
It's like punishment every time.

673
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,150
disability is still a disability.

674
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,960
I won't do it.

675
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,630
Go out.

676
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,710
Go out!

677
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,800
Comrade,

678
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,560
so sorry.

679
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,160
He is in a bad mood today.

680
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,240
Or I will call you later.

681
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,080
Thanks.

682
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,760
Gao Liang, why don't you cooperate with the treatment?

683
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,640
I am telling you,

684
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,760
I've had enough this month.

685
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,360
I have to say it today.

686
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,480
Gu Yiye,

687
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,390
get her out of here.

688
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,000
I don't want to see your face

689
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,080
in front of me every day.

690
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,960
It makes me annoyed

691
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,480
and angry.

692
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,320
I can't breathe.

693
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,720
You make me unable to concentrate on recovery,

694
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,600
do you understand?

695
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,720
Why are you looking at me?

696
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,280
Why are you looking at me?

697
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,480
Don't you think you're redundant here?

698
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,680
Don't you think you are embarrassing me?

699
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,840
Go out!

700
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,520
Go out!

701
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,280
Go!

702
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,760
Gao Liang,

703
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,240
are you crazy?

704
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,800
I'll be crazy if she is still here.

705
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,640
Get her out.

706
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,760
Nanzheng.

707
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,400
Gao Liang,

708
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,080
why do you speak like that to Nanzheng?

709
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,680
What?

710
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,840
Do you think you are paralyzed

711
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,960
so the whole world owes you, don't you?

712
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
Do you know that

713
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,320
in order to make you wake up, Nanzheng sit

714
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,360
with you and talked to you everyday,

715
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,240
and ran out to find a place to cry

716
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,120
every night?

717
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,280
Then she cleaned herself,

718
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,800
came back and cared you with smile.

719
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,200
For you,

720
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,160
she begged everywhere

721
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,040
to find an

722
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,440
expert who can do surgery for you.

723
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,000
For you,

724
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,080
she quarreled with others

725
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,120
to acquire marriage procedures.

726
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,400
For you,

727
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,240
she gave up

728
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,840
the opportunity to get a PhD.

729
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,720
She gave up herself

730
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,880
just for...

731
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
For one day,

732
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,960
you can stand up.

733
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,720
That's why

734
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,040
I hate myself.

735
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
She shouldn't bear these.

736
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,960
Right?

737
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,520
Why should she bear these?

738
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,760
The more she does,

739
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,440
the more I hate myself.

740
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
It is all because of my useless legs,

741
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,160
useless legs.

742
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,520
She did everything because she loves you.

743
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,520
I don't need it.

744
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Both of you know I can't stand up.

745
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,120
You guys lied to me together.

746
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,120
Gao Liang, I apologize to you.

747
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,000
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

748
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,000
From today,

749
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,920
I promise you

750
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,760
I won't hide anything again.

751
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,560
I will tell you the truth about your illness.

752
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,200
Let's face this difficulty together.

753
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,840
I believe you can do it.

754
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
I don't believe.

755
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,680
I know what you just said

756
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,080
is to drive me away.

757
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,120
You don't want to drag me down.

758
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,040
You want me to give up.

759
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,960
You know it will annoy me.

760
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,440
You want me to hate you.

761
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,560
But I am telling you, Gao Liang.

762
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,760
Whatever you say,

763
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,000
I won't give up.

764
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,520
You are not allowed to give up either.

765
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,080
You just ran into this difficulty suddenly

766
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,080
and were panic.

767
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,800
You don't know what to do.

768
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,040
Nanzheng,

769
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,280
I am telling you,

770
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,240
before I can stand up,

771
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,840
I won't marry you.

772
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,320
That means

773
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,840
you should leave me now.

774
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,920
You should find someone

775
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,120
who loves you,

776
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
find someone you want to marry.

777
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,640
You should enjoy a happy life.

778
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,560
Don't waste time here.

779
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,640
OK?

780
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,040
I bless you.

781
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,480
I can promise you.

782
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,800
But I have conditions.

783
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,560
Say it.

784
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,010
One year later,

785
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,080
I will leave.

786
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,800
But now,

787
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,760
let's start.

788
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,520
If you don't speak, I'll take it as a promise.

789
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,280
OK.

790
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,960
Let's get back to the main topic.

791
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,840
I have checked the data.

792
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,920
There are many cases like you.

793
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
The proportion of complete recovery is less than 3%.

794
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,240
But

795
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,400
there is always a possibility of 3%.

796
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,080
In the proportion of 3%,

797
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,640
90% of them

798
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,360
are all athletes.

799
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,080
That means

800
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,920
your previous training as special forces

801
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,280
is helpful for your recovery.

802
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,160
Even if there is only a little possibility,

803
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,800
we work together.

804
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,760
Or

805
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,120
change to this one?

806
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,760
You will go away on vacation

807
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,640
so wearing cloth shoes will be more comfortable.

808
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,800
Forget it.

809
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,120
Just wear this.

810
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,080
It's up to you.

811
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,640
Wear this.

812
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,400
It's comfortable.

813
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,600
Fei,

814
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,880
let me ask you,

815
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,200
do you want to be a soldier?

816
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,160
I ask you one more time.

817
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Do you want to be a soldier,

818
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,200
like your father,

819
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,440
like me?

820
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:44,060
[ZhangMu Station]

821
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,680
Go back.

822
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,360
Go back.

823
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,080
Cadres' children are beating people.

824
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,280
What kind of man are you to hit one person with three people?

825
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,080
Do you have the ability to fight one-on-one?

826
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,160
OK. One-on-one.

827
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,600
Come on.

828
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,040
Let me show you

829
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,440
what is relentlessly beating the dog in the water?
