Neptune

00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,199
not sleeping so late

3
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,400
I have been disturbed in Quanxian during this time.

4
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,639
thanks to you too

5
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,239
My body can gradually recover

6
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,279
I have something to ask you

7
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,599
You said

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,119
i know i forgot something

9
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,679
But these things should be about you

10
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,479
Sister Hongyuan and His Royal Highness the Prince

11
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,679
They are all speechless

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,240
So I had to ask you

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
what happened to me

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,759
and

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,839
Is this bead related to you?

16
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,839
the things you can't remember

17
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,600
do you still care

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
I've been trying to piece together

19
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,880
memory left in mind

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,399
But I can't remember

21
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,720
even if i tell you

22
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,720
That's just a story

23
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,320
Why are you obsessed with this?

24
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,199
Maybe these memories are important to me

25
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,800
doesn't it matter

26
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,759
As long as you live it's more important than anything

27
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,520
I plan to leave the Quanxian camp tomorrow.

28
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,839
Before my brother came back from Taoyuan County

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,639
I will take care of Na Sheng in the hut

30
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,320
if you have something to do

31
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,919
If there is anything you can come to me anytime

32
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,399
I can no longer protect you

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
I don't want you and me in the next danger

34
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,360
It's best if you live

35
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:43,039
It doesn't matter if you can't remember me

36
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,800
as long as you live

37
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,800
more important than anything

38
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,080
Why does he look so sad

39
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,960
how do i remember this

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,399
Neptune

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,760
Si Shi

42
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,200
Bai Ying, she forgot her past with me

43
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,239
Is this forcibly opening the five rhymes and six senses?

44
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,559
the result in exchange?

45
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,079
Bai Ying and I are destined to never be together

46
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,920
She unlocked the seal of the Dragon God for me

47
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,799
But I can't carry the power of the Dragon God

48
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,440
I saved her life

49
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,600
She forgot her relationship with me

50
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
you have tried your best

51
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:10,799
no self-blame

Si Shi

53
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,760
I decided to practice cracking again to fight the prey

54
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,079
absolutely not

55
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,959
The art of cracking is even worse than the art of mirror

56
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,119
I know

57
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,799
But apart from the fissure

58
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,720
there is no other way

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
can defeat the prey

60
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,799
if there is another way

61
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
Obtain the power of the Dragon God

62
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
I won't take the risk of practicing fission

63
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Master this thing

64
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,519
I don't want people to know

65
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,600
I sometimes think

66
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,799
Does the Dragon God think

67
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,399
I'm not a real sea king

68
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,279
Dragon God seems to have another meaning

69
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,200
Yes, some time ago

70
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,679
has a mysterious power

71
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,359
call me with ice crystals

72
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,279
call you

73
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,799
It seems to be the blood of the emperor

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,359
Bloodline of the Emperor

75
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,119
Since the Dragon God's seal was lifted

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,679
Everything just got more chaotic

77
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,920
maybe clean up the mess

00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,640
How to get the power of the dragon god

80
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,679
correct

81
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,160
I saw someone enter the ice room today

82
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,799
I thought it was you

83
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,320
But when I got in, there was no one there

84
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,399
Who is it

85
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,239
Nasheng

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,760
Yanxi

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,200
Yanxi, you are awake

88
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,320
Great, great, you're finally awake

89
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,760
you're scaring me

90
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,440
I thought I'd never see you again

91
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,839
Nasheng

92
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,440
you overwhelmed me

93
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,959
I'm sorry I'm so excited

94
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,200
I didn't hurt you

95
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,000
Did you suffer a lot in prison?

96
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,239
It's my fault

97
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,519
is my problem

98
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,559
I shouldn't have left you back alone

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,519
made you suffer so much

100
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,040
good thing you're all right

101
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,399
If the spirit of tranquility is in the sky

102
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,359
see you awake

103
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,959
She should be happy

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,399
Yanxi, don't get up

105
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,799
Zhixiu said

106
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,279
Your body just needs rest

107
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,200
you drink first

108
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,119
I'll come by myself

109
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,679
You just woke up and your body is still weak

110
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,480
I'll come

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,920
what to see

112
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,480
nothing

113
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,480
You just woke up and you are still very weak

114
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm right here with you

115
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
to wipe

116
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,320
Little Lord

117
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,479
You've been getting worse over the past two days

118
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,080
Do you want me to check it for you

119
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,599
i'm fine

120
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,200
I still don't understand

121
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,080
Now that the young master has unlocked the seal of the Dragon God

122
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,559
Obtained the power of the Dragon God

123
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,599
Why is it still being attacked?

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
I'm just a little sick

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,760
Just take a few days off

126
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,400
Little Lord

127
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,520
no matter what happens

128
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,960
You should take your body first

129
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,119
If you have something that needs to be repaired

130
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,320
Anything can be repaired

131
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,239
Thank you Zhixiu

133
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,520
What is Sheng looking at?

134
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,640
why haven't you left

135
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,599
I will go back to the wooden house with my sister Bai Ying in a while.

136
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,320
do you want to send us

137
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,320
someone should escort you

138
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Be careful on the road

139
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
Si Shi

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,440
What's the matter with you, why are you so weak

141
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,280
I've been feeling worse and worse these days

142
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,719
It's because of the cracking technique

143
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,520
Neptune

144
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,919
Sir, I know what you're going to say

145
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,119
there is something i want to ask you

146
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,960
You guarded the spring for thousands of years

147
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,880
I believe you will never lie to me

148
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,520
I would like to know

149
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,760
Am I the King of the Sea?

150
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,239
of course you are

151
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,799
You have the mark of the Dragon God behind you

152
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,799
You can also call me through ice crystals

153
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,400
you are the emperor

154
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,640
Maybe the dragon god is not looking for me at all

155
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,640
seven thousand years ago

156
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,080
I keep the blood of the sea emperor in the spirit bead

157
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,400
Yuji swallowed and gave birth to you

158
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,760
You have the blood of the Emperor of the Sea running through you.

159
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,080
born at the same time

160
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,799
And my brother Suno

161
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,640
Suno is dead

162
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,159
what if he hadn't died

163
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,280
Maybe he can carry the power of the Dragon God

164
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,919
Maybe he's the real King of the Sea

165
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:28,159
The Dragon God may be testing you

166
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,919
You shouldn't have doubts about your identity

167
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,000
Si Shi

168
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,520
I doubt my own ability

169
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,119
if i can't

170
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,479
Bring spring back to Biluohai first

171
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,239
How should I face you

172
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,880
The poison has already entered Su G's body

173
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,320
Now is the time to kill him

174
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,679
Little Lord

175
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,320
Elder Quan

176
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,039
what's wrong with me

177
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:40,239
It's been some time since the young master returned from the trapped Longyuan.

178
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,440
Zuo Quanshi was successfully rescued

179
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,760
Bai Wang has also left after recovering from his injury

180
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,159
Dare to ask the young master

181
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,679
The incident of attacking Cangliu and returning to Biluohai

182
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,840
have plans

183
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,479
Quan Xian's generals and soldiers are all looking forward to it

184
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,039
Little Lord

185
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,200
The young master may be in trouble

186
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,640
In addition to the five divisions of Cangliu

187
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,719
the real master

188
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,719
is the prey on the mirror tower

189
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,960
The young master has obtained the power of the dragon god

190
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,679
Can't beat the prey?

191
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,400
Attackers should not act rashly

192
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:21,719
I don't want to see Quan Xian

193
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,559
more casualties

194
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,640
is the lord

195
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,479
However, Quan Xian's generals and soldiers are not afraid of sacrifice

196
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,679
After all, we waited seven thousand years

197
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,960
to return to the blue sea

198
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,919
I finally see hope

199
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,919
Sir, are you going out?

200
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,039
Jixiu has something to do with me

201
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,799
How are you feeling these two days?

202
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,599
already much better

203
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,599
I don't need to worry about repairs.

204
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,880
I'll check again for you

205
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,679
no need

206
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,640
I feel like my body is about to recover.

207
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,559
Repair, don't worry

208
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,159
something else

209
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,080
that's all right

210
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,200
By the way, the white king left in a hurry that day.

211
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,320
I didn't get the medicine that I made for her

212
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,119
give her

213
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Just finished today

214
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
I'm going to send her to the cabin

215
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:00,880
are you

216
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,880
Is there anything you need me to greet

217
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,239
Just give me the medicine

218
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,320
how did you come

219
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,880
I'll bring you medicine

220
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,919
Are you used to living here?

221
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,280
Habit

222
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,559
correct

223
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,200
Did you give me this light shield?

224
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,559
That's right

225
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,919
really you

226
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,440
What happens when you knock three times?

227
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,479
i will appear

228
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,159
That's why you came here

229
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,320
this medicine for you

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,280
Did you give me medicine before?

231
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,880
Can't remember the past

232
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,159
don't force it

233
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,679
I go first

234
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,280
A Ying

235
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:07,839
Your Highness

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,680
what are you waiting for

237
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,599
no

238
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,839
I am coming

239
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,000
are you disappointed

240
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:16,920
Your Highness

241
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,680
What about Sheng who is joking with you?

242
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,040
She hasn't troubled you lately, has she?

243
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,800
She said she went to catch the rabbit

244
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,199
Should be back soon

245
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,560
This is the light-shielding pearl that Su G gave me

246
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,079
you know

247
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,680
About Sunshine Pearl About Him

248
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:49,920
you know

249
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
what he told you

250
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
he told me

251
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,439
If you can't remember, don't force it

252
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,640
I agreed

253
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,400
It wasn't your intention, was it?

254
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,959
Otherwise, how could you be so sad?

255
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,479
I thought I had a chance

256
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,319
Maybe you're lying to yourself

257
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,880
because

258
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
Even if you don't remember the past

259
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:33,640
you won't change me

260
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,439
Sorry

261
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,439
i don't want to hurt you

262
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,599
No need to say sorry

263
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,680
you didn't hurt me

264
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,079
you never owe me

265
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,439
Aying if you ask me

266
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,560
I don't want you to remember your past with him

267
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,800
i will answer i hope

268
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,920
Because only remember those

269
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
You will be the complete Aying

270
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,959
Aying, you forgot

271
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,959
you love su g

272
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:42,839
open the door

273
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,439
Feather magic

274
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,359
Major General

275
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,839
Why are you acting like a lost dog now?

276
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,439
dying

277
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,280
Do you still like my cell?

278
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:22,800
And something fresher and more exciting

279
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,000
Would you like to try it?

280
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,160
not talking

281
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,479
I have a way to make you speak

282
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,520
see how long you can endure

283
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,800
i can be here now

284
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,520
It's because the trapped Longyuan mission failed.

285
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,959
I deserve to be punished as a soldier

286
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,079
not because i'm afraid of you

287
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,079
As expected of General Yu Huan

288
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,680
The bones are hard enough

289
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,280
what are you laughing at

290
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,479
a mere blacksmith

291
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,760
designed some unheard of cruelty

292
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,160
I want to do whatever I want in this prison

293
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,040
It's just a dog raised by Shi Peng.

294
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,319
I am a dog raised by Master Shi Peng

295
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,839
You, General Feather

296
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,880
Not even a dog

297
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,359
You are not even qualified to be a dog for Master Shi Peng

298
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,599
you say your holy sister

299
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,959
If I see you being tortured

300
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,199
what will happen

301
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,760
to save you

302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,680
Is she willing to do anything?

303
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
scent on her

304
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,640
it's me

305
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,959
me me me

306
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,239
it's me

307
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,439
How did you come

308
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,439
I should ask you this

309
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm here to save you

310
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,599
how did you come out

311
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,560
help me

312
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,199
are you going to jail

313
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm not that stupid

314
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,800
i have token

315
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,719
you can do this kind of thing

316
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,719
It didn't help anyway.

317
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,280
how did you get out

318
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,719
Fei Lian, help me with something

319
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,839
I'm here to help you

320
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,319
Help me find a place to stay temporarily

321
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:14,880
good

322
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,479
But you have to come with me

323
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:17,920
thanks

324
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,439
Elder Quan

325
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,680
Zuo Quan, why did you come out?

326
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,239
body recovered

327
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,599
Why is the elder so sad?

328
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,000
What happened

329
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,959
left power

330
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,880
I've been thinking about some things for a long time

331
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,199
don't feel right

332
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,560
What's wrong

333
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I suspect

334
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,520
Young Master is hiding something from us

335
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,160
What's up

336
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I suspect that the young master has not obtained the power of the dragon god

337
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,119
Reasonably, the young master unlocks the seal of the Dragon God

338
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,640
Gain the power of the Dragon God

339
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,439
Take us to attack Cangliu as soon as possible

340
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,040
Take us back to Biluohai

341
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:44,560
But the young master not only did not act

342
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,040
His body is getting weaker and weaker.

343
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,839
If the young master really did not get the power of the dragon god

344
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,479
He shouldn't hide anything from us

345
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,920
But now he's silent

346
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,880
does he have any secrets

347
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,719
This is about the safety of Quan Xian

348
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,520
If the young master really did not get the power of the dragon god

349
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,880
does it mean

350
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,680
He's not the king

351
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,479
He's not a sea king

352
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,959
then we

353
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,479
No, I'm going to ask him

354
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,199
elders wait

355
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,319
split

356
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,119
I didn't expect it

357
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,839
You thought you could beat me with a split

358
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
poison in your body

359
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,560
It's designed to deal with cracking.

360
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,880
The more you use the more pain

361
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,079
who are you

362
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,560
lock him up

363
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,760
lock him in

364
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,119
you go in

365
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,920
lock the door

366
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,680
i can't cry

367
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,959
Suno, I'm here to save you

368
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,280
i can't cry

369
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,959
You said we can't cry easily

370
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,359
I did it

371
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,680
someone bullied you

372
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,719
I must be stronger than others

373
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,880
don't let anyone bully me

374
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
i will do it

375
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,119
who do you say i am

376
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,359
you are suno

377
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,640
I didn't expect you to remember the name Su Nuo

378
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,160
you are not dead

379
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,680
why am i not dead

380
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,839
why kill you

381
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,359
Although we were born of a mother

382
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:13,119
But it was completely different

383
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,599
if it is possible

384
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,680
I'd rather not Suno

385
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,479
As your Su G's younger brother

386
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,079
Born with only pain

387
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,560
In order to secure the throne of the Sea King

388
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,760
practice mirror split

389
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,400
The pain of backlash has to be endured by me

390
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,119
how to ask

391
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
Is this fair to me

392
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:37,880
how is this possible

393
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
I've obviously been beaten

394
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,239
when you're being attacked

395
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,119
I also suffer

396
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,599
funny

397
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,439
I've never asked for any power

398
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,079
But

399
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,680
But I have to bear the pain of backlash for you in vain

400
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,599
why

401
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,640
Back then I rescued you under the nine-headed bird

402
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,760
Why did I get it

403
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,079
but this consequence

404
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,839
what should i do then

405
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,640
can ease your pain

406
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,839
I want you to give up the mirror split

407
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:29,359
or you die

408
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,239
I can stop pain

409
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,520
You come

410
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,079
just want me to die

411
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,760
if not

412
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,560
Do you think I'm here to meet you?

413
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,800
what exactly do you want

414
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm going to take all your power

415
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,439
i want you to die now

416
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:21,880
I should pay off what I owe

417
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,920
Sir, are you there?

418
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,239
Little Lord

419
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,079
what's the matter

420
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,400
The old minister has something important to ask

421
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,560
you came right

422
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,599
There was an assassin trying to kill me just now

423
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,640
But I've been subdued

424
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,760
who's that person

425
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,280
how he got into the camp

426
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,160
my half-brother Suno

427
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,800
Then why did he assassinate the young master?

428
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,199
because of hate

429
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,560
How should the young master deal with him now?

430
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,880
leave him alone

431
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,439
He won't wake up for a while

432
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,800
Call everyone to the meeting room and wait for me

433
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:08,239
Young Master has something important to announce

434
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,599
Why are you asking so much?

435
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,719
don't do it soon

436
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,000
Yes Yes

437
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,479
Si Shi

438
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:04,079
Why do I always feel uneasy

439
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:07,920
Did something happen to Su Mo?

440
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,319
Bai Ying

441
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,239
no respond

442
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,560
should i go find him

443
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,439
Neptune

444
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:35,800
Si Shi

445
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,520
where is this

446
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,680
You were injured by Suno

447
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,880
I can only protect you here

448
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,920
Sir, I must go out

449
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,479
I'm afraid that Su Nuo will be bad for Quanxian

450
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,119
I have to stop him

451
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:51,640
Sea Emperor, your poison penetrates deep into your spiritual consciousness

452
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:54,800
If you forcibly wake up, you will be in danger of life

453
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:56,839
anyway

454
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,680
I'm going out to stop him

455
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,239
i figured it out

456
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,760
ok i'll take you out

457
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
but please remember

458
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,120
you are the king

459
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,600
anyway

460
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,199
You have to bring Quan back to Biluohai first

461
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,040
don't hesitate don't be afraid

462
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,080
Thank you Mr. Si

463
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,120
I will give you the strength to take you back

464
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,120
Why can't I summon the arrogant master?

465
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,040
Si Shi

466
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,840
what happened to you

467
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,479
Little Lord

468
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,199
Lord, call us here

469
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,439
What is there to announce?

470
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:18,000
Summon all the soldiers of Quan Xianjun

471
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,399
leave now

472
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:20,919
Attack Cangliu

473
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,320
Lord, leave now

474
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,879
Have an attack plan

475
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,719
How should we attack

476
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,520
Don't you want to go back to Biluohai?

477
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,959
How can I go back without attacking Cangliu?

478
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,800
But if you attack rashly, I am afraid there is no chance of victory.

479
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,719
you don't believe me

480
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,080
Of course we believe in the young master

481
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,000
But compared with the Cangliu Army

482
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,919
Our Quan Xianjun is from the military

483
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,479
It's not an advantage

484
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,679
Keep saying that you want to go back to Biluohai

485
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:02,239
As a result, no one was willing to contribute

486
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,280
good

487
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,239
From today onwards, don't go back to Biluohai again.

488
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,679
Little Lord

489
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,719
what's wrong with you today

490
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,679
Why did you make such a big decision all of a sudden?

491
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,439
Why don't we discuss it again

492
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
Yes, my lord

493
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,959
let's discuss

494
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:24,439
what to discuss

495
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,239
I am the emperor of the sea, I have the final say

496
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,159
Suno

497
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,560
Stop messing around with Suno

498
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,000
what nonsense are you talking about

499
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,679
take him down

500
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,959
How can there be two sea emperors?

501
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,719
What the hell is going on here?

502
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,679
This is his illusion

503
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,120
take him down

504
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,479
don't do it

505
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,479
before getting to the truth

506
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,840
Quan Xianjun could not fight internally

507
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,560
Isn't that the big brother who was healed by us?

508
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:32,560
How did he get into a fight with the sea emperor?

509
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,199
You recovered much faster than I expected

510
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:37,399
why do it

511
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,320
you are not thinking

512
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,000
Do you want to bring Quan back to Biluohai first?

513
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
i'm doing this

514
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,919
Su Nuo, who are you controlled by?

515
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:48,280
control

516
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,159
no one can control me

517
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,199
You are not inherently bad

518
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,320
Stop being obsessed

519
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,479
Come back to Biluohai with me

520
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,719
Ever since you abandoned me

521
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,919
I have nothing to do with Quan Xian anymore.

522
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,959
The prey saved me

523
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,600
prey

524
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:25,120
It's me you're dealing with

525
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
you let go of my brother

526
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,520
Su Nuo, do you want to be the emperor of the sea

527
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,679
just kill him

528
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,879
don't listen to him

529
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,320
Don't be under his control

530
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,479
Only you have absolute power

531
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:42,639
to control your own destiny

532
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,000
Arnold

533
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,760
only i can help you

534
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,000
become the new emperor

535
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,399
Useless things

536
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:10,600
Arnold

537
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,800
Why is the young master on fire?

538
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,199
Master, will it be alright?

539
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,919
Master, what's the matter

540
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,520
His backlash has dissipated

541
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,919
past life

542
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,840
The young master is under the help of the Dragon God

543
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,040
Inherit all the memory and power of the sea emperors of the past dynasties

544
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,080
The young master can obtain the power of the dragon god

545
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,479
The young master has obtained the power of the Dragon God

546
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:59,719
Great we can finally go home

547
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,639
Yes

548
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,360
Blood of the Dragon God

549
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,919
finally reconciled

550
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,600
It's so good

551
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,719
Great we are saved

552
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,760
we can go home

553
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,639
Very good

554
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,199
The young master has inherited the power of the Dragon God

555
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,639
and the golden body of the emperor of the sea

556
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:44,120
Meet the King of the Sea Meet the King of the Sea

557
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:01,320
see you safe and sound

558
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,280
I'm relieved

559
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:04,879
get up

560
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,919
congratulations, sea emperor, congratulations, sea emperor

561
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:18,560
Congratulations to Haihuang for getting the power of the Dragon God

562
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
Congratulations to Haihuang

563
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Is this the price I get power for?

564
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,600
lose brother

565
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,040
Losing you

566
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,840
why did you bring me to your room

567
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,280
The most dangerous place is the safest place

568
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,600
No one thought you'd hide here

569
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,360
It's a hell of a lot out there

570
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,040
where can you escape

571
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm only here to hurt you

572
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,040
If Master Shi Lang knew about it

573
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,399
I won't let you go

574
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,239
implicated in my feather fantasy

575
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:18,080
Is this the first time you implicated me?

576
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,959
You must listen to me this time
