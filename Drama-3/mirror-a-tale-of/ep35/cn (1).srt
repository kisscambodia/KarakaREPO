1
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,559
Ya burning

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,480
you are born

3
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:50,959
Chunhuang, I did something wrong

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,480
Ya Ran, please tell me
watch at kisskh.me

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
who is this person

6
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,440
Ya Ran, don't be sad

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,839
Although you can't be with him

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,279
But you have to take good care of yourself

9
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,639
I know Bai Wei

10
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,759
By the way, Chunhuang?

11
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,639
how is he

12
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,119
since we parted

13
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,559
Chun Huang, he has changed a lot

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,440
In the past, he hated dealing with Quanxian's affairs.

15
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,399
Now I only care about those

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,520
But now Quanxian is prosperous and healthy

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,000
It is beyond the reach of Kongsang

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
This is all thanks to Chunhuang

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,720
But he only had Quan Xian in his heart

20
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,039
Never married a queen

21
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,320
He was born too

22
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,000
what kind of woman

23
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,440
the woman

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,279
He lost her after all

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,199
what a pity

26
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,559
But I really want to go to Longxiao Palace again

27
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,720
You will always be Quanxian's most popular guest

28
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
pure brilliance

29
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,639
we all miss you

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,440
Bai Wei, I'm leaving first

31
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,199
tonight

32
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,880
Just stay here and have a good rest

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,080
you're going to drink alone

34
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,199
It was sent by your maidservant.

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,759
Her Royal Highness said it was the Queen's favorite thing

36
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,839
I know everything, Alang

37
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,559
Bai Wei drinking on an empty stomach is bad for your health

38
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,800
so

39
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,360
How about I drink with you another day

40
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,520
Kings

41
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
How is Princess Yaran

42
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,839
she talked to the queen for a moment

43
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,880
I went to the side hall to rest.

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
nothing unusual

45
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,679
keep an eye on her

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,440
In addition, the envoy Izumi Izumi visited

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,119
What can be said inside and outside the palace

48
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,920
Envoys visit Mirror City

49
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,320
All the ministers and the people appreciate it

50
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,959
Said they had never seen it before

51
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,600
Quanxian has so many rare treasures

52
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,440
Eye-opening today

53
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,359
What can the six kings say?

54
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,279
The subordinates are attending the banquet today

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,359
Hear the Six Kings Talk

56
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,160
Among them, Qing Wang has quite a view on the alliance

57
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,959
Qing Wang determined that Quanxian was seeking peace on the surface

58
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,079
actually provocative

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,760
Quanxian's wealth far surpassed Kongsang

60
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,559
Kongsang has been built

61
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,160
But the treasury is empty

62
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Although the king has a martial art

63
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,320
But not as wise as the sea emperor

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
What else did the king say?

65
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,200
King Qing also said

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,160
if you can agree with him sooner

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,720
To attack Izumi's request

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,799
the king the king

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
king queen she

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,880
what's wrong with her

71
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,239
The queen was poisoned in a coma

72
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,320
what

73
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,880
She treats you like a sister

74
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
You want to poison her

75
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,799
really vicious

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,880
Why are you laughing

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,959
I never thought of harming sister Bai Wei

78
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,440
all i want is your life

79
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,519
You gave her the poisoned wine with your own hands

80
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,040
you want to kill me

81
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,079
that wine

82
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,760
Yes

83
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
I regret saving you

84
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,799
Over the years, you have fought against the cloud

85
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,279
On the surface, it is for the tranquility of Yunhuang

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,839
what you do

87
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,480
Can't hide your wolf ambitions at all

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,679
After the sixth part, you have your eyes on Quan Xian

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,839
you are jealous

90
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,160
Sister Bai Wei has always had my brother Chun Huang in her heart

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,480
You are more coveted by Quanxian's wealth

92
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,399
you shut up

93
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,760
I jealous

94
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,720
i cove

95
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,000
You don't know it yourself

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,959
Your eyes have already changed

97
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,920
You are not at all

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,839
I know you

99
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,880
It's you who have changed

100
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,119
What do you want to take away my queen?

101
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,720
What alliance is trying to show my incompetence

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Now you still want to kill me

103
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,799
I hate

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,320
can't die with you

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,480
I have ancient power in hand

106
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,160
In the seven seas, the cloud and the deserted six are my king's land

107
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,600
Then I'll let you take a good look

108
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,160
how do i

109
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,040
Stepping on Izumi first

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,519
The queen is bad

111
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,600
The king leads his troops to Biluohai

112
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,640
I'm going to talk to Quan first.

113
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,679
What did you say

114
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,559
the king said

115
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,440
The poison poisoned by the queen was poisoned by Ya Ran

116
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,359
he wants

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
nonsense

118
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,920
How could Ya Ran poison me?

119
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,040
go get my armor

120
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,600
Queen, you just woke up

121
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,359
go quickly

122
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:05,959
Yes

123
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,480
I have to stop Arang

124
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,440
must stop him

125
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,160
Neptune

126
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,079
King Kongsang has already killed the blue seaside

127
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,359
He said

128
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,679
He said that Princess Yaran poisoned Queen Baiwei

129
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,320
Said to step on Hiraizumi to avenge the queen first

130
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
If you want to fight

131
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,799
How can you send troops without a name

132
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,479
Neptune

133
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,840
Now is the last year of the Dragon God's transformation

134
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,520
Without the protection of the Dragon God

135
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,799
We can't fight back

136
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,400
Besides

137
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:49,520
Besides, he has the power of the emperor in his hand.

138
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
against

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,520
Yes

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,760
Langgan

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,760
you said that day

142
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,200
I just want the peace of Yunhuang

143
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,479
Why are you still fighting around

144
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,239
you are perfidious

145
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:26,719
kill him kill him

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,280
you are wrong

147
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,719
Possessing great power will not bring disaster

148
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,960
Quanxian has become where he is today

149
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,200
because of people's hearts

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,520
Because of

151
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,119
your desire

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
what do you mean

153
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,640
My spring ancestors have lived in Longxiao Palace for generations

154
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
Although the dragon god blesses

155
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,679
But never thought of being an enemy of others

156
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,799
but

157
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,359
you fell in love with the woman you shouldn't love

158
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,880
You even tried to take her away from me

159
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,640
Avi told me

160
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,119
She asked you to send me a letter

161
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,559
But

162
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,559
I have never received any letters

163
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,599
When I arrive at Longxiao Palace

164
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,159
You even let Ya Ran trap me

165
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,239
And this time

166
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,000
You even poisoned her

167
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,000
what are you thinking

168
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,760
Bai Wei asked me to deliver the letter

169
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,960
I did hesitate

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,880
But the letter has already been sent

171
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,919
And what you said about the burning and poisoning

172
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,640
i don't know

173
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,119
That's right

174
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,039
I really love Bai Wei

175
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,080
But

176
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,280
I never thought about taking her away

177
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
I didn't even think about hurting her

178
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,679
I didn't even express

179
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,919
my love for her

180
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,880
because I know

181
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,000
in her heart

182
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,400
She loves only you

183
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,960
If I hadn't arrived in time

184
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,520
You're going to keep her with you, right?

185
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,880
you can't get her
watch at kisskh.me

186
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,400
even less visible

187
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,799
I will spend this life with her in peace

188
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,440
These are all excuses for you to challenge Quanxian.

189
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,599
Langgan

190
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,640
I thought you were pure in nature

191
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,119
Can suppress the magic of the sign

192
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,960
you have lost your mind

193
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,200
You are not the same you used to be

194
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,119
kill him kill him

195
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,280
no matter what i become

196
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,760
I can do everything for Bai Wei

197
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,280
I can share the world with her

198
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,119
But I want to make her world

199
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:29,159
no more you

200
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,960
Avi

201
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,880
How can you point your sword at me

202
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,719
why are you doing this
watch at kisskh.me

203
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,840
I want to make an argument for you

204
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:53,760
make an argument for me

205
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you referring to Ya Ran's poisoning?

206
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,799
Well I ask you

207
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,679
Why do you think Ya Ran will poison me

208
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,679
she

209
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,479
i ask you again

210
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,000
The cloud shortage has been pacified for several years

211
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,359
It will take time to get the whole army out

212
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,960
why am i poisoned

213
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,200
You immediately lead the army to go to Quanxian

214
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,559
Langgan

215
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,760
You have long planned to conquer Quanxian.

216
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,799
what ya burn poison

217
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,919
It's all your excuses

218
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,359
Ya burn is kind-hearted

219
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,479
would not do such a thing at all

220
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,479
shut up

221
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:37,359
alang

222
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,400
you do not believe me

223
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,239
if it was you

224
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,080
I will definitely believe

225
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,520
But now you've changed

226
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,880
Kong Sang can have today

227
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,119
All rely on Chunhuang to help

228
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
you do

229
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,479
You're doing this to avenge

230
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,520
his help

231
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,080
He's clearly thinking

232
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,200
how did you become like this

233
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,039
the world in your eyes

234
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,159
how can it be so dark

235
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,320
I am fine too

236
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,919
Ya Ran is also good

237
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,200
It's all an excuse for you to go to Quanxian.

238
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,280
When you hold high the sword

239
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,559
Do you remember this sword

240
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,280
It was originally given to us by Chunhuang

241
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:04,239
Let us pacify and protect the cloud

242
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,080
now

243
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,559
We have achieved our original intention

244
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,119
But what about you

245
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,200
You still don't want to put away this heaven-defying sword

246
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,479
You would rather listen to King Qing's slander

247
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,320
You even aimed your sword at Quanxian

248
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:24,320
Actually trying to seal the Dragon God

249
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,159
are you crazy

250
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,159
Without the blessing of the Dragon God

251
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,239
From now on

252
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,000
will obey from generation to generation

253
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080
won't fight anymore

254
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,960
You killed Quan Xian today

255
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,679
another day

256
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,239
Kongsang must be destroyed by others

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,159
When will this back and forth stop

258
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,159
what are you doing

259
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,200
you are no longer what you used to be

260
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,640
the one i know

261
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,719
follow my childhood sweetheart

262
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,679
Good astrologer Ah Lang

263
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,799
It's the King of Stars that I don't know

264
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,599
The back soil ring

265
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,880
i give you back

266
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,400
Queen of Houtu ring

267
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,719
You can pick it up if you want

268
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,479
You are the queen of Kongsang

269
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,680
you are my queen

270
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,319
nowadays

271
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,319
Betrayed me for an outsider

272
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,239
this day and this place

273
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,479
These seven seas, this cloudless desert

274
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,920
I share everything with you

275
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,319
why do you do this

276
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,239
this day and earth

277
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,079
how can it be our everything

278
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:37,880
alang

279
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,199
You don't get obsessed anymore

280
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,400
let it go

281
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,839
Avi

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,599
why did you betray me

283
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,680
because of him

284
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,800
kill Chunhuang

285
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,640
all this will end

286
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Bai Wei only belongs to me

287
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,839
how so

288
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,160
the phantom

289
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,160
Locked the three of us inside

290
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,479
if i don't wake up

291
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:11,880
if i don't wake up

292
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,680
The Heavenly Sword will look like it was 7,000 years ago

293
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,160
Killing Queen Baiwei

294
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,119
kill Bai Ying

295
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,280
i have to wake up

296
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,000
i have to wake up

297
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,280
Bai Ying Bai Ying

298
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,119
wake up

299
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,439
Bai Ying, wake up

300
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,319
What's up with her

301
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,640
She should still be in the hallucination

302
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,160
Bai Wei

303
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,400
Bai Ying

304
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,880
Su G, you finally woke up

305
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,760
why are you here

306
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,680
not long ago

307
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,680
I was sucked in by a beam of light

308
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,079
result

309
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,680
This sword is in my hands

310
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:06,000
And I'm holding the Heaven-defying sword

311
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,880
With you in calming the cloud

312
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,359
you saw the vision too

313
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,640
things in fantasy

314
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,319
Did you not know

315
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,599
Previously in the tomb of Jiuyi Xingzunwang

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,959
I have seen the scene before Queen Bai Wei died

317
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,599
but i don't know

318
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,760
I am the one with the sword

319
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:24,839
wrong

320
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,920
Langgan

321
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,680
why didn't you tell us

322
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,479
You have seen the picture in the vision

323
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,280
And how did you come here all of a sudden

324
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,079
After you leave

325
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,760
I looked at the parchment repeatedly

326
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,280
what did you find

327
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,959
The parchment has these words written on it

328
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,359
On the same day we met in the trapped Longyuan

329
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,680
You give up your precepts and I go home alone

330
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,959
all day long

331
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,760
I can't wait for you to return

332
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,800
Clear tears and two lines of empty sadness

333
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,560
I didn't feel anything wrong at the time

334
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,520
But after watching it repeatedly

335
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,959
more and more uneasy

336
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,239
Especially those three words

337
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,319
You fade away

338
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,839
just expected

339
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:09,040
The past in this trapped dragon must be complicated

340
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,920
So I came over

341
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,920
Unexpectedly, it almost hurt you

342
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,800
that we have seen in visions

343
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,000
maybe not an illusion

344
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:23,400
but the truth

345
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:27,439
Did not you say

346
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,959
Have you always had a pair of eyes looking at us?

347
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,880
maybe the eyes

348
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,839
the one who took us into the illusion

349
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,719
you mean those eyes are

350
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,160
Queen Baiwei

351
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,319
phantasmagoria

352
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,280
Almost made the three of us kill each other

353
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,239
Or hurry up and find the sleepy dragon lock

354
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,359
Isn't that sleepy dragon lock right there?

355
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,560
Where is the sleepy dragon lock

356
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,839
Here is the Sleepy Dragon

357
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,280
How could this enchantment stop the fire formation?

358
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe this sleepy dragon cable is the same as the Xuanhuangjing

359
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,599
only you can see

360
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,319
then i try

361
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,680
Or let you go one step ahead

362
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
You are not too late

363
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
If it weren't for those few Quanxian soldiers to cause chaos

364
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I'm already here

365
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,439
what did you do to them

366
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,719
Have you heard of the poison of the ghost red Yan?

367
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,359
It's now spread all over the waters of the county

368
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,520
no one is spared

369
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,599
And your left-right envoy Yan Xi

370
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:06,040
Guess he's dead or alive now

371
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,280
Including that spy Xiao

372
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,319
mean

373
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,760
Seriously, will I be deceived by you all the time?

374
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,359
Su G

375
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,280
you go to unseal

376
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,760
Give this man to me

377
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,479
Your Highness

378
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,439
Don't worry, it's alright

379
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,839
I'd like to see

380
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,400
How powerful is Prince Kong Sang

381
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,880
Dragon God who has been covered in dust for thousands of years

382
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,119
Finally see the sun again

383
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,400
This trapped dragon has been untied

384
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,760
Why hasn't the Dragon God come out yet?

385
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,640
Dragon God is at his feet

386
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,439
It turns out that the reef that was trapped in Longyuan for a week

387
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:01,239
the Dragon God

388
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,839
Why cut off the sleepy dragon cord?

389
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,839
Dragon God is not out yet

390
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:10,880
Dragon God

391
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:12,959
I am the emperor

392
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm here to save you

393
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,400
Is it not enough to cut off the trapped dragon rope?

394
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,680
How can I rescue the dragon god?

395
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,680
I've been waiting for you for a long time

396
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,040
You only come when Kongsang is destroyed

397
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,760
Queen Baiwei

398
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,560
I can stay in the trapped dragon for seven thousand years

399
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,920
Thanks to this back soil ring on your hand

400
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,119
see you

401
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:56,000
It's like seeing us back then

402
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
What are the illusions we see?

403
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,640
What you see is real

404
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,719
That was seven thousand years ago

405
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,040
A piece of the past between me, Chunhuang Langgan

406
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,920
Whenever I think of what Lang Gan looked like at that time

407
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,359
I can't believe it

408
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,680
my memory is real

409
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,040
jealousy and ambition

410
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,520
will expand the dark side of people

411
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,959
make people crazy

412
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,359
Zhengquan seals Biluohai first

413
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,359
Ling Quan's ancestors left their homes for generations

414
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,959
fortitude becomes stubborn

415
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,439
Love becomes domination

416
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,719
The advantages of Langgan's original character

417
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:48,239
unknowingly become twisted

418
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
became that

419
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,280
people i don't know

420
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:55,439
Since he found you in Biluohai

421
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,119
Since then

422
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,520
Everyone's fate has changed

423
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,760
an irresistible fate

424
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,760
Let's go this way

425
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,359
What I want for Yunhuang is peace

426
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,839
And what he wants is domination, conquest

427
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,400
While we take our swords to the flames of war

428
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:22,119
We are destined to reach these two ends

429
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,119
Is fate really irresistible?

430
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,359
opened

431
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,959
this water mirror

432
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,439
Bai Wei

433
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,160
do you still want to come out

434
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:39,680
Avi

435
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,920
According to the Xuanhuangjing records

436
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,160
The seal of the Dragon God can be unlocked with the Heaven-defying Sword

437
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,359
But now the sleepy dragon rope has been broken

438
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,959
Why hasn't the Dragon God come out yet?

439
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,839
Dragon God has two seals on his body

440
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,760
One is set up by Alang

441
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,959
This is the sleepy dragon

442
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,599
for the dragon god

443
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,319
Trapped in the trapped dragon forever

444
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:05,920
There is another one that I set

445
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,959
At that time, Alang sealed the dragon god

446
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,239
I'm afraid the dragon god will be destroyed

447
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,359
Use half the power of the back earth

448
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,439
Created a seal for the Dragon God

449
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,800
protect it forever

450
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,640
And the other half of the power

451
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,599
left it in your back soil ring

452
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,119
Bai Wei

453
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,800
how so

454
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,239
I did not do it on purpose

455
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,920
Avi why are you

456
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,520
May I die without closing my eyes

457
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,920
see when you die

458
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:05,560
Bai Wei, stop talking

459
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,680
Avi, I didn't mean to

460
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,239
me

461
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,640
It's all Na Chunhuang

462
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,359
without him

463
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,079
you will always be my queen

464
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,760
yes he is

465
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,040
It's all his fault

466
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,880
I'm going to kill him

467
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,079
pure brilliance

468
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,839
I can't release the dragon god

469
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,760
But I will protect the Dragon God for you

470
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,680
As long as the Dragon God is there

471
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,079
Quan Xian will not die

472
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:38,919
don't fight again

473
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,159
He killed Avi

474
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,320
kill him

475
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,199
I can get everything in Yunhuang

476
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,000
Queen Baiwei

477
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,199
What do we have to do to free the dragon god

478
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,520
follow me

479
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,679
put your hand on

480
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:24,879
why can't i open it

481
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,399
concentrate

482
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:30,159
Concentrate mana on the Houtu God Ring

483
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,080
Be careful

484
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,199
I have endured so much suffering for hundreds of years

485
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,080
i can't give up

486
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,679
Quanxian's Dragon God

487
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,679
We finally meet again

488
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,879
seven thousand years

489
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,520
finally wait

490
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,719
The moment I unseal the seal for you

491
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm here to correct the mistakes of the year

492
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:44,919
Dragon God is angry

493
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,760
it must remember

494
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,560
At the beginning, Chunhuang was the dragon's tooth to get for me

495
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,639
what should we do now

496
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:01,360
Unlock the seal and let the dragon god fly out

497
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Queen Baiwei, please lend me your strength

498
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,479
let me release the dragon god

499
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,239
It's nature to lend you strength

500
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,520
Only you can inherit my power

501
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,840
you used to be half spiritual

502
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,879
Open the colorless city

503
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,399
But with your present body

504
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,159
wanna get my power

505
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,280
need to pay a huge price

506
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,120
give your most precious

507
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,479
Do you want to

508
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,120
Did you just hit a feather?

509
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,280
The poison of ghost red Yan

510
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,280
I promise you no matter what

511
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,479
For Quan, first for Su G

512
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:49,479
Don't let the past regrets and mistakes

513
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,439
continued

514
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:24,840
Queen Baiwei, I'm ready

515
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:27,760
good

516
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,159
my descendants

517
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,280
You've got all my power

518
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,479
Go and release the dragon god

519
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,199
Let the dragon god recognize the sea emperor

520
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,040
I should be gone too

521
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,639
Kongsang and Yunhuang

522
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,800
I'll leave it to you

523
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,679
Avi

524
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:14,439
You still want to switch to me

525
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,040
The seal of the Dragon God is about to be unlocked

526
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,320
Climb up and kill Su G

527
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,840
Why is it always me who is abandoned and hurt

528
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,520
Why

529
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:49,120
Bai Ying

530
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,520
Bai Ying

531
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:53,040
What the hell did you just do?

532
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,439
To unlock the seal of the Dragon God

533
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,439
It's the only way

534
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,040
Back then when King Xingzun sealed the Dragon God

535
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:05,639
Now it should also be the descendants of my Kong Sangbai clan

536
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
to break the seal
