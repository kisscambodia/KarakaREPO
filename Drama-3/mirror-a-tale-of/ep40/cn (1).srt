1
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,319
so that drug

2
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,040
Is it really just for beauty?

3
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:58,599
Yes

4
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,279
But don't use that medicine

5
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,559
if you need it

6
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,639
I can make some others for you

7
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,240
what do you think

8
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,759
I'm a martial artist who doesn't need these

9
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,199
Then I'll go back and get some healing medicine

10
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,559
spare for you

11
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,600
No

12
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,720
A Yuan

13
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,360
You see you always frown

14
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,960
brows furrowed

15
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Sister Hongyuan

16
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,199
Who is this

17
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,119
blue summer blue king

18
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
You are

19
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,360
Repair

20
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,639
blue king know me

21
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,399
do not know

22
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,759
I want to find Aying

23
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,279
then say goodbye

24
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I go with you

25
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,240
If you want me to believe you

26
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,039
you have to tell me first

27
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,919
What's with that bottle of medicine?

28
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,520
What kind of medicine? I don't know

29
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,800
It was discovered by Bai Ying

30
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
she's worried about you

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,559
Want to know what the hell is that bottle of medicine?

32
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,399
You told your sister about the medicine

33
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,000
what happened to you

34
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,320
I took the medicine myself

35
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,640
Since Jiuyi Mountain broke the enchantment

36
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,359
I can no longer live by sucking weak water

37
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,519
I am bird spirit

38
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,600
If you want to continue living

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,679
Do not take weak water

40
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,239
to eat other living things

41
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,600
I've always wanted to be human

42
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,760
how can i do these again

43
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,160
what evil things do

44
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,679
If you don't drink weak water

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,920
will get old

46
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,519
Until death

47
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,920
That bottle won't last long.

48
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,760
don't tell your sister

49
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,079
My sister hurts me the most

50
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,839
up to now

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,040
She thinks I'm a little girl

52
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,799
how can i bear

53
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,519
Let her watch me grow old little by little

54
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
Then slowly die

55
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
what are your plans

56
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,760
The second day of the Flower God Festival is my birthday

57
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
wait until then

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,920
I'll find a place to die alone

59
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,799
I can't last long with that bottle of medicine alone.

60
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,160
I can help you

61
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,480
why help me

62
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,359
if you have something

63
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,239
Bai Ying will be sad too

64
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,040
Zhixiu said that this is really just a medicine to keep your face

65
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,440
don't think too much

66
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,239
Lin'er has also grown up

67
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,040
It's normal to have a love for beauty

68
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,839
Or maybe she's in love with someone

69
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,480
So there is no need to have a love for beauty.

70
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,519
Anyway, you're a sister

71
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,200
don't worry too much

72
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,760
how can they be together

73
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,320
take it

74
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,640
The medicine only lasts for one day

75
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,160
Healing here every night

76
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,399
I will wait for you

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,600
did not expect

78
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,959
In the end, it was you who kept helping me

79
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,480
I used to hate you so much

80
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,399
You don't remember hating me at all?

81
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,119
I just don't want to waste time

82
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,519
on unimportant matters

83
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,920
you still hate it

84
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,359
But now

85
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,559
I seem to understand

86
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,640
why does my sister like you

87
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Give you

88
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,760
Star Soul Sea Oath is Kongsang's highest-level spell

89
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,679
Once implemented

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,159
Can be the same as the wheel of life and death

91
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,239
Performing this technique is like holding a torch against the wind

92
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,559
There will be burns

93
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,440
Can't be used unless it is desperate

94
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,640
This technique uses blood as the carrier, supplemented by chanting its mantra

95
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
to conclude

96
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,799
are you sure you want to use it

97
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,960
that's my thing

98
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,479
what about the spell

99
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
I'll figure it out myself

100
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,119
The last thing I want to admit

101
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,359
just my sister

102
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,080
no wrong person

103
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,760
Will he fall in love with anyone else

104
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,640
And I'm putting my feelings on a person

105
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,599
completely forgot

106
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,080
will fall in love with him again

107
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:32,840
A Ying

108
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,000
Why are you here alone?

109
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,000
Your Highness, why are you here?

110
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,320
I open the water mirror

111
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,799
I want to see the situation around

112
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,440
but see you here alone

113
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,200
come and see

114
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,280
what happened to you

115
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,000
i'm fine

116
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,640
His Royal Highness Lau

117
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:55,840
you

118
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,440
Is it because of Su G?

119
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,359
no

120
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:05,080
It's because I haven't seen Lin'er for a long time

121
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,599
Just some emotion

122
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,799
A Ying

123
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,080
Loving someone is impossible to hide

124
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,520
We have made a lot of progress in the past hundred years

125
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,840
also lived more years than others

126
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,000
in these long years

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,919
What sustains our existence is nothing else

128
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,559
but emotion

129
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,039
Companionship among the Six Kings

130
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,960
The monarch-subject relationship between me and Xijing

131
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,239
not brotherhood

132
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,960
because of feelings

133
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,719
So it makes more sense

134
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,440
Your Highness means

135
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,559
I mean

136
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,599
No matter how much responsibility we have

137
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,960
There are more tasks to be done

138
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:15,559
But we are ordinary people

139
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,840
we have to face it truthfully

140
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,000
our own emotions

141
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,479
Aying's sad words

142
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,760
It's better to cry

143
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,919
Nasheng

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,799
I'm sorry I'm not good

145
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,640
I shouldn't be mad at you

146
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,679
It is my fault

147
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,919
I shouldn't pester you to let you play with me

148
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,599
you feel bad

149
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,119
I should be more considerate of you

150
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,479
It's all my fault, I shouldn't

151
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,159
Forget it, I don't blame you

152
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
I am so generous

153
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,080
you really don't get mad at me anymore

154
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,840
I won't tell you so much if I'm angry

155
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,960
Then we can't go out today

156
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,080
If you don't, teach me archery

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,679
take the middle

158
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,640
Are you OK

159
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Su G, why are you here?

160
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,119
Why didn't you come to heal last night?

161
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,679
I'm afraid I can't

162
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,080
Or tell Bai Ying about her?

163
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:39,919
Su G

164
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,919
You want to save your sister with the Star Soul Sea Oath

165
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,280
pay such a high price

166
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,239
will you tell her

167
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,559
you are the same as me

168
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,400
we don't want to

169
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,359
Let the most beloved for us

170
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,479
suffer a shred of damage

171
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,239
I'll heal you first

172
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,599
Liner

173
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,039
What happened to you

174
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,280
How are you

175
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,239
elder sister

176
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,359
you always knew

177
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,000
You've been helping her hide from me

178
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,640
That bottle of medicine is not a beauty-preserving medicine at all.

179
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,200
Come out and talk

180
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,440
take a rest

181
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,200
Come

182
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,320
Lin'er has been hiding from me all the time

183
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
She just thought of a birthday with her sister

184
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,000
So it's been up until now

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,239
What about that bottle of medicine

186
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,479
It's a medicine to maintain your appearance

187
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,599
Liner, she always wanted to change from a bird spirit to a human being

188
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,039
But I can't help her

189
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,479
Before in Jiuyi Mountain

190
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,919
She didn't feed on living things

191
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,000
This means she would rather choose to die

192
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,679
Don't be a demon

193
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,679
have such a will

194
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,799
Even the body of a bird

195
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,640
How is it different from people?

196
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,239
Su G

197
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,239
Do you know what saddens me the most?

198
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,000
I know that

199
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,119
Lin'er, she's going away

200
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,719
But I can't do anything

201
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,119
I even my own beloved

202
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
can't protect

203
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm sorry Liner

204
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,719
Sister knows too late

205
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,479
have what

206
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,800
I can do it for you

207
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,439
what else do you wish for

208
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,880
Sister can do it for you

209
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,680
you haven't left

210
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,520
Bai Lin how is she?

211
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,520
still the same

212
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,680
Don't know what else to do for her

213
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,400
Is Flower Festival really that important to her?

214
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
The second day of the Flower God Festival is her birthday

215
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,479
the day before

216
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,880
We always go to the flower god tree to pray and make a wish

217
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,560
But in her current state

218
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,880
I'm afraid I can't go

219
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Since she can't go

220
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,160
We can help her create a flower festival

221
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,319
are you here

222
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,079
you go take care of her first

223
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,319
leave other things to me

224
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,359
I didn't even think of Yanxi

225
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,199
So many things will happen during this time

226
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,359
I didn't even think

227
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,920
Brother Ice Cube will do it for Sister Bai Lin

228
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,800
do so many things

229
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,839
Are you saying that Sister Bai Lin is really going to die?

230
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,640
She's so pathetic

231
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,839
so young to die

232
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,680
if i

233
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,839
I will definitely not be reconciled

234
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,439
You said she just came back from Jiuyi Mountain

235
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,199
Yanxi

236
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,280
are you listening to me

237
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,599
why do you keep walking

238
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,079
heard it

239
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,040
Why didn't you answer me when you heard

240
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,719
Yanxi

241
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,079
why are you so weird lately

242
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,199
do you not like me

243
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,520
how can i not like you

244
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,319
you don't look like you like me

245
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,839
I tell you

246
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,319
You can't like someone else

247
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,599
and

248
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,000
you were born for me

249
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,160
You can only love one person in your life

250
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,239
do you know

251
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,319
I was born for you

252
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,760
right, isn't it?

253
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,959
Yes

254
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,000
Very good

255
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,920
we will be together forever

256
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,959
Yanxi, you must not do anything.

257
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,839
me

258
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,199
anyway anyway

259
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,479
I can't live without you anyway

260
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,119
Now that I recognize you

261
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,560
I will follow you forever

262
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,839
You can't dodge, you can't dodge

263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,880
if you dare to hide from me

264
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,560
i will follow you

265
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,239
But I always feel

266
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,479
You've been a little weird lately

267
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,839
Yanxi, do you have anything to say to me?

268
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,560
Na Sheng, my things fell off

269
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,560
don't care, don't care

270
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,359
Liner why are you up?

271
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,439
elder sister

272
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,760
where have you been

273
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
Su G came to find me just now

274
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,839
He said that he, Yan Xi and Na Sheng

275
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,119
I have something for you

276
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,719
to celebrate your birthday

277
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,520
very nice

278
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,000
I can have another birthday

279
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,520
correct

280
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,400
Su G said I prepared a wishing card for you

281
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,119
Wishing now is not what it used to be

282
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,599
Just write your wish on the wishing card

283
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,640
wishes come true

284
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,880
Liner, what do you wish for?

285
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:38,959
Sister help you write

286
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,959
what my sister wants to write for me

287
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,400
The wish fails

288
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,119
elder sister

289
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,640
the days to come

290
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,680
You must always be happy

291
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,239
Silly Liner

292
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,079
look

293
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,560
Our flower festival is about to start

294
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,719
so beautiful

295
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,319
so beautiful

296
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,640
Actually, the festival is not important

297
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,199
It's important

298
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,439
to be with my sister

299
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,640
I think

300
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:03,199
I have no regrets

301
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:07,560
make a wish

302
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,760
Sister, I'm so happy

303
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,599
It's nice to have you by my side

304
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,479
I hope you can accompany me every day

305
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,400
What did my sister wish for?

306
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,560
May all your wishes come true

307
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
you are cheating

308
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,479
This is my last wish

309
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,359
please bless

310
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,520
must be realized

311
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,119
i only have one wish

312
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,920
just hope

313
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,839
You and Su G will be fine

314
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,520
Auspicious birds in empty mulberry

315
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,199
Lin

316
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,800
take pleasure in filial piety

317
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,319
return home

318
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,079
Today, the auspicious bird is not very sad when it goes west

319
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,400
Bailin County Lord

320
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:35,760
I can finally return to the Valley of the Kings to rest in peace.

321
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,040
time flies

322
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,160
Yes, Lin'er's funeral has passed.

323
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,400
I see you are in a better mood than two days ago

324
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,760
I can't be in grief forever

325
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,280
life always goes on

326
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,520
and

327
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,280
Lin'er, she also wants me to smile more

328
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,640
it's supposed to be like this

329
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,000
But this time you can recover so fast

330
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,599
Really thanks to Su G's company

331
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,680
thanks to him

332
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,160
you still don't remember

333
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,719
everything before you

334
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,000
no

335
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,959
But I don't think it matters

336
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,160
Because whether I remember him or not

337
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,199
I know I have him in my heart

338
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,839
I just think he

339
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,599
Forget it, maybe I'm overthinking it

340
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,359
So have you told him your mind?

341
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,439
I

342
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,239
Do I need to tell him my mind again?

343
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:18,599
Of course you need it

344
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,359
You misunderstood so deeply

345
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,079
Going around for so long

346
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,199
It's killing me

347
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
But

348
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,839
I don't know what to say to him

349
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,479
you just tell him

350
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,880
what's on your mind

351
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,000
You missed so much before

352
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,640
This time, you must cherish the people in front of you

353
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:21,839
you find me

354
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,160
You came

355
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,880
I have something to tell you

356
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,359
What's up

357
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,680
before me

358
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,680
Always try your best to do everything

359
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,520
But everything is not done

360
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,319
yes to you

361
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,079
also to Kongsang

362
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,640
It's fine as long as you do it without shame

363
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
no i am ashamed

364
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,520
I am ashamed of you

365
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,560
ashamed of me

366
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,000
i forgot you

367
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:02,959
It's ok

368
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,119
even if you can't remember

369
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,079
I won't change you

370
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,400
I know

371
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,560
There are many good memories between us

372
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,640
But I can't remember anything

373
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,280
since i woke up

374
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,959
I've always been cold to you

375
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,239
then avoid you

376
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,640
I missed so many things before

377
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,959
also lost too much

378
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,400
I want to cherish the people in front of me

379
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,000
so

380
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,520
I don't want to dwell on the past anymore

381
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:02,839
I like you

382
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,839
Even if I forget everything

383
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,239
but i still like you

384
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:25,439
Didn't you hear what I'm talking about?

385
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,479
do you need me to say it again

386
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,199
i heard

387
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,479
I will never fail you

388
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,760
Ah Huan

389
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,199
Do you have to go to Jiuyi again?

390
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,040
I have one important thing to confirm

391
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,239
What are you going to confirm this time?

392
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,919
When I went to Jiuyi Mountain

393
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:23,439
I found a strange enchantment in Jiuyi Mountain

394
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,120
Only the Kongsang royal family

395
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,600
to get in there

396
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,320
I would like to know

397
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,719
Will there lead to the colorless city

398
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,760
Does Ah Huan have to confirm?

399
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:39,719

400
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,399
why don't we run away

401
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
have a quiet day

402
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:44,439
Just our siblings

403
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,479
sister

404
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,959
In fact, Lord of Prey

405
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,000
Didn't heal me

406
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,600
sorry phantom

407
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,040
Sister didn't protect you

408
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,360
So this time I have to go to Jiuyi Mountain

409
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,800
If that enchantment

410
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,159
If it really has something to do with the colorless city

411
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,560
I can use it

412
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,800
Make a deal with Lord of Prey

413
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,239
Only in this way

414
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,760
My Quanxian Blood Pact

415
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,040
It is possible to be completely healed

416
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,800
Until then

417
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,239
we are truly free

419
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,760
The men dispatched carried out another round of manhunt.

420
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,040
Still no trace of Yuhuan found

421
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,719
Immediately issue a warrant

Feather fantasy absconded

423
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,120
Once found

424
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,040
shoot to kill

425
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,239
Yes

426
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,159
Yuhuan is now a fugitive

427
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,919
as soon as he comes back

428
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,399
will fall into my net

429
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:54,520
And he has long been useless

430
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:56,919
The prey won't use him anymore

431
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,879
even if you can't find him

432
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:04,239
It will not hinder our next plan

Lord Shilang asks to see you

436
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,800
invite him in

437
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:18,199
Yes

438
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,000
Sir Shi Lang is a rare visitor

Nanzhao

440
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,360
you have been tired all day

441
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,199
go back and rest

442
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,080
Yes

443
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,560
Lord Shilang, speak directly if you have something to say

444
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,439
I don't know if Yuhuan found it

445
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,959
I should ask you this

446
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,679
He escaped from your house

447
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,840
Even if no one steals and gets

448
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:18,399
But Lord Shilang really doesn't know.

successive rebellions

452
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,520
You didn't send Nan Zhao to suppress

453
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,439
Lord of Prey has no instructions

454
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,879
What the hell is going on here?

455
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
you are afraid

456
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,639
Since the Lord of Prey began to reuse Yuhuan

457
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,000
to our five divisions

458
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,159
I don't care

459
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:08,520
What do you think this Lord of Prey is thinking?

460
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:17,600
instead of wondering what he was thinking

461
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,159
better let him

462
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,360
want nothing

463
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,000
Master Shi Peng really had a plan.

we have a chance

468
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:54,600
I don't know

469
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,560
Can I join in too?

470
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,159
There is a change in this enchantment, why is there no one?

471
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,040
Yes

472
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,000
Go and report to Qing Wang

473
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,919
good yes

474
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,280

00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,560
i gotta hurry up

00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,959
Your Highness Qingyuan is here to report

486
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,479
