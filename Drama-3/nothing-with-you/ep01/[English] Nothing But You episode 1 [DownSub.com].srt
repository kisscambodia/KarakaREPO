00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,930

189
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,660
Alright, here you are.

190
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,420
Go home!

191
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,380
She's so grumpy!

192
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,020
We're not like natural sisters,

193
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,580
except that we look alike.

194
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,900
Unlike me...

195
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,460
Sister!

196
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,460

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,409

OK, understand.

204
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,820
There was a situation.

205
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,740
She can't make it now.

206
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,140
I have an important schedule afterwards.

207
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,260
If Miss Bi can't make it today,

208
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,300
then we'll sign the contract some other day.

209
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,580
Hello, Dennis.

210
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,060
I am the Administrative Director of Lemeng Video.

211
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,540
Xiaoran is not here,

212
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,860
but we have Sun Xi.

213
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,260
Sun Xi is also our company's producer.

214
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,100
Greetings.

215
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,700
In terms of seniority,

216
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,460
Bi Xiaoran should call him a senior.

217
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,780
Most importantly,

218
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,900
he won't drop the ball at the crucial moment.

219
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,740
Global Picture is willing to sign the contract with Lemeng Video for two reasons.

220
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,980
On the one hand,

221
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,050
we value the influence of Lemeng Video in China.

222
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,500
On the other hand,

223
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,540
we value Miss Bi's outstanding ability.

224
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
We choose not only the Lemeng Video,

225
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,820
but also Bi Xiaoran.

can only be in her hand,

228
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,420
and we'll be at ease.

229
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,290
You can rest assured of that.

230
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,900
Lemeng will abide by the contract,

231
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,620
giving the project to Bi Xiaoran.

232
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,060
We can sign the contract first,

233
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,170
and move the project forward as soon as possible.

234
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,820
Miss Bi is not available today.

235
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,580
Maybe we should take a rain check.

236
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,180
Finish it today!

237
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,220
Lemeng isn't the only company taking eyes on Global Picture.

238
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,980
Let Sun Xi replace Bi Xiaoran first.

239
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,300

I thought you weren't coming today.

242
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,260
I apologize, it's my bad.

243
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,410
I was held up on my way.

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,100

254
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,220
Mr. Lai, I have something else to do,

255
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,140
I'll leave now.

256
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,340

257
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,700
My sister was hit like this

258
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,980
because of me.

259
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,020
And before she passed out,

260
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,420
she kept murmuring about the contract.

261
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,610
She put so much effort on this project.

262
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,140
It can't be in vain because of me.

263
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,180
So we came up with this plan,

264
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,380
I pretended to be her and signed the contract.

265
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,260
Under the circumstances,

266
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,620
that was indeed the best way to solve the problem.

267
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,980
Right, don't blame yourself too much.

268
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,850

269
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,660
that Sister Xiaoran is out of danger now.

270
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,300
But...

271
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,340
when will she wake up?

272
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,540
It depends on Xiaoran's own situation.

273
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,580
It might take two days

274
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,020
or even longer.

275
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,820

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,930

277
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,340
The license plate was fully covered.

278
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,020
I didn't see anything.

279
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,460
Besides the hit-and-run driver was also wearing a helmet,

280
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,020
and there was no CCTV on that road.

281
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,740

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,420

283
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,740
to help the officer investigate this case.

284
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,340
Okay.

285
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,330
We must investigate the case.

289
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,780

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,700
You are the perfect choice.

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,610
No, no.

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,820
I can just played once.

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,780
If this became a long-term strategy,

301
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,540
I will definitely be exposed!

302
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,980
Don't worry about this.

303
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,820
I will help you

304
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,020
about work-related matters.

305
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,380
Bi Xiaoran worked on The Journey of the Youth

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,380
for three years.

307
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,580
I don't want her to see

308
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,420
everything she did was all in vain

309
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,660
once she wakes up.

310
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,100
What do you want to ask?

311
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,540
My sister and I have never

312
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,500
been seen in public.

313
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Other than my family,

314
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,540
usually no one knows that

315
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,660
she has a twin sister.

316
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,260
How did you know about this?

317
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,860
Your sister mentioned about it once.

318
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,740
That's right.

Your sister didn't tell you about this?

327

Never!

328
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,380
Bi Xiaoran was doing a great job

329
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,780
of keeping secrets.

330
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,860

I'm really sorry.

339
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,770
I'm so sorry.

348
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
is under everyone's watch.

349
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,260
You must be aware of this.

350
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,460
I understand.

351
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,420
I need to be mean and more aggressive.

352
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,060
Am I right?

353
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,380
Come over here.

354
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,780

Sun Xue.

359
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,580
They'll spend a lot of time with you in the future.

360
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,260
You need to remember them as soon as possible.

361
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,140
Don't worry.

362
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,260
I'm very good at remembering people's faces.

363
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,340
No mistakes.

364
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,120
Mr. Lai, Sister Xiaoran.

365

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,020
Ren Qingyan?

376
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,730
Alright, I got it.

377
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,900
You go back to work.

378
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,770
Is she the famous Ren Qingyan?

379
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,610
I'm her fan!

380
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,780
Can you let me see her in person?

381
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,300
Just let me take a look at her,

382
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,460
just for one glance!

383
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,780
Jiang Lili.

384
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,780
I won't speak anymore.

385
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,120
Since you want to see her,

386
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,740
then you'll talk to her yourself.

387
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:03,540
I...

388
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,660
What should I talk about?

389
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,740
Ren Qingyan came to our company is for

390
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,069
getting the female lead of The Journey of the Youth.

391
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,540
You should deal with her.

392
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,700
Okay.

393
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,859
I'll go.

394
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,430
It's on me.

395
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,060
I have the character.

396
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,020
They'll start shooting next week.

397
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Why isn't this contract ready yet?

398
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,609
I'll do my best.

399
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,450
How do you guys doing your jobs?

400
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,220
Hello, sister Xiaoran.

401
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,460
What a bad luck.

402
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I ran into a copycat

403
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
early in this morning.

404
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,780
This scene comes once a month.

405
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,060
Last month they dressed the same

406
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,140
and sister Xiaoran forced

407
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,220
Ren Qingyan to change her clothes.

408
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,700
And the month before that,

409
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,900
Sister Xiaoran poured a cup of coffee on her

410
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,940
and ruined that cloth.

411
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,180
What will happen this month?

412
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,340
The light of candle cannot be compete with the light of the moon.

413
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,490
This cloth is made exclusively for you.

414
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,180
I don't deserve to wear this.

415
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,380
She can't be crazy, right?

416
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,220
I don't think it's that simple.

417
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,640
I bet she's making a big scene.

418
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,180
I'm looking for Zhengyi.

419
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,940
Where is he?

420
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,500
Mr. Lai is busy now.

421
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,580
If there's anything, you can ask me.

422
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,930
This project of The Journey of the Youth has been opened.

423
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,060
Every marketing account has listed

424
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,460
all the possible actress candidates.

425
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,610
I don't know if our company

426
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,900
has a specific list of candidates.

427
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,010
We haven't made a specific list,

428
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,900
but there was a list indeed, it has...

429
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,260
Speak carefully, Miss Bi.

430

Otherwise, you will have to bear all the consequences.

Sorry.

435

It's fine.

My father is the shareholder of Lemeng.

437
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,500
Do I seem like an outsider to you?

438
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,820
Mr. Ren is

439
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,100

Speak and act cautiously!

It's fine.

It's your first time to be the producer.

Mistakes are bound to happen.

454

Just don't do it next time.

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,220

For signing the contract with Global Picture.

464
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,580
Thank you.

Come.

Zhengyi,

470
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,100
we should make the cast of The Journey of the Youth.

471
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,860
My daughter Qingyan is currently available.

472
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,390
She can play a role on the project.

473
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,720
That's right.

474
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,400
Qingyan is a member of our company,

475
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,110
there is no one better than her.

476
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,030
Now that Qingyan has always been played the female lead in recent shows.

What kind of celebration dinner is this?

478

to ask for a role.

480
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,040
It's not easy for us to have a dinner together and relax.

481
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,640
It's so frustrating if we talk about works.

482
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,630

Everyone knows that you're a heavyweight drinker.

Come on.

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,440
Jiang Lili.

563
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,990
You have to restrain yourself.

564
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,120
Let me take a look!

565
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,960
Don't... don't touch my book.

566
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,070
Zhengyi.

567
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,400
We've printed the photos.

568
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,550
Tomorrow we should post these photos online.

569
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,320
Put these photos on the trend for an entire day.

570
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,790
The banquet tonight is a private event.

571
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,190
How did this Li Tianyou

572
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,160
get there?

573
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,680
I heard that he wants to see Bi Xiaoran for a long time.

574
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,400
I did him a favor

575
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,630
out of kindness.

576
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,430
I don't know if I should ask.

577
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,840
What are you

578
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,910
doing all this for?

579
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,870
You've never been in a relationship.

580
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,680
You know nothing about it.

581
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,480
You...

582
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,470
I'll leave now.

583
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,110
Play by yourself.

584
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,320

587
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,840
Hello.

588
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,120
Lili, there was an accident.

589
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Get online quickly!

590
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,190
Wait a moment.

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,480
The woman cheats on the man

593
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,590
and the man comes out of the closet.

[was photographed having dinner at a restaurant with the new generation of actor, Li Tianyou.]

597
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,230
This...

598
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,980
Isn't this the Li Tianyou as yesterday?

599
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,430
Mr. Lai.

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,800
[The woman cheats and the man comes out of the closet]

601
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,880
Lately, the celebrity boss Lai Zhengyi

602
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,230
and his assistant Xiao He have been photographed

603
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,600
kissing in the car by a passerby.

604
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,390
It can't be.

605
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,670
Morning, good morning.

606
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
I think I'm not late.

607
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,630
The reporters didn't give you a hard time, I supposed?

608
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,440
No, no...

609
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
I came through the back door.

610
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,320
There was no reporters.

611
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,880
How can you be laughing?

612
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,400
At first we made you a couple

613
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,280
is for catching eyes for the company.

614
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
Well, let's see.

615
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,350
Now, you two are giving the company a bad name.

616
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,630
Th-the bad

617
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,360
influence is

618
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,110
so strong

619
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,630
that our stocks are dr-dro...

620
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,670
dropping! -The stocks are dropping!

621
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,680
That's right, they are dropping!

622
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,560
You two represent our company.

623
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,750
Even if each of you have your own private life,

624
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,790
you should take care.

625
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,630
Now you made a scene like this.

626
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,840
It's not good for everyone.

627
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,510
No...

628
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,790
It's not like that.

629
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,000
There was a misunderstanding between Li Tianyou and I.

630
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,710
We can come forward

631
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,840
and clarify ourselves.

632
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,270
Is this your first day in the entertainment industry?

633
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,920
Do you think clarifying yourself is gonna work?

634
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,110
It will only make it worse.

635
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,150
Ex-explain...

636
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,160
Mr. Chen, you're being too kind.

637
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
You are my senior.

638
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,510
You don't have to call me sister.

639
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,560
Ex-explaination is a... co-cover up!

640
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,240
And a cover up is the tr-truth!

641
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,870
Do you understand?

642
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,790
I have an idea.

643
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,800
Let's take down this trend first,

644
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,080
and put some other trends to cover it up.

645
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,990
But by doing so

646
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,310
is equal to acquiescing in such a thing.

647
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,070
How about this?

648
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,030
Let us live together.

649
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,430
What?

650
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,830
Mr. Lai, think carefully.

651
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,070
All we can do now

652
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,680
is to play it by ear.

653
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,070
No.

654
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,950
What do you think?

655
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,280
What a smart move, Mr. Lai.

656
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,070
I hope those negative influences can be eliminated.

657
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
It's not appropriate.

658
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,270
Very nice.

659
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,430
It's a deal.

660
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,710
Can't... can't...

661
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,430
Mr. Chen has something to say.

662
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,310
You also think it's inappropriate, right?

663
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,720
Let's find another way.

664
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,070
Can't be better.

665
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,400
Do you think so?

666
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,720
Right.

667
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,630
Yes.

668
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,870
Leak the information of us living together.

669
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,390
The more people who know, the better.

670
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,550
So you are doing all of this

671
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,880
to abduct this girl

672
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,800
home with you?

673
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,840
This is not an abduction.

674
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,990
I was forced to do so.

675
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,670
Huh.

676
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,630
My pen.

677
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,400
In ancient times, Hua Mulan joined the army in place of her father.

678
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,830
Nowadays, the twin sister has to live with someone for her sister.

679
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,360
What kind of world is this?

680
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,310
Think of it as living in a dorm?

681
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,870
A dormitory?

682
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,040
There is no co-ed dormitory.

683
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,910
Sister.

684
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,040
I used think you were God's favorite one,

685
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,390
or Goddess Nuwa's favorite.

686
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,720
You have a large fan base,

687
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,070
getting both fame and fortune.

688
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,590
But now I realized,

689
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,110
it's not an easy task to be Bi Xiaoran.

690
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,520
It's so difficult!

691
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,150
I've only been here for a few days,

692
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:08,950
now I'm going to

693
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,350
living with someone else.

694
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,120
Sister,

695
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,230
you became like this because of me.

696
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,990
But I don't even have the courage to take the risk for you.

697
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Jiang Lili,

698
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,480
what a coward!

699
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,640
Sister, don't worry.

700
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,830
You've worked so hard to get what you got,

701
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,630
and I will do my best to keep it for you.

702
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,070
It's just living with someone else.

703
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,200
It's not a big deal.

704
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,320
Mr. Lai, I'm coming.

705
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,710
You got this through.

706
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,520
For my sister,

707
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,560
I will do anything.

708
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,880
Smile for me.

709
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,830
Smile?

710
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,630
That's a good angle.

711
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,110
Come on, take a few more photos.

712
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,120
Staged photography, I understand.

713
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,230
Hurry up! Quickly, quickly!

714
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,870
Ah?

715
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,320
This acting is so authentic.

716
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,350
Fine, fine.

717
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,120
Then I'll make a sacrifice.

718
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,590
Wow, big news!

719
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,160
I get it.

720
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,230
I understand.

721
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,750
What are you doing?

722
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,630
I'm talking about you.

723
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,470
Your hair stuck to your face.

724
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,550
Huh?

725
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,710
Jiang Lili.

726
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,390
You are so dirty and stupid.

727
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,270
Suit yourself.

728
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,240
Make yourself at home.

729
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,440
If I have a house

730
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,920
like this someday,

731
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,430
I can wake up laughing.

732
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,990
This could be your house,

733
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,600
if you want.

734
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,110
I don't mind having one more person on my household register.

735
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,230
What? Household register?

736
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,240
I was joking.

737
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,320
Don't be nervous.

738
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,870
From now on, let's get along as friends.

739
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,950
Your room is on the second floor.

740
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,560
My room is on the third floor.

741
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,840
We don't interfere with each other.

742
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,430
If you really mind,

743
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,520
then I'll try to limit

744
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,670
my public activities in the future.

745
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,470
No, no, no.

746
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't mind.

747
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,230
This is your house.

748
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,710
