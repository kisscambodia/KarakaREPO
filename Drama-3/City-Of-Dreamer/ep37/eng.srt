3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,199
Start with this.

4
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,700
(February 28, Ping'an Street No. 12,
Tengchong)

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,200
(February 26, Dali)

6
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,825
Look.

7
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,725
(The plantation war in the South
was escalated.)

8
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:36,869
Mr. Jiashang,

9
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:38,225
news came from the South.

10
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,520
Zhao Hua'an's plantation

11
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,050
was nearly all burned

12
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,130
during several infightings
of shareholders.

13
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,150
(During infightings of shareholders,)

14
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,231
(the opium was nearly all destroyed.)
The stored opium

15
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,350
was burned or snatched

16
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,630
during the transportation.

17
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,479
Little has been left.

18
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,191
What about Zhao Hua'an?

19
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:57,600
He was slightly wounded.

20
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,475
He's on his way back to Shanghai.

21
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Mr. Jiashang,

22
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:09,125
things are going the way

23
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,004
we've been expecting.

24
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,575
Do you still find

25
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,890
anything fishy?

26
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,399
Infightings among stockholders

27
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,600
wouldn't have struck Zhao Hua'an
so much.

28
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,144
The ruin of his plantation

29
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,884
didn't surprise me.

30
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
But Zhao Hua'an

31
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,760
has his own transportation codes.

32
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,000
And he's always cautious
with the transport.

33
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,920
But according to recent telegraphs,

34
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:33,675
all his cargos were intercepted
during transport

35
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,025
and he has lost a lot.

36
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,831
A few times can be coincidences.

37
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,134
But his cargos were intercepted
every time.

38
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,075
I'm afraid someone deciphered

39
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,519
Zhao Hua'an's transportation codes.

40
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,839
Are you saying

41
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,200
besides us,
Free at Kisskh.me

42
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,675
someone else is dealing

43
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:48,650
with Zhao Hua'an secretly?

44
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,000
Now that someone is helping,

45
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:56,679
let's speed up.

46
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,170
Go search our teahouses in Shanghai

47
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:01,105
for all the stored opium.

48
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll destroy them together.

49
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,000
Mm.

50
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,079
Any news in the company lately?

51
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,711
House prices in Wenchunli
have been picking up.

52
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,950
After the advertisement,

53
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,279
most of the flats and houses
have been sold.

54
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,439
We've got the funds back.

55
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:29,504
But Zhao Hua'an...

56
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Since he took over those companies,

57
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,380
he has been in much trouble.

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,650
I'm afraid he's now attacked
from all sides

59
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,925
and driven into a corner.

60
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,741
He must be finding helpers desperately.

61
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,140
I thought you would curse me angrily

62
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,969
after you heard about it

63
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,271
and smash as many things as you could.

64
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,975
You're in charge of the family.

65
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,854
I can't restrain you.

66
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,160
Losing my temper

67
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,050
will only be a waste of energy.

68
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,535
I contacted the American doctor for you.

69
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,530
After checking your medical record,

70
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,466
he asked when you would go
to America for the check-up.

71
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:14,836
He said you might recover

72
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:16,000
after having the operations.

73
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,250
When will you send me there?

74
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:22,584
Fanghua and Yunchi
will soon get married.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,440
I'm going to hold
a beautiful wedding for them.

76
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,759
After everything is settled,

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
I'll send you to America personally.

78
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
Father,

79
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,225
take a good rest.

80
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,050
Ungrateful son.

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,550
Zhao Hua'an is taking action again.

82
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:08,415
He's quite responsive.

83
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,625
Who does he rely on this time?

84
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:13,006
A Japanese man.

85
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:15,040
Hashimoto Shozo?

86
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:15,800
Mm.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,959
I don't know
how they get into cooperation.

88
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,114
They plan

89
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,200
to jointly open
an import and export company,

90
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,625
for only one purpose.

91
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,980
They'll sell Japanese munitions.

92
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,610
Looks like Zhao Hua'an

93
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,030
really has no way out.

94
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,075
He even wants
to cooperate with a Japanese.

95
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:34,920
By the way,

96
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,630
they'll hold an opening party.

97
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:40,936
Would you like to go?

98
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,350
(You're invited to the opening party
of Mr. Zhao Hua'an and Hashimoto Shozo.)

99
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,659
I'd like to go, of course.

100
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,625
(Invitation)

101
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,500
(Zhao Hua'an)

102
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,550
Hope we'll have a nice cooperation.

103
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,375
I hope so, too.

104
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,750
- Mr. Zhao, look this way.
- Gentlemen, look at the camera.

105
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,920
- Look at the camera, please.
- Look this way.

106
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,675
Mr. Hashimoto,

107
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:15,925
look this way, please.

108
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:16,720
All right. Thank you.

109
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:19,440
Thank you.
Free at Kisskh.me

110
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,399
I'll take my leave.

111
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:20,998
All right.

112
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,559
Thank you for coming.

113
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,519
Mr. Zhao.

114
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:36,700
Miss Feng.

115
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,039
Mr. Zhao, you look fine.

116
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:40,694
I heard

117
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,211
a lot of things happened

118
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,559
in Yunnan a while ago.

119
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,219
You not only

120
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,650
got away from the trouble,

121
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,936
but also ran the new company
with Mr. Hashimoto.

122
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:52,400
Looks like

123
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,566
your work for Qin Shuigen was

124
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,989
unworthy of your talents.

125
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,740
What on earth do you want?

126
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,119
Later I got to know

127
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,925
that it was indeed Qin Shuigen

128
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,590
who killed my mother.

129
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,825
But it was you

130
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,654
who hunted me down.

131
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
I've been thinking

132
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,505
about what I should do

133
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,850
to repay you

134
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,525
for hurting me that year.

135
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,150
What does that mean?

136
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,615
What exactly does that mean?

137
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,741
When shall we take action?

138
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:40,740
Hashimoto Shozo

139
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,899
gave him a batch
of refined Japanese rifles.

140
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,160
They'll be arriving
at the port by tomorrow noon.

141
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,825
Zhao Hua'an plans

142
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,150
to deliver them
to the southwest personally.

143
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:53,675
It's the best time to take action
by midnight tomorrow.

00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:53,025
I've verified the rifles and accounts.

175

Nothing's wrong.

176
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,975
Have more men

177
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,119
watch over the munitions.

178
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,119
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

179
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,725
Mr. Meng,

180
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,250
the prey is in place.

181
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:16,700
Why did someone telegraph

182
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,180
in the middle of the night?

183
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,775
Sir,
Free at Kisskh.me

184
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:20,300
we're asked to transfer the cargo

185
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,675
for some emergency.

186
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,516
Transfer the cargo?

187
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:23,159
Yes.

188
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,750
Why must such an important cargo

189
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,958
be transferred
in the middle of the night?

190
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,425
I... I don't know.

191
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,799
Transfer the cargo to Sunrise at Kunshan

192
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,400
at No. 4 Terminal in no time.

193
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,105
Where are you?

194
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,850
Are you transferring the cargo already?

195
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,039
Butler Zhao,

196
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,119
I want to talk to Mr. Zhao.

197
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
We received a telegraph at the terminal,

198
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,119
asking us to...

199
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,119
To transfer the cargo, right?

200
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,800
Why do you bother to call?

201
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Transfer the cargoes immediately.

202
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:27,960
You know what?

203
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,041
Mr. Zhao was assassinated.

204
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,475
Before he fell in a coma,
he asked his men to telegraph you

205
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:32,719
so that you would transfer the cargo.

206
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:33,900
What are you waiting for?

207
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,119
Go check

208
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,640
if the ambulance has come!

209
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,000
Is... Is Mr. Zhao all right?

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,950
Shall I go help him with my men?

211
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,239
Just watch over the cargo.

212
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,800
That's how you fulfill your duty.

213
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,320
What's wrong?

214
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:56,636
What are you waiting for?

215
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,395
Go transfer the cargo to No. 4 Terminal!

216
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,350
- Hurry!
- All right.

217
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,719
I think

218
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,640
they believed it.

219
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:13,675
Come and help me.

220
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:14,600
- Come on.
- Be gentle.

221
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,000
Be careful.

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,841
Watch your steps.

223
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,919
All right.

224
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,325
Here. Put them down.

225
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,159
Mr. Zhao was hurt.

226
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,405
I know.

227
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Discharge the cargo quickly.

228
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,399
I'm in a hurry to check on him.

229
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,300
Come on.

230
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,225
You do know how to fawn on him.

231
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,119
Speed up!

232
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:39,760
Be quick!

233
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,100
Hurry. Hurry.

234
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,479
They're transferring the cargo.

235
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,856
Time to take the next step.

236
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,690
Open the door!

237
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,050
What?

238
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:41,655
Mr. Zhao,

239
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,111
weren't you assassinated?

240
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,909
Why did you come?

241
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:47,510
Shouldn't you be watching
over the cargo?

242
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,325
We heard you were assassinated

243
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,599
and we transferred the cargoes
to somewhere safe

244
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:52,100
as you told us.

245
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,859
When was I assassinated?

246
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,660
Who asked you to transfer the cargo?

247
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,780
Where did you move them?

248
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
You telegraphed us,

249
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,750
asking us to transfer the cargo
to Sunrise at Kunshan

250
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,029
at No. 4 Terminal.

251
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:02,909
On that ship,

252
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,925
I saw Li Sanbao and his men.

253
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,000
They also knew you were assassinated.

254
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,325
Look.

255
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,825
Here's the telegraph.

256
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:10,975
Nonsense!

257
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:14,460
I didn't telegraph you at all!

258
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,604
Because of a fake telegraph,

259
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:18,975
you transferred the cargo!

260
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,475
Li Sanbao is

261
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,265
greedy and careless.

262
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,726
When have I ever trusted him?

263
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,564
Why would I ask him
to receive the cargoes?

264
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,300
Are you out of your mind?

265
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:32,625
Spare me, Mr. Zhao.

266
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,466
I indeed received a code telegraph.

267
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,025
I even called you.

268
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:36,946
Your butler said

269
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:38,186
you were assassinated

270
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,347
and you telegraphed us
to transfer the cargo.

271
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,450
Don't be deceived, Master.

272
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,865
After 11:00 PM,

273
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,260
the residence was locked.

274
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,875
Then I stayed in the annex building.

275
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,396
I couldn't come back
to answer the phone.

276
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:53,115
Besides, there's an extension
in your room.

277
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,316
If the telephone had rung,

278
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,125
you would hear it.

279
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,560
Get the cargo back.

280
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,009
You must get it back today.

281
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,671
Otherwise,

282
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,686
I'll throw all your family

283
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,700
into Huangpu River.

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,760
Get out!

285
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

286
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,131
Go. Hurry!

287
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:23,520
- Go, go, go.
- Hurry. Hurry.

288
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,500
(No Candle Flame)

289
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,580
Mr. Zhao!

290
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:34,904
Mr. Zhao!

291
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,359
Get up.

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,599
Get up.

293
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,051
Mr. Zhao!

294
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,025
I saw someone loading the cargo
at No. 6 Terminal!

295
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:45,895
(Warehouse)
I heard that some boxes there

296
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:47,275
looked like ours.

297
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,425
Go get your men in the car!

298
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:51,475
Buddies!

299
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,375
Buddies!

300
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:57,316
Buddies, get your weapons. Go!

301
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:58,294
Go!

302
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,307
- Go.
- Go.

303
00:18:59,307 --> 00:18:59,975
Go.

304
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,075
Hurry!

305
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,025
Don't let them run away.

306
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,239
If you take back the cargo,

307
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,479
you'll get a hundred
silver dollars each!

308
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,280
If you die, we'll raise your family!

309
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
Go!

310
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

311
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,345
Buddies,

312
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,275
go!

313
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,079
How dare you rob Mr. Zhao?

314
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,599
You're bold.

315
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,920
Don't you know

316
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,800
who Mr. Zhao Hua'an is?

317
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,325
Keep them under guard.

318
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,475
- Yes.
- Yes.

319
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,000
Mr. Zhao,

320
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,185
are these our rifles?

321
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:07,425
They look like

322
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,550
American rifles.

323
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,365
Something's wrong, Mr. Zhao.

324
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:15,168
We have Japanese rifles.

325
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:16,600
They're not ours.

326
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:29,625
Oh, no.

327
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,350
We've been set up.

328
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,280
Mr. Zhao,

329
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,970
these rifles are more expensive

330
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,100
than ours.

331
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,500
If you think they're dangerous,

332
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,625
we can sell them

333
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,505
in batches.

334
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,125
There are no codes on the boxes, either.

335
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,079
Shut up!

336
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,400
Get off the ship immediately!

337
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,160
Hurry!

338
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,990
It's the surprise
I prepared for Zhao Hua'an.

339
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,271
How do you like it?

340
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,339
This is the price
he has to pay for his crimes.

341
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,600
At last,

342
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,910
this case

343
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,800
has come to an end.

344
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,304
I'm showing enough mercy.

345
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:31,986
If I were as heartless as before,

346
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,346
I would just shoot him to death.

347
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:34,450
All would be finished, then.

348
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:36,495
Being killed won't make him suffer.

349
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,166
But he'll be tortured more
if he's alive.

350
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,075
Qin Shuigen is now disabled.

351
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,850
He's living a hell-like life.

352
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,950
Isn't it exactly what you want?

353
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,290
Zhao Hua'an will also know

354
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,025
how it feels to have lost everything.

355
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,400
Now I understand.

356
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,100
You're suggesting

357
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,800
that I shouldn't offend you, right?

358
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:11,500
Wait. Wait.

359
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,291
Who are you?

360
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,800
This is Mr. Zhao's residence.

361
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:16,750
Somebody!

362
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,275
Call the police,

363
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,825
and say someone wants to rob us.

364
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,075
We came for Mr. Zhao.

365
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,719
Four hours ago,

366
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,038
he blew up the munitions
of the government army.

367
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,319
We came to catch him
and confiscate his property.

368
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,119
Do it!

369
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:31,959
- Yes!
- Yes!

370
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,640
What are you doing?

371
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,439
How lawless you are!

372
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:36,050
What are you doing?

373
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,099
What on earth are you doing?

374
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,488
- Quickly.
- Put these things

375
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:41,575
into the car.

376
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,675
You can't take them away!

377
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:46,356
Be quick.

378
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:47,875
What are you doing?

379
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,470
How can you do this?

380
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,230
Stop.

381
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,844
Aren't you robbing in broad daylight?

382
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:55,765
Stop talking nonsense!

383
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,500
Your boss broke the law.

384
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,079
He blew up the munitions
worth a million.

385
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,350
What? No way.

386
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,590
His residence and lands

387
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,750
(March 1, the 16th year of the Republic of China)
have been confiscated.

388
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,525
If he comes back to you,

389
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,159
you must report it to the police!

390
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,494
He's the primary criminal.

391
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:14,766
You'll get hugely rewarded
if he's caught!

392
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,915
You sealed the house.

393
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,474
Where shall we live, then?

394
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:24,300
Yeah.

395
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:25,875
You...

396
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,625
- How lawless...
- What bad luck do we have!

397
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,075
...you are!

398
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,119
Let's go over there.

399
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,775
Mr. Meng guessed right.

400
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,920
When Zhao Hua'an is desperate,

401
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:32,375
he'll indeed ask Mrs. Rong for help.

402
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,575
It doesn't take
much imagination to guess.

403
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,719
To Zhao Hua'an,

404
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,489
Mrs. Rong must be
his last straw to clutch at.

405
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:41,925
Let's go.

406
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,530
There was a leakage

407
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,650
in the warlords' ship with munitions.

408
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,625
The munitions were transferred
to another ship temporarily.

409
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,711
But you blew them up.

410
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,959
If the warlords know that,

411
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,875
how will they punish the man

412
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,975
who dared to blow up their munitions?

413
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:16,375
We've arranged this for you.

414
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:18,705
Do you like it?

415
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,680
I should have figured it out.

416
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:25,844
Looks like

417
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,525
you still remember

418
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,100
what you did.

419
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,719
Miss Feng,

420
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,076
I did it

421
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,460
because I...

422
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,299
I was deceived.

423
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:46,816
Qin Shuigen tricked me.

424
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,925
I shouldn't have killed your family

425
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:53,616
with him.

426
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:55,215
I feel terribly guilty.

427
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,121
Miss Feng, please...

428
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:01,719
No.

429
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:03,594
Miss Rong,

430
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,600
give me a chance

431
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,870
to make it up for you.

432
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:09,280
Make it up for me?

433
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,450
Mm.

434
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,610
How will you make it up for me?

435
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,199
My family property was confiscated.

436
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,195
But I have some shares and bonds.

437
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,820
I'll give them all to you.

438
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,400
Besides,

439
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
in Shanghai,

440
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,125
I have three teahouses for opium.

441
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,470
I'll give you the best and biggest one.

442
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:37,356
This is how you'll make it up for me?

443
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:38,199
There's more.

444
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:41,450
I can

445
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,941
kill Qin Shuigen for you.

446
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:50,515
Kill Qin Shuigen for me?

447
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,639
But I wish

448
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:58,975
he could live.

449
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,020
He's now disabled

450
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,209
without dignity.
Free at Kisskh.me

451
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,431
Imprisoned and disdained by his family,

452
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:09,315
he's been tortured
by ghosts and loneliness

453
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:12,105
day after day.

454
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,351
Isn't it more interesting
than killing him?

455
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:18,119
What do you want, then?

456
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:18,719
Tell me.

457
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:20,675
I'll do anything for you.

458
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,390
Do you want to expose his crimes?

459
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:24,455
I can be your witness.

460
00:29:24,455 --> 00:29:26,075
I can accuse him in court.

461
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,541
What on earth do you want?

462
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:37,686
Tell me!

463
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,350
What do you want?

464
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,650
What exactly do you want?

465
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:46,486
My family

466
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,325
(Tablet of a young man)
were all infected with pestis.

467
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:49,075
(Tablet of Father Qian Bingtian)

468
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:51,555
Let go of how they were infected.

469
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,450
It was

470
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,850
a serious disease.

471
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:59,000
But if they had
taken medicine regularly,

472
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,880
they had the hope to be cured.

473
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,294
However...

474
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,781
You and Qin Shuigen

475
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:09,621
blocked the gate
of our residence for five days,

476
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:11,925
providing them nothing to eat or drink!

477
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:14,525
You watched them
die of hunger and disease!

478
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:17,825
So today,

479
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,199
shouldn't you atone for that?

480
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:23,839
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,475
I'm really sorry.

482
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:27,079
I beg you. I beg you.

483
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,375
You don't deserve to beg me.

484
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:30,959
Did my family

485
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,125
also beg you and Qin Shuigen like this,

486
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,471
for some food and water?

487
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:36,671
But what did you do?

488
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,650
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

489
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,479
Don't. Don't!

490
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,319
Your younger brother is still alive.

491
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,080
He's alive!

492
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,335
What did you say?

493
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:57,034
Your brother is alive.

494
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,400
How can you prove it?

495
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:03,350
That year,

496
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:05,934
Qin Shuigen asked me
to kill your brother.

497
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,760
My wife gave birth to a son
at that time.

498
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,150
Your brother reminded me of my own son.

499
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,525
I didn't want to kill him, then.

500
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,050
I lied to Qin Shuigen

501
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,800
that your brother was frozen to death

502
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,425
in the wild.

503
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,275
You took my brother back?

504
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,079
Let go of me

505
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,350
and I'll tell you where he is.

506
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,060
Tell me where he is

507
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,225
and I'll let you go.

508
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,139
Untie me.

509
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,199
Say it!

510
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,150
Untie me!

511
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,100
That year,

512
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:56,466
I left your brother in the countryside.

513
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,190
An old widow raised him.

514
00:31:58,475 --> 00:32:00,834
Later, she took him

515
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:03,895
to the plantation in the South.

516
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:05,545
A couple of years ago,

517
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,859
she was badly sick.

518
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:10,515
To make money for her treatment,

519
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,591
your bother came to Shanghai.

520
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:14,216
I had him spied on.

521
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:16,400
But he ran away accidentally.

522
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,524
How can you prove

523
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:19,263
that he is my brother?

524
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,180
That boy

525
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,319
has a longevity lock.

526
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,160
It's made of silver.

527
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,040
It has the word "Zhen"
on the front side

528
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,350
and a birth date on the back side.

529
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:30,280
But it doesn't look

530
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,119
like his birth date.

531
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,119
It looks like yours.

532
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,671
When you find the longevity lock,

533
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:36,125
you find your brother.

534
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,206
I found it on him.

535
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,950
I don't think it's yours.

536
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,550
(Li)

537
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,975
It's your brother's.

538
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,985
Even if you're as wicked as possible,

539
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:00,650
you're still scared

540
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,350
that you'll be killed by one injection.

541
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,479
Actually, there's nothing in the tubing.

542
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,275
What does it mean?

543
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:17,000
What? What are you doing?

544
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,075
You can survive,
but you must be punished.

545
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,625
He must be punished

546
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,975
for the crimes he did.

547
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:33,959
Take him to the police station.

548
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,225
He'll get what he deserves.

549
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,839
Mr. Jiashang,

550
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,640
this is the opium

551
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,720
we have stored in Shanghai.

552
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,050
All of it.

553
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,375
Mm.

554
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,679
Opium is like a malignant tumor,

555
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,096
deeply rooted among people.

556
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,805
As long as it exists,

557
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,900
more people will get hurt.

558
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:25,375
If things go on like this,

559
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,809
the nation will be ruined.

560
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,320
I remember all that you have told me.

561
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:41,925
Today, I'm finally doing it.

562
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,650
What are you reading?

563
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,375
(Mr. Rong Jiashang destroyed the opium,
ruining his own family business.)

564
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:06,076
I didn't expect Rong Jiashang

565
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:08,746
to ruin the most profitable business
of his family for you.

566
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,024
He is

567
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,100
indeed forceful.

568
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:16,639
It's always his aim

569
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,474
to ruin the illegal business
of his family.

570
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:20,635
Even without me,

571
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,880
he would do that, too.

572
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:28,840
I know you're softhearted.

573
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:30,736
Hope you won't hold things up.

574
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,175
Qin Shuigen is

575
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,725
my deadly enemy.

576
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,950
No one will change that.

577
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,139
Master.

578
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,250
Come on in.

579
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:06,014
Master,

580
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,204
someone sent a box,

581
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:09,645
saying it was a present for you.

582
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:11,765
A present?

583
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,839
For what?

584
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:15,525
I didn't ask him.

585
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:21,675
Open it.

586
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:22,350
Yes.

587
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,145
Somebody!

588
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,175
Mr. Jiashang!

589
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:30,350
Mr. Jiashang!

590
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:31,575
What's wrong, Butler Zhang?

591
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,625
Mr. Jiashang!

592
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,160
This was sent with the box.

593
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,600
What did the deliveryman look like?

594
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,719
Just an ordinary servant.

595
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:47,425
I didn't see his face clearly.

596
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:52,985
I get it.

597
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,701
Leave us.

598
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,075
Don't let others know.

599
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:57,425
Yes, Mr. Jiashang.

600
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,100
Father.

601
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:20,040
Solve this problem

602
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,300
in no time.

603
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,875
What do you want me to do?

604
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,309
What do I want you to do?

605
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
I want you

606
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,974
to get rid of anyone
who goes against our family

607
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:35,100
and wants to kill me.

608
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,811
I want you

609
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,369
to protect our family.

610
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,475
But can you do that?

611
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,324
What's the point of saying this?

612
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,959
Now that you can't do it,

613
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:49,320
don't pretend you care about me!

614
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,720
I'm doing everything

615
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,220
to protect my family.

616
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,175
Protect your family?

617
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,636
Do you think

618
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,600
I don't know what you did out there

619
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,230
just because I can't go out?

620
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,996
Mr. Rong Jiashang destroyed the opium

621
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:08,700
and ruined his own family business.

622
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,460
It's a big scandal in the city.

623
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,901
You've totally disgraced our family!

624
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:13,639
You...

625
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,875
You useless loser!

626
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:19,250
You pissed me off.

627
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,000
You pissed me off.

628
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,399
Now that you don't listen to me,

629
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:26,200
I don't need to give you any advice.

630
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,665
If you're scared,

631
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31,879
stay in the room obediently.

632
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,071
As long as you don't leave the room,

633
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,625
I'll be able to keep you alive.

634
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,175
Father,

635
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:45,725
you're already disabled.

636
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:48,159
Rest for recuperation

637
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,090
and don't waste your time.

638
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:11,194
You think I'll wait and do nothing?

639
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,600
Fine.

640
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:17,875
Now that you've made up your mind,

641
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,269
don't blame me for being heartless.

642
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:34,439
How's it going with Shiori?

643
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,840
How was your talk
with Mr. Rong Jiashang?

644
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,550
He rejected us unmistakably.

645
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,439
He just doesn't like Shiori.

646
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,169
Mr. Jiashang is a rich young man.

647
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,770
Why would he marry
a concubine's daughter?

648
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,000
What are you talking about?

649
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,500
My concubine's daughter

650
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,320
can be as good as legitimate daughters
from other families.

651
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,495
Do you remember Colonel Matsuda?

652
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:05,575
I hear his wife has just died.

653
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:08,035
And he likes young girls.

654
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,399
Why don't we marry Shiori to him?

655
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:13,159
You'll then get a double advantage.

656
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:14,700
Matsuda is

657
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,150
nearly as old as me.

658
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:22,375
But he and his brothers
are very influential

659
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,734
in the military.

660
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,600
If we can unite them by marriage,

661
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,700
it'll do no harm but much good

662
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,725
to our family business.

663
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,150
A daughter should be married

664
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,250
for her family profits.

665
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,550
Instead of making her
Rong Jiashang's concubine,

666
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,260
why don't we make her
Matsuda's legal wife?

667
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:43,145
After that,

668
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,170
the status of our clan

669
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:48,075
will be higher in Shanghai.

670
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,159
I will

671
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:54,945
think about it.

672
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,919
