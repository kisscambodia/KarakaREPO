=City of Streamer=

2
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,640
I have one concern,

4
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,074
or scruple.

5
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,720
The man you love might get hurt.

6
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:47,695
There is no more a tie between us.

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,480
What's more,

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,199
he's a man.

9
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,706
Does a man need the shelter of a woman?

10
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,879
Most of all I want now

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,080
is to smash the evil business

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
of the Rong Family into pieces,

13
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,680
so the managers

14
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,440
will fight against
and destroy each other.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,119
When they are dreaming crazy and wild,

16
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
we'll catch them all in one net.

17
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
That's the deal, then.

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,639
We must let them pay.

19
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,856
Young Master.

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,639
Would you like some night munchies?

21
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,360
There's mutton soup
stewed in the kitchen.

22
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,700
It's tasty.

23
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,479
No.

24
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,039
I drank a lot at the dinner party.

25
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,279
I don't have the appetite.

26
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,320
Is everything okay?

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,700
Yes.

28
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,320
How is it going with
my little brother's funeral?

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,279
Ma'am is taking care of it.

30
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,000
People were sent back to
the ancestral grave to observe fengshui.

31
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,570
The coffin was ordered, too.

32
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,275
It will be delivered tomorrow.

33
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:32,775
Concubine Sun gets better now.

34
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,300
She had a walk in the courtyard today.

35
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,560
Master took out a piece of jade

36
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,320
and asked to

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,575
bury it with the youngest master.

38
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,279
I see.

39
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,185
Young Master, have a rest.

40
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,325
Father.

41
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,925
The day my little brother died,

42
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,600
you passed out.

43
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,000
The doctor said

44
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,320
your arms were paralyzed

45
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,925
because of a minor stroke.

46
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,789
Jiashang,

47
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,775
that's...

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,440
that's my

49
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
private coffer.

50
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,400
Take out 30,000 silver dollars.

51
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,119
I want to

52
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,925
marry Fanghua off with those.

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
Help me

54
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,239
to keep the rest safe.

55
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:40,265
When Fanglin gets married,

56
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,519
give those to her.

57
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,839
I won't let my daughters

58
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,959
get married miserably.

59
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,679
Where's Shujun?

60
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,160
She went to her mother's house.

61
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,760
She'll be back early tomorrow morning.

62
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,559
When she is back,

63
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,559
tell her to see me.

64
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,640
I'm tired.

65
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,760
I want to

66
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,740
have a rest.

67
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,399
The room service is quick.

68
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,079
Come in.

69
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:33,679
Jiashang.

70
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,345
Why are you here?

71
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
Uncle Zhao, I hear

72
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,375
you organize card games
at the Astor House all year round.

73
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,775
I planned to play a few rounds,

74
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,119
not expecting that
I would disturb your rest.

75
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,679
What a coincidence.

76
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,040
The game finished early today.

77
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,600
How about this?

78
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Let me get dressed.

79
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,811
Then we can go downstairs for a drink.

80
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,100
Don't bother.

81
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,160
In that case,

82
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,975
we can have a small talk.

83
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:01,950
Come in.

84
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,325
What are you doing? Hua...

85
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,520
Since my father was ill,

86
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,150
I've been busy running the business.

87
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,420
Thank you for taking care of my family.

88
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,600
But you seem to

89
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,440
care about Ma'am the most.

90
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,320
No wonder Ma'am is radiant

91
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,400
and looks years younger these days.

92
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Jiashang,

93
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,640
about that,

94
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,760
it's really my fault.

95
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,609
Shujun

96
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,950
and I made a mistake on impulse.

97
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,840
But it needn't get out,

98
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
lest the Rong Family will be disgraced.

99
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,350
Sure.

100
00:08:58,225 --> 00:08:59,650
My father is sensitive
about his reputation.

101
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
He's in bad condition

102
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,934
and my little brother has passed away.

103
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,320
He is in sorrow already.

104
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,200
If he finds out what Ma'am did,

105
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm afraid he'll break down.

106
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,789
For the sake of the family,

107
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,125
we must keep it a secret.

108
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,460
Rong Jiashang,

109
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,850
you conscienceless rascal!

110
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,800
Like father, like son.

111
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,245
First you murdered my son,

112
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,875
then you detained Master,

113
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,760
and now,

114
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,520
you're trying to threaten me?

115
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,119
You monster!

116
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,950
You monster!

117
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,200
Shortsighted woman.

118
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,000
Jiashang,

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,760
calm down.

120
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,250
We can

121
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,039
talk about everything.

122
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,640
Uncle Zhao,

123
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,479
my father told me

124
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,840
his name was Qin Shuigen.

125
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,239
To take a lottery ticket
from his sworn brother,

126
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,950
Rong Dingkun,

127
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,700
he killed the latter.

128
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,000
In the end,

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,675
fire cannot be wrapped in paper.

130
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,095
Rong Dingkun's daughter didn't die.

131
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,025
She's back.

132
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,599
I see.

133
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:20,559
Who is she?

134
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,700
She is

135
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,239
Miss Feng, your governess, isn't she?

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,799
You were the driver, weren't you?

137
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,850
Shizhen vaguely remembers you.

138
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,825
You tricked her mother
into seeing my father,

139
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,700
and killed the mother and her son

140
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,119
with my father.

141
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,875
It was really her.

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,640
Dingkun told me

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,039
the first time he saw her,

144
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,080
he broke out in a cold sweat.

145
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,520
He had never been afraid of any woman.

146
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,520
Only Miss Feng

147
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,679
made him scared.

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,475
Did she come to wreak revenge?

149
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,185
My father is always afraid of it, right?

150
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,080
That's why he set fire to Wenchunli

151
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,715
when he couldn't purchase it.

152
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,799
Once it was purchased by others,

153
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,479
the body buried in the old house

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,479
would be found.

155
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:10,500
Actually, I didn't
approve him of setting the fire.

156
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,479
He would have got into trouble
through clever means.

157
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,640
Rong Dingkun

158
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,239
was killed by your father.

159
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,400
I just helped him to hide the body.

160
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,640
That was the first time
your father murdered a man.

161
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,599
From then on,

162
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,825
he has always dreaded it

163
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,000
and never been relieved from anxiety.

164
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,050
Were you saying
it wasn't easy for my father

165
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,200
to work so hard?

166
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,799
Even though he dreaded it,

167
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,760
he still murdered
the entire Rong Family.

168
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,800
Shujun, now you know,

169
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,840
compared with the murder,

170
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,275
it was nothing that Dingkun
hooked up with Miss Meng

171
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,080
and gained the Gold Kylin

172
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,359
by cheating.

173
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,440
But, Jiashang, you should know.

174
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,440
If it weren't
for your father's ruthlessness,

175
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,025
the Rong Family would have
collapsed long ago.

176
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:03,679
You would never be
a glamorous young master.

177
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,440
Instead, you would be a clerk
of some commerce chamber,

178
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:09,080
or an apprentice of some store.

179
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,550
You should thank your father

180
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,679
for being shameless.

181
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,730
No matter how gorgeous
a blood stained robe is,

182
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,919
nobody would put it on!

183
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,080
So what?

184
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,275
He's your father after all.

185
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,725
You can't change it even if
you peel the skin off your body.

186
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,450
All your life,

187
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,520
you must carry your father's crimes.

188
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,125
Therefore,

189
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,960
instead of criticizing him,

190
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,320
you'd better think
how to clean up the mess.

191
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,850
I'll carry my father's crimes.

192
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,350
What about yours?

193
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:39,840
Uncle Zhao,

194
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,640
if the other uncles knew,

195
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,474
the goods they had lost these years

196
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:46,766
were resold by you in secret,

197
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,159
what would they think?

198
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,559
Why would they believe the rumors?

199
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,000
Now that I can bring myself
to confront you about it,

200
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,125
I surely have the evidence.

201
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,320
Since I joined the company,

202
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,640
I've found there were great loses

203
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,440
in the You Line and the Wu Line

204
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,775
in the south.

205
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,039
My father trusts you.

206
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,679
He blames it on uncertain situations.

207
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,520
But I've been looking into you.

208
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,640
I have both witnesses
and physical evidences.

209
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,025
If my father
and the other uncles knew it,

210
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,080
what do you think they would say?

211
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,825
Do you think

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,325
I'm the only one who was doing this?

213
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,475
Of course not.

214
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,679
You've been fighting for power
and profits with the other uncles.

215
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,975
It must be hard.

216
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,400
It's nothing.

217
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,280
As a young man,

218
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,700
you are not their match.

219
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
I have good advice for you.

220
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,375
I'm listening.

221
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,159
Turn the business

222
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:54,400
over to me.

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,080
What did you say?

224
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,350
You're swallowing such a big part
of our family business?

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,919
Jiashang can't suppress them.

226
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,479
Though they seem to be
at peace outwardly,

227
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,675
privately,

228
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,535
they're ready to make trouble.

229
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,559
Instead of waiting until
the old devils betray you,

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,919
you'd better turn it over to me

231
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,225
and let me run it.

232
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,500
Let's form a partnership.

233
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,965
I'll do all the work.

234
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:23,025
You'll get the dividend every year
without doing anything.

235
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,919
That's our family business.

236
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,250
Why would we turn it over to you?

237
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,250
You wish!

238
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,425
Zhao Hua'an, I was so blind.

239
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,400
You and Rong Dingkun
are two birds of a feather.

240
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,825
You're both good for nothing!

241
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:35,904
You jerk!

242
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm doing it for your own good.

243
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,350
Shujun,

244
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,559
the old devils

245
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,919
only respect you on the surface.

246
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,280
They are all murderers.

247
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,919
If they have to,

248
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,080
they won't hesitate to kill
all the Rong Family.

249
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,039
The Qin Family.

250
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,225
Technically,

251
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,315
it's the Qin Family.

252
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,025
The Rong Family
had been exterminated long ago,

253
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,159
except for Shizhen.

254
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,919
I understand

255
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,216
your point.

256
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,075
If I'm not doing the work,

257
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,159
I won't take the profits.

258
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,599
I assume you know

259
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,840
how I hate the dark business
of the Rong Family.

260
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,880
If you want it,

261
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,309
we can discuss the share transfer.

262
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,125
After all,

263
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,919
I don't want to make money from it.

264
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,675
I just want a smooth transition.

265
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,200
Jiashang,

266
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,575
what are you doing?

267
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,320
You're so disappointing.

268
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:35,719
Why do you give up our business

269
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,039
without putting up a fight?

270
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,159
What about you, Ma'am?

271
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,400
A son of your family just died,

272
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,640
and you're still in the mood
for cheating on your husband.

273
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:48,145
Did you say

274
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,125
share transfer?

275
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,175
Yes.

276
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,616
As you said,

277
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,675
we sell our shares,

278
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,450
resign from the boards of the companies,

279
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,440
and support you to be the new director.

280
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,919
We'll sell the shares to you
at a discount of 10%

281
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,025
on one condition:

282
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,800
you must pay in silver dollars.

283
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,080
30%.

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
20%.

285
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,200
If you don't agree with it,

286
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,800
I can make more money
selling them to others.

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,479
It's a deal.

288
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:24,824
When do we go through the formalities?

289
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,239
Let the lawyers meet tomorrow.

290
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,150
Good.

291
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,950
You're exceptionally vigorous.

292
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,200
Like father, like son.

293
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,119
It's getting late.

294
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,400
You should get some sleep.

295
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,575
I'll take Ma'am home.

296
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,750
Ma'am.

297
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,800
Tell me,

298
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,450
how do you like to punish me?

299
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:38,925
Uncle Zhao was right about one thing.

300
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,959
My father isn't a good husband.

301
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,550
It hasn't been easy for you these years.

302
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,325
You're my elder.

303
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,550
I have no right to punish you.

304
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,119
I told my father

305
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,625
you went to your mother's house.

306
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,520
You would go see him when he woke up.

307
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,775
My father received heavy blows recently.

308
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,520
He is depressed.

309
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,875
He couldn't think straight
and remember anything.

310
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,760
It's just,

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,425
Fanglin hasn't married yet.

312
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,520
If the word about your affair gets out,

313
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,450
how could she find a decent husband?

314
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,800
Don't you threaten me with Fanglin.

315
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:27,575
Even if we have to jump into
the Huangpu River together,

316
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,760
we won't ask for charity from you.

317
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,825
Fanglin is my younger sister.

318
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:35,719
Being kind to her

319
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:36,920
and looking after her

320
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,300
are my responsibilities.

321
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,100
Since your heart
is no longer with the family,

322
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
if you want a divorce,

323
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,294
I'll persuade my father

324
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,439
to give you freedom.

325
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,375
I won't divorce him.

326
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,560
At least,

327
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,680
not now.

328
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,481
Otherwise, how could Fanglin
find a husband?

329
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,950
Tomorrow,

330
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,700
ask the lawyer to draw up an agreement,

331
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,550
making sure she'll get all my dowry.

332
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,775
When she finds a husband,

333
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
I'll move out immediately.

334
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,925
Okay.

335
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,900
Please put up with it

336
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:18,755
for some more time, then.

337
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,224
You're not like your father.

338
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,880
I know

339
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,650
you always hate me in your mind,

340
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,900
because I asked your father
to send you to the Military Academy.

341
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,175
But now it seems that

342
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,760
if you didn't leave,

343
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,359
if you grew up in the family

344
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,045
under the influence of your father,

345
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
you would probably become
another Rong...

346
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:49,959
no,

347
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,125
I should say,

348
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,325
become another Qin Shuigen.

349
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,199
Probably.

350
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:05,895
But,

351
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,050
I don't hate you anymore.

352
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,450
You and me,

353
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,400
we'll go separate ways.

354
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,575
(Astor House)

355
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,575
(Astor House)

356
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,275
Come in.

357
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,750
Put them on the table.

358
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,400
Yes.

359
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,425
Miss Feng.

360
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:14,145
As you required,

361
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,640
I've brought you the detailed background

362
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,040
of all the secretaries
in the Rong Company.

363
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,100
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

364
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,560
I have good news.

365
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,599
Zhao Hua'an took action immediately

366
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,650
(February 19 shipping from Xileshan)
after meeting Rong Jiashang's lawyer.

367
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,732
(February 19th shipping from Xileshan)
This is the telegram I intercepted

368
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:35,119
yesterday afternoon

369
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,439
after their meeting.

370
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,000
The biggest piece of meat

371
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,160
is grabbed by Zhao Hua'an.

372
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,175
It seems that the Rong Family
will be in disorder.

373
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,640
By the way, Mr. Yang,

374
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,319
could you help me
to collect the information

375
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,199
concerning the opium business
of the Rong Family?

376
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,079
I'm on it now.

377
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,000
Thank you.

382
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:27,004
You specifically

383
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:28,895
asked me to send a reporter
to follow them.

384
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,075
Do you have any big plans?

385
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:32,150
Excuse me.

386
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,369
A steak.

387
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,275
A celery and apple juice.

388
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,300
Just a moment.

389
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,920
The news caused

390
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,450
a great stir in the company.

391
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,199
All the qualified shareholders

392
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,400
are eager to have a try.

393
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,920
They either insinuate that
they'll make me better offers,

394
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,636
or try to sabotage
Zhao's acquisition of the shares.

395
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,640
It's completely unknown

396
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,700
who will get the business

397
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,040
before the contract

398
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,359
is finally signed.

399
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,560
You want the shareholders to
struggle for power

400
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,119
in order to weaken their strength.

401
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,650
In the end, you'll reap the benefits?

402
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:10,346
Yunchi,

403
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:12,425
some of my family business

404
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,175
is too dirty.

405
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,640
I've always detested it.

406
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:20,079
Honestly,

407
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,119
I don't want anyone

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,599
to take those parts of the business.

409
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,040
You're not going to...

410
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,079
I'm going to
wait until both sides suffer

411
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,520
before I step in

412
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,920
and destroy all of the gray business

413
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,850
of my family,

414
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,040
especially the opium business.

415
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:40,000
Here is your steak.

416
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:41,826
Please enjoy.

417
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,649
Thanks.

418
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,575
Have you made the decision?

419
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,020
If you do that,

420
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
the Rong Family will fall apart.

421
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,040
Even if you hate your father

422
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,680
and the dirty business,

423
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:59,050
you should think of your sisters.

424
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,119
Without the family behind them,

425
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:03,065
their life would be harder.

426
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,230
Yunchi,

427
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:08,719
take care of Fanghua for me.

428
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,119
Don't worry.

429
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,560
I've got her dowry ready early.

430
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:14,680
As for Fanglin,

431
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,300
I plan to send her abroad to study.

432
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,525
What about you?

433
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,479
Your father and Zhao Hua'an
have common opinions.

434
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,640
If he regains the control of the family,

435
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,719
will he still treat you

436
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,950
as his successor?

437
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,640
If you're driven out of his house,

438
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:33,650
you'll be deprived

439
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,199
of everything.

440
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,719
At that time,

441
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,909
will Miss Feng still want you?

442
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,920
If you want my opinion,

443
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,610
women need

444
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,875
material comforts for nourishment.

445
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,599
Even if she wants you,

446
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,425
do you have the heart to see her
living a hard life with you?

447
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,880
I'm not used to the vegetable juice.

448
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,675
It's too bitter.

449
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,839
There's honey in it.

450
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,150
Still, it's bitter.

451
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,950
Father.

452
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:34,700
(Study)

453
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,444
Father, I wonder if you

454
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:41,375
(Zhao Hua'an Breaks with the Rongs)
have heard about the Rong Family.

455
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,300
I feel sorry for Jiashang.

456
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,400
He has no elders to support him

457
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,075
and no relatives to help him.

458
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,040
You said you went out

459
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,119
with Rong Jiashang in Chongqing.

460
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,400
Do you think

461
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,079
he still has feelings for you?

462
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,150
I'm still

463
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,199
in love with him.

464
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,625
As for him,

465
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,150
(Zhao Hua'an Breaks with the Rongs)
in such a dazzling world of Shanghai,

466
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,800
(Share Transfer Contract to Be Signed)
he may have changed his heart.

467
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,025
But I fell in love with him

468
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:14,224
when he was poor and low.

469
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,290
I'm different from those women
who come for

470
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,325
his fame and wealth.

471
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:26,040
(Study)

472
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,880
Call the Rong Company

473
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,400
and invite Mr. Jiashang over
for a cup of tea.

474
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,325
Help yourself.

475
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,126
Thank you.

476
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,439
Mr. Hashimoto, what can I

477
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,680
do for you?

478
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,520
I hear you're

479
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,025
in a difficult situation.

480
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,511
Shiori is very worried about you.

481
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,359
Those uncles of yours,

482
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,479
I've heard of them for a long time.

483
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,880
They are like devils.

484
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,640
Your father is now sidelined by illness.

485
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
They resist your authority

486
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,839
and try to bully you.

487
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,719
It doesn't surprise me at all.

488
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,719
I know I'm crude and unlearned.

489
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,040
I don't blame them for
not agreeing with me.

490
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,735
Actually, I've been thinking of

491
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,400
turning the business of transportation
and opium growing

492
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,520
over to them.

493
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,839
I don't think it's a good idea.

494
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,250
The two parts of business account for

495
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,400
60% or 70% of your family business.

496
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,000
Don't be impulsive

497
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,520
and give up on your family business

498
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,160
just because of a little frustration.

499
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,640
It wasn't easy for your father
to build the business empire,

500
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,550
you must maintain his achievements.

501
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,920
Mr. Hashimoto, don't worry.

502
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,079
The contracts we signed before
are still valid.

503
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,959
The managers who take over the business

504
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,119
will continue to fulfill them.

505
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,040
They are all experienced.

506
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,280
They're

507
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,239
more reliable than me.

508
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:46,675
Jiashang,

509
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
I'm not worrying about that.

510
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,400
I just can't bear to see

511
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,525
you giving up your family business.

512
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,725
If you have any difficulties,

513
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:55,950
just tell me.

514
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,825
I'll help you.

515
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,400
Mr. Hashimoto,

516
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,400
do you have any bright ideas?

517
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,450
You and Shiori

518
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,079
once had a relationship,

519
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,880
but you were young then.

520
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,239
It didn't last long.

521
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,160
When I knew about it,

522
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,550
you were already engaged with Miss Du.

523
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,525
I felt so sorry.

524
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:19,100
Now you've broken off

525
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,359
your engagement to Miss Du,

526
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,239
would you consider

527
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,175
being together with Shiori?

528
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,514
You'll be a perfect match

529
00:28:26,514 --> 00:28:27,475
with equal social status.

530
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:29,195
Besides, you had a bond years ago.

531
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,950
Though Shiori was born of a concubine,

532
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,625
she isn't inferior to others

533
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,184
in terms of appearance and talent.

534
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,750
Mr. Hashimoto,

535
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,079
I'm grateful you are worrying about me

536
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,640
and willing to help me.

537
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,816
But I'm still young.

538
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:48,995
Getting married

539
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,785
is too early for me.

540
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,625
It seems that you really want to

541
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,825
give up your family business.

542
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,319
What did your father say?

543
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,239
I'm in charge of

544
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,160
all my family business now.

545
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,350
You made the decision

546
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,325
on impulse.

547
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,560
It will be too late

548
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,200
if you regret in future.

549
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,599
Uncle, I don't agree with you.

550
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,520
Other than the transportation business
and the southern plantations,

551
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,040
we own construction
and trade companies.

552
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,975
Though they're not so profitable as the
transportation and opium growing,

553
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:22,600
they are enough to support

554
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
the whole family.

555
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,000
Young man,

556
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,760
you have no ambition.

557
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,199
Some blood money is sinful

558
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,250
that I'd better not make.

559
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,680
And, since my father was shot,

560
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,800
he's been thinking he had done
too many evil things in his early years

561
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
that he got punished.

562
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,640
So I'm going to

563
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,325
do the right things after selling

564
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,625
those parts of our business.

565
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,109
I'm doing good things for my family.

566
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,800
Uncle.

567
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:49,719
I have a cautious
and conservative nature.

568
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,350
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

569
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,800
Jiashang,

570
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,979
I sincerely hope to cooperate with you.

571
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:58,556
Thanks for your appreciation.

572
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,400
If there's nothing else,

573
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,280
I shall leave.

574
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,500
Jiashang.

575
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,075
Jiashang.

576
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,200
I asked my father to invite you over.

577
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,599
As long as you need,

578
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,825
- my family...
- Shiori.

579
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:37,701
Thanks for your kindness.

580
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:41,626
But I'm used to separate

581
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,225
relationships from business.

582
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,344
If you think
I'm in a difficult situation

583
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:47,400
and want to give me a hand,

584
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,280
it's unnecessary.

585
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,919
I don't want to

586
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,880
rely on women.

587
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,319
Jiashang, it's not like that.

588
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,040
I really like you.

589
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,680
Otherwise,

590
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,319
I wouldn't have suggested Father

591
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,375
unite your family by marriage.

592
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,680
I really want to marry you.

593
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,550
When we were in Chongqing,

594
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,079
it was just a crush
between two teenagers.

595
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
It wasn't even a serious relationship.

596
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,969
I'm in love with someone else now.

597
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,000
We should move on

598
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,280
and look forward.

599
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,174
You should forget it, too.

600
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,600
Jiashang.

601
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,075
Jiashang.

602
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,525
Miss Feng.

603
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,959
This is the telegram
we just intercepted.

604
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:28,850
Zhao Hua'an has upgraded
his transportation code.

605
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:32,300
(February 28,
No. 12 of Ping'an Street, Tengchong)

606
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,305
You cracked the code?

607
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,850
Well done.

608
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,159
Come on, let's have a drink.

609
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,825
OK.

610
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:57,704
A toast to...

611
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:00,040
To our success.

612
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,719
Yes.

613
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,650
To our success.

614
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:05,900
Sit down.

615
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,760
The Rong Family will ship a cargo
at the beginning of the year.

616
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,475
The managers really fear nothing.

617
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:20,416
I've checked the next
destination of the cargo.

618
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,120
Most they shipped

619
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,800
are contraband goods
other than the goods of the company.

620
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:26,646
I thought when

621
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,446
Qin Shuigen was in charge,

622
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,760
the company was better managed.

623
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,199
But it seems now

624
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,639
Qin Shuigen

625
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,840
couldn't do anything to his men
who had made great contributions.

626
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,360
So,

627
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,800
the Rong Family

628
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:39,375
is destined to break up.

629
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:41,925
(Zhao Hua'an, No. 2 of the
Rong Company, Breaks with the Rongs)

630
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:42,900
(Share Transfer Contract
to Be Signed Today)

631
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,120
The Rong Family...

632
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:47,840
What do you think

633
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,175
Rong Jiashang is going to do?

634
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,919
Will he turn over

635
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,320
all the gray business

636
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,679
to Zhao Hua'an as rumor says?

637
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,875
Let's wait and see.

638
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,350
Actually, I'm thinking

639
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:08,514
the gray income and business

640
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,120
are disgusting

641
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:11,560
and outrageous.

642
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,575
But the profit is tremendous.

643
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,039
He has no reason to turn down the money.

644
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,000
If it was me,

645
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,959
I would work with Zhao Hua'an,

646
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
so he'll do all the work
and I'll make money.

647
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,320
Two birds with one stone.

648
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,050
I don't think Rong Jiashang

649
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,906
likes to sit idle
and enjoy the fruits of others' work.

650
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,975
As the saying goes,

651
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:46,225
beauty is in the eye of the lover.

652
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,560
I've long broken up with him.

653
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,879
You've been at home long enough.

654
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,159
You need to get out and relax.

655
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,250
How about this?

656
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:02,320
I'll ask Baoli to take you out tomorrow

657
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,479
and show you around.

658
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,625
I'd love to.

659
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,040
Come on.

660
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,329
It's beautiful.

661
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,399
Baoli, enough.

662
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,500
We've bought too many clothes.

663
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,820
I don't need so many.

664
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,320
Stop complaining.

665
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,070
They're nowhere near enough.

666
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,840
You're working with Mr. Meng.

667
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,950
If people see

668
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,719
his woman in shabby clothes,

669
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,000
they would think he's stingy.

670
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,450
I'm not his woman.

671
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,676
All right, don't take it seriously.

672
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,879
Isn't the dress a little long?

673
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
It's okay.

674
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,025
Just my size.

675
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,350
Miss.

676
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,280
Do you have another dress
of the same style,

677
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,159
but a little shorter?

678
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:52,600
Yes. I'll go get it.

679
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,159
OK.

680
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,639
Don't bother.

681
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,875
It's just fine.

682
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:59,040
Short dresses are in vogue in Paris
and New York these days.

683
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,479
Let me find you a fashion magazine.

684
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,159
(The Rongs Are Falling Apart)
Weak Leader and strong members,

685
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,959
the Rongs are falling apart.

686
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,560
It sounds right.

687
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,651
In his early twentieth,

688
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,919
he is still young.

689
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:29,605
It's normal
he can't suppress the veterans.

690
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,879
But in my opinion,

691
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,040
the Rong Family

692
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,320
could live like a king

693
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,075
relying on foreign trade
and real estate.

694
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:39,300
They don't have to do

695
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,340
the wicked and risky business.

696
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,500
Alright.

697
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,775
Don't read it again.

698
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,450
Let's try some more.

699
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,320
How do you like this?

700
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,011
Come.

701
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,446
Let's see.

702
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:02,875
(Rong)

703
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:33,200
Young Master, it's time to go.

704
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:06,399
Perfect timing.

705
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,639
Just now,

706
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,380
several southern factions of the
Rong Family fought among themselves.

707
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,401
Three of their opium plantations
were destroyed.

708
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,800
Vehicles with iron chains

709
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,399
around the tires
were driven into the fields

710
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,075
and the newly planted bulbs were
all crushed.

711
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,399
So next,

712
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,600
what do you think we should do?

713
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,520
Though Zhao Hua'an
took the shares of the company,

714
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,840
the other covetous shareholders

715
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:37,065
are probably scheming to
bring him down.

716
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:38,825
I'm thinking,

717
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,000
at this time,

718
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,600
if we write a secret letter to them,

719
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:43,760
and inform them of

720
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,600
the destination of
Zhao's most important cargo,

721
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:47,919
I think,

722
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:50,050
they'll do us a favor

723
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:52,560
and make some trouble for Zhao.

724
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,879
Brilliant.

725
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:00,600
This man's surname is Liu.

726
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,950
He is one of Zhao Hua'an's
most important opponents.

727
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,360
(Liu Sanwan)
They are equal in strength in the south.

728
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,154
Mr. Meng,

729
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,200
I think you've already made plans.

730
00:41:12,675 --> 00:41:14,550
