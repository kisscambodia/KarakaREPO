00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,300
Fire!

4
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,350
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire!

5
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,440
- Fire! Hurry.
- Go put out the fire!

6
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,480
Go put out the fire!

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,400
Be quick.

8
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:45,525
The West Hall is on fire!

9
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:46,839
- Hurry, hurry.
- Hurry, hurry.

10
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,720
Hurry.

11
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,680
Put out the fire.

12
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,440
Hurry, hurry.

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,160
- Put out the fire!
- Fire!

14
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,279
- Here's the water.
- Put out the fire!

15
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:51,975
Hurry.

16
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,160
Ma'am.

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,600
What's on fire? What happened?

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,879
- The West Hall is on fire.
- Go put out the fire. Hurry.

19
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,959
It's on fire for a while.

20
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:58,760
Where's Master? Have you got him out?

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,080
Don't worry, Ma'am.

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,275
Master is out.

23
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,775
We've sent him to the main house.

24
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:03,599
I'm relieved, then.

25
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,390
- Go get Mr. Jiashang back.
- What are you waiting for? Put out the fire.

26
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,275
- Go, go.
- Yes.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,081
- Come on.
- Be quick. Be quick.

28
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,446
Water. Hurry.

29
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:12,875
Here's the water. Here it is.

30
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,225
Hurry. Hurry.

31
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,440
Here's the water.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,360
Put out the fire!

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,479
Hello.

34
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:58,600
It's me.

35
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,250
Would you like to make a deal with me?

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,440
Don't worry.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,800
After you make it,

38
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,205
you will get

39
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,645
whatever you want.

40
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:11,720
Don't let me down.

41
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:27,720
Jiashang.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,679
Why was the West Hall on fire?

43
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,520
I don't know.

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,875
The fire wasn't big
and it was put out quickly.

45
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:31,600
What about Father?

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,150
He was got out. He's in the main house.

47
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,550
Who were you calling, Father?

48
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:57,555
The Fire Station.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,919
Somebody.

50
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,240
Clean up my father's room.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,559
Take him back for some rest.

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Without my permission,

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,150
he mustn't leave the second floor.

54
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,825
- Yes.
- Yes.

55
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,000
Father,

56
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,040
please stay at home obediently

57
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,075
and play no more tricks.

58
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,100
Son,

59
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,369
you don't understand

60
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,880
what a man can do

61
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,700
to protect his family.

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,350
Whoever wants to ruin my family,

63
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,595
I will destroy him, too.

64
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,030
What do you want to do again?

65
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:08,679
Keep an eye on him.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,725
- Yes.
- Yes.

67
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,160
Hello.

68
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,166
Is the dress that I booked
the day before yesterday ready?

69
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,959
Miss Feng, my boss wants to see you.

70
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,000
Come with us.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,850
Go.

(Goldfarm Atelier de Couture)

73
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,640
Newspapers.

74
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,079
Revolutionaries will be wiped out.

75
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,500
Who covers them will be executed, too.

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,850
- Wen.
- Newspapers.

77
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,480
Thank you.

78
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,000
- Why is the government checking
- Revolutionaries will be wiped out.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,839
- the insurgents again?
- Who covers them will be executed, too.

80
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,880
What a mess!

81
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,600
Don't ask when we're not involved.

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,875
- Or Mr. Meng will criticize you.
- Newspapers.

83
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,175
Newspapers.

84
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,339
The... the bag...

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,399
Whose bag is it?

86
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,000
It's Miss Feng's bag.

87
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,950
She forgot to take it
when she got off, I guess.

88
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,359
Here. Hold it for me.

89
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,600
Wait here for me.
I'll go give it to her.

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,200
All right.

91
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,731
Miss Feng.

92
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,375
Where's the lady
who came to fetch her dress?

93
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:31,545
She was kidnapped.

94
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,925
They ran that way.

95
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,525
Oh, no!

96
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,949
Sir,

97
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,085
may I open the window?

98
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,275
I feel too dizzy.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,440
Let her do it.

100
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,079
She can't run away from the car, anyway.

101
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,825
Don't make her scared to death
before we arrive.

102
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,670
Thank you.

103
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,239
Sorry. Sorry to have hit you.

104
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,040
Are you all right?

105
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,089
Yes.

106
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,350
Where did you get it?

107
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,720
I picked it up.

108
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,679
Where did you pick it up?

109
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,850
Over there.

110
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,200
Take me there.

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,460
Where?

112
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,959
Over there.

113
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,040
There.

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,959
Here?

115
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,519
Thank you, then.

116
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,875
What did you say?

117
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,919
Say it again!

118
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:57,880
Miss Feng...

119
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
She was kidnapped.

120
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,250
Wen is catching up.

121
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,411
He asked me to come back and tell you.

122
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,354
Where was the car going?

123
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,679
To the south of the city
out of the tailor shop.

124
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,840
I don't know

125
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,960
where it was going later.

126
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,640
Take all our men
and search the south of the city

127
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,375
in teams.

128
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,640
Search from door to door.

129
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,479
If you find anything,

130
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,320
let me know.

131
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,919
All right.

132
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,420
In broad daylight,

133
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,840
who dared to kidnap her?

134
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,679
Who else can it be?

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,375
If Shizhen is hurt,

136
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,760
I'll cut him into pieces!

137
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,925
It's you?

138
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:08,674
Sorry, Miss Feng.

139
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,900
But if I didn't kidnap you,

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
I wouldn't have got you here.

141
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,100
Miss Hashimoto, why did you
take the trouble

142
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,320
to have kidnapped me

143
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,250
to this place?

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,050
To kill you.

145
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,164
I don't think you hate me a lot.

146
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,320
Why do you want to kill me?

147
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
You're wrong.

148
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,125
I hate you.

149
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,641
You're quite self-righteous.

150
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,006
You pretend to be aloof and proud.

151
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,725
But you're just a poor governess
who's good at stealing.

152
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,514
Do you know how you'll end up
for stealing my man?

153
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,154
Stealing your man?

154
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:57,014
That's not the right way to put it.

155
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,850
Rong Jiashang and I

156
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,981
attracted each other.

157
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,450
How shameless!

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,120
You finally admit
that you seduced Jiashang?

159
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:10,320
We like each other.

160
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,439
Why would I deny it?

161
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,355
Wrong!

162
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,200
He loves me.

163
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,210
You don't know anything.

164
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,725
You don't know
what happened between us.

165
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,450
When we were in Chongqing,

166
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,176
Jiashang said

167
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,425
I was the camellia in the mountain.

168
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,414
He listened when I played the piano.

169
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,239
He walked me home.

170
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,925
He even fought others for me.

171
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,469
But after I met him again,

172
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,130
everything changed.

173
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,030
I've been so nice to him.

174
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,200
But he totally ignores me.

175
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,744
Now, I have a sweetheart.

176
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,679
A man must move on

177
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,960
and look forward.

178
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,275
You should also drag yourself
out of the past.

179
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,479
It's all because of you!

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Without you,

181
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,750
Jiashang and I would have
got back together!

182
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,411
Are you so sure

183
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:12,055
that after you kill me,

184
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,400
Rong Jiashang will love you?

185
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,479
Don't you know?

186
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,381
Men are all the same.

187
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,159
A man wants a woman
who he can't have.

188
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,475
After he has her,

189
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,050
he'll no longer cherish her.

190
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,799
I still have some confusion.

191
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,520
Miss Hashimoto, you're from
such a good family

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
and you can pick from many men.

193
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:46,104
Why must you be obsessed
with Rong Jiashang?

194
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,026
Those men are different.

195
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,350
How can such playboys be
as good as Jiashang?

196
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,019
Besides,

197
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,200
he's the only heir of the Rong family.

198
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,425
Rong Dingkun promised me.

199
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
After you die,

200
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,325
I'll be Jiashang's wife.

201
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:16,925
What are you laughing at?

202
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,149
I thought you were a clever woman.

203
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,723
But you turned out to be so naive.

204
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,825
When used as Rong Dingkun's chess piece,

205
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:25,075
you didn't realize it at all.

206
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,840
How pathetic you are!

207
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,529
Think about it.

208
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,921
Before Rong Dingkun was disabled,

209
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:33,575
Rong Jiashang never took his orders.

210
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:36,159
Now, will he be ordered about

211
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,880
by a disabled old man?

212
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,269
In fact,

213
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,904
you never love Rong Jiashang

214
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,346
but his identity and property.

215
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,949
You're such a selfish woman.

216
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,050
Jiashang will never love you.

217
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,875
Shut up!

218
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,244
What do you think you are?

219
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:03,365
How dare you

220
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:04,725
judge me!

221
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,119
Look at your beautiful face.

222
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,719
If it's scratched,

223
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:25,559
will Jiashang still be crazy about it?

224
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,975
Qin Shuigen!

225
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,239
- Mr. Meng.
- Come out!

226
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:32,385
There's no Qin Shuigen here, Mr. Meng.

227
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,999
No one in our residence is named Qin.

228
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,574
Mr. Meng,

229
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:37,825
what are you coming for?

230
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,080
Mr. Jiashang.

231
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,975
Why do you have the nerve to ask me?

232
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,679
Your father had Shizhen kidnapped.

233
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,320
I want you to give her back to me.

234
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,700
Nonsense!

235
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,960
Shizhen was kidnapped.

236
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:49,280
Who else would do that,

237
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,321
except your father?

238
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:51,616
No way.

239
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,220
He's been watched over.

240
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:56,076
Mr. Jiashang,

241
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,570
go ask your father, then.

242
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,625
Meng Xu'an.

243
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,200
What a rare visitor!

244
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,125
- Meng Xu'an!
- Tell me.

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,479
Where is Feng Shizhen?

246
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,400
Why must I tell you?

247
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:23,600
Believe it or not, I'll shoot you!

248
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,760
If you kill me,

249
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,125
you can never see her again.

250
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:28,575
Father,

251
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:30,974
you indeed had her kidnapped?

252
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,950
Where's Shizhen?

253
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:38,296
If she's hurt,

254
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,320
I'll cut you into pieces!

255
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,325
Jiashang,

256
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,796
will you just watch it

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
when he points at your father
with a gun?

258
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,841
Meng Xu'an.

259
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,880
Father,

260
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,900
please tell me

261
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,331
where Shizhen is.

262
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,550
As long as you tell us,

263
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,600
you won't be hurt.

264
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,059
I'll even return the power to you

265
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,960
without reserve.

266
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:37,385
Good son.

267
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,706
However,

268
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,080
it's too late.

269
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,925
You'll never see her again.

270
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,576
What did you say?

271
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:53,704
What on earth did you do?

272
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,960
Mr. Meng,

273
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,299
we've found Wen's car.

274
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,880
You'd better pray
that Shizhen is all right.

275
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,595
Let's go.

276
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,839
What a sunny day!

277
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,775
Don't worry.

278
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,345
I won't kill you so easily.

279
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,950
I'll scratch your face

280
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,650
stroke by stroke

281
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,325
and make you witness the process.

282
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,670
I'll see how you can
still seduce Jiashang.

283
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,800
How dare you kick me!

284
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,959
You cheap woman!

285
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,581
You cheap woman!

286
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,700
Die, you cheap woman!

287
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,079
Miss Feng, are you all right?

288
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:20,839
Wen.

289
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,875
Wen, watch out!

290
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,600
Miss Feng, be careful!

291
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
Are you all right?

292
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:57,200
Wen.

293
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,239
Wen.

294
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,315
Wen. Wen.

295
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,319
- Wen.
- Wen.

296
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,160
Wen.

297
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,250
Wen.

298
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,275
Wen.

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,359
Zhen?

300
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,875
(Zhen)

301
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,750
(July 24, Year of Guisi)

302
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,319
Li?

303
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,224
He's my younger brother.

304
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,439
How come?

305
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,616
He's my brother.

306
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,325
How can you be my brother?

307
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,199
Li.

308
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,439
Li.

309
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,880
Get him up. Get him to the hospital.

310
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,700
Save him first.

311
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,800
- Somebody.
- Somebody.

312
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,875
Get him to the hospital. Hurry!

313
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:48,525
Yes.

314
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:49,566
- Li!
- Go.

315
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,560
Li.

316
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,599
Hurry.

317
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,359
- Go.
- Hurry.

318
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,319
Save him.

319
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,350
Hurry!

320
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,560
Doctor! Doctor!

321
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,520
Doctor!

322
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,125
Doctor, hurry!

323
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,700
(OR, in operation)

324
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,075
(In operation)

325
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,560
The operation was successful.

326
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:49,079
He's no longer in danger.

327
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,359
However,

328
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,760
his brain was starved of oxygen
from excessive blood loss.

329
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,199
He's now in a coma.

330
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,910
When he can wake up

331
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,250
depends on his luck.

332
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,650
Would you like

333
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:32,276
to have some rest?

334
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,240
I'll ask someone to take care of him.

335
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,025
(July 24, Year of Guisi)

336
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:49,905
(July 24, Year of Guisi)
The 27th year of Emperor Guangxu.

337
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,225
July 24.

338
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,826
Half past one

339
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,475
in the afternoon.

340
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,736
It's my birth date.

341
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,009
This is my longevity lock.

342
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,189
Li,

343
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,691
you turn out to be around all the time,

344
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,886
protecting me.

345
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:39,645
You will wake up.

346
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,125
I'll accompany you.

347
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,475
It was negligent of me.

348
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,490
I should have come earlier.

349
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,306
Mr. Meng,

350
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,160
how's Li been doing

351
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,400
in recent years?

352
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:08,834
I remember

353
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,199
when I first met him,

354
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,225
he was roaming about

355
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,310
on the street.

356
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,599
I thought he was a poor boy.

357
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,750
I gave him some money
and talked with him.

358
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,086
He was very clever

359
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,300
and he was a quick learner.

360
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,425
I liked him.

361
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,350
So, I've kept him working for me.

362
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,225
I wish I were lying in bed.

363
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,700
He's so young.

364
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,599
Listen.

365
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,820
According to the doctor,

366
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,880
he's still in a coma.

367
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,599
However,

368
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:59,599
he isn't in danger.

369
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:02,760
Don't worry.

370
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,280
I promise that he'll wake up.

371
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,439
Just now,

372
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,359
I was too busy to ask you.

373
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,385
Shizhen,

374
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:24,280
what happened? Why is Wen...?

375
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,625
It's my fault.

376
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,151
It's some business conflict.

377
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:29,479
You know.

378
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,650
People like us

379
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,775
often have conflicts.

380
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,150
Shizhen,

381
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,550
come out with me.

382
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,680
All right.

383
00:25:52,725 --> 00:26:01,775
(Red House Hospital,
Infusion Room, Wards 1-8)

384
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,760
Shizhen,

385
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,075
I know.

386
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,079
Mr. Meng helped you a lot.

387
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:11,850
But he's a gangster, after all.

388
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,000
He's way too dangerous.

389
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,680
You'd better have less contact with him

390
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,560
in case we worry about you.

391
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:21,000
Shixun,

392
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,150
you know what?

393
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,731
Wen is

394
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
my younger brother
I've been looking for.

395
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:37,926
Brother?

396
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,209
His real name is Li.

397
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:50,650
We lost each other for years.

398
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,280
I've been looking for him.

399
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,500
I've finally found him.

400
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,570
Shizhen, don't cry.

401
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,599
It's all right. Don't cry.

402
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,500
Don't be sad.

403
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,439
He'll be all right.

404
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,415
Everything will be all right.

405
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,575
Stop crying.

406
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,045
Do you have any feelings?

407
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:40,850
Mr. Hashimoto.

408
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,079
Yes, please.

409
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,160
Your daughter's leg was wounded

410
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,000
without timely treatment.

411
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,661
I'm afraid

412
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:48,942
she can hardly recover

413
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:51,345
and she'll have a permanent disability.

414
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,259
How come?

415
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,880
I was just shot.

416
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,850
Why would I be disabled?

417
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,600
You useless doctor!

418
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,425
Get out!

419
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:01,575
- Out!
- Shiori.

420
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:02,174
But...

421
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,319
Fine.

422
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,175
Sorry.

423
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,199
Please leave.

424
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:09,920
This way, please.

425
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,599
Fine.

426
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:14,354
Mr. Hashimoto,
don't bother to walk me out.

427
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:19,434
Father, get me to another hospital.

428
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:20,839
I'm leaving today.

429
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,359
How do you have the nerve
to lose your temper?

430
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
You brought such trouble

431
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
to yourself.

432
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,850
You've disgraced our family!

433
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:32,640
You look obedient.

434
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,475
But you did such a terrible thing.

435
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,150
We don't know

436
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,719
what else you did behind us.

437
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,500
Father.

438
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,640
Father, help me.

439
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,199
I'll be obedient.

440
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,225
I won't make trouble anymore.

441
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:46,075
I'm still young.
I don't want to be lame.

442
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:47,075
Shut up!

443
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,875
Don't you feel humiliated enough?

444
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,640
Mr. Rong.

445
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Mr. Hashimoto.

446
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,586
Mrs. Hashimoto.

447
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:05,975
I came to see Shiori.

448
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,625
Thank you, Mr. Rong.

449
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:11,150
But I'm afraid

450
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,075
Shiori is emotionally unstable now.

451
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,200
It doesn't matter.

452
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,775
Could you give us a second?

453
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:35,650
Jiashang, there you are.

454
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,800
What would you like to say?

455
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:45,494
I was forced

456
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,175
to kidnap Miss Feng.

457
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,125
Your father forced me to kill her.

458
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:50,595
I didn't want that.

459
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:52,675
Shiori,

460
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,950
you shouldn't have hurt her.

461
00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:58,280
I know.

462
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,280
But I can't stand it

463
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,520
when she stole all your attention.

464
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
You were supposed to focus on me.

465
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,520
I want her dead.
I want her to drop dead!

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,239
As long as she dies

467
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,520
and disappears,

468
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,000
you'll love me again.

469
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,805
When we met last time,

470
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,040
I explained it to you very clearly.

471
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,920
Even without Shizhen,

472
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,119
I wouldn't love you

473
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,121
or marry you.

474
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,725
Why?

475
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,775
Why?

476
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,425
You used to love me
in Chongqing, didn't you?

477
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:31,959
That day,

478
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:34,705
I heard your conversation

479
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,025
with your mother.

480
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,095
Mother,

481
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,250
Jiashang came to listen to me
play the piano again today.

482
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,280
He likes me, I guess.

483
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:54,794
Do you like him, then?

484
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,050
I don't know.

485
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,525
But we won't be together.

486
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:04,800
Why?

487
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,225
He's a handsome man, isn't he?

488
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,775
He is handsome.

489
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,620
But I hear

490
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:15,400
he's from a poor family.

491
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,520
I'm on good terms with him,

492
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,975
simply to play him.

493
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,920
Anyway,

494
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,400
I'm Mr. Hashimoto's daughter.

495
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,300
If one day Father thinks of us

496
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,579
and gets us back,

497
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,319
he won't be

498
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,100
good enough for me then.

499
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,600
Jiashang...

500
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,475
I was standing by the door that day.

501
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,479
I didn't give you the flowers that day.

502
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,014
I won't give them to you again.

503
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,959
Jiashang.

504
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,119
Jiashang.

505
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,520
Jiashang, I'm sorry.

506
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,275
Jiashang, forgive me.

507
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,600
Jiashang. Jiashang.

508
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,575
I'm sorry.

509
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,319
Jiashang, forgive me.

510
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,280
Forgive me, please.

511
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,180
I... I didn't understand.

512
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,560
I didn't understand love.

513
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,800
I was too childish!

514
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,325
Forgive me, Jiashang!

515
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:13,274
Everyone has to pay for what he does.

516
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,501
Hope you'll wise up.

517
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,319
Jiashang, Jiashang!

518
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,439
Jiashang!

519
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,076
Jiashang!

520
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,525
Jiashang!

521
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,025
How's Shiori?

522
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,205
Jiashang!

523
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,790
I picked this up

524
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,439
at the auction.

525
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,725
I'm giving it back to you.

526
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,640
See you.

527
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,668
(Hashimoto Taichi)

528
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,040
Don't worry, Ma'am.

529
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
I've brought his medicine.

530
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,450
Take a breath. Hurry.

531
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:35,325
Taichi, take the medicine.

532
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:38,074
Taichi, don't panic.

533
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:56,479
Father.

534
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,959
Father, I don't want to get married.

535
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:01,000
Father, save me. Father.

536
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,100
Father.

537
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,450
Father.

538
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,950
Father.

539
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:09,120
I don't want to marry Matsuda, Father.

540
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:10,439
Father,

541
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,399
I beg you!

542
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,639
- Father.
- Shiori.

543
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,239
Your marriage has been decided.

544
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,350
Say no more about it!

545
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,475
Shiori.

546
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,679
Say no more, Shiori.

547
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,600
Go. Say no more.

548
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,679
Don't annoy Father.

549
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,775
Go, Shiori.

550
00:34:26,479 --> 00:34:27,750
I beg you.

551
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,959
I don't want to marry Matsuda, Father.

552
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:32,800
Mr. Matsuda agrees to marry you

553
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,400
for your father's sake.

554
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:35,800
Shiori,

555
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,750
what you should do now is

556
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,280
to marry Mr. Matsuda

557
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,150
and take good care of him,

558
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,490
helping with your father's relationship
with the Japanese military.

559
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:51,000
Learn to be content.

560
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,520
No.

561
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,840
No.

562
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,150
I don't want to marry him.

563
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:04,600
Father,

564
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,360
I hear Colonel Matsuda

565
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,800
can be very ruthless.

566
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,325
His wives...

567
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:10,320
His former wives

568
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,959
died after being abused by him.

569
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:12,775
Father.

570
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,175
Nonsense!

571
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,080
He's from a notable family.
He won't abuse you!

572
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,625
Father.

573
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,870
Father.

574
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:25,995
Father.

575
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,239
Father! Father!

576
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,275
Father! Father!

577
00:35:31,525 --> 00:35:32,399
Father!

578
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,600
Mother.

579
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,350
Mother.

580
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,879
Mother.

581
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:50,800
I beg you.

582
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,950
Help me. Help me.

583
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:54,639
Help me, please.

584
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,080
I don't want to die.

585
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,150
Mother.

586
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,080
Tell me...

587
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,959
Tell me to do anything.

588
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,120
I'll be your slave.

589
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,925
I can do anything for you.

590
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:04,825
Have pity on me.

591
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,825
Have pity on you?

592
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:19,450
Do you really think
you can deceive everyone?

593
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,000
You killed my son.

594
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:29,215
Do you think I'll make you
live a good life?

595
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,120
Mother, what are you talking about?

596
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,920
I'll watch you

597
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,650
be tortured forever.

598
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:46,375
Marry Matsuda and enjoy the good life.

599
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,239
Mr. Matsuda promised me.

600
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,200
He said

601
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,720
he would be nice to you

602
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:54,625
and you wouldn't die easily.

603
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:02,959
Take your sister away

604
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,725
and keep an eye on her.

605
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,800
Don't let her run away

606
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,411
or kill herself.

607
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,800
Before she marries Matsuda,

608
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,399
if anything happens,

609
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,110
I'll make you wish
you were never born.

610
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:22,700
Do you hear me?

611
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,475
Out!

612
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:26,719
Shiori, let's go.

613
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,750
Let's go, Shiori.

614
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,150
Let's go.

615
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,120
Somebody.

616
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:32,875
Shiori.

617
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,950
Nowadays,

618
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,159
big powers collude

619
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
to invade our nation
and kill our countrymen.

620
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,639
Warlords keep fighting wars.

621
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:54,199
The government is incompetent.

622
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,475
- Yeah.
- That's right.

623
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,239
- Yes.
- Mm.

624
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,320
The assembly will be in three days.

625
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,525
You shall all get ready.

626
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:00,207
- Mm.
- Mm.

627
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:00,840
- We will.
- We will.

628
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Shixun and I

629
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,760
will come from the south

630
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,719
with the workers from the textile mill.

631
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
You shall come from the north

632
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,239
with the students.

633
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:07,840
All right.

634
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,399
Let's meet at No. 16 Terminal.

635
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,239
Deal.

636
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,075
Deal.

637
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:12,360
Nobody moves!

638
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:16,300
What...

639
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,100
Be right there.

640
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,975
Be right there.

641
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:26,959
Ms. Zhong?

642
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:27,800
Mrs. Feng,

643
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,575
- your son was caught.
- Ah?

644
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,040
When I passed the newspaper office,

645
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,919
I saw the police catch
a group of young men.

646
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,560
Your son was among them.

647
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,100
Go check it out in the police station.

648
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,760
What happened?

649
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,959
Shixun was caught.

650
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:38,600
Our son?

651
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,159
Speak slowly.

652
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,320
Don't be anxious, Mother.

653
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,719
Aunt Zhong, did you see it clearly?

654
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,760
Was that really my brother?

655
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,360
Yes, yes. I saw it clearly.
That was him.

656
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,159
I took a closer look at him.

657
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,320
It's the newspaper office

658
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,919
at the bridgehead.

659
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,159
What's its name?

660
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,520
I can't think of it at the moment.

661
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,679
Father, don't be anxious.

662
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,350
I'll go check it out.

663
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,199
Ms. Zhong, did you see it clearly?

664
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,479
Yes, yes. That was him.

665
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,479
No way!

666
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:00,725
Shixun has no friends
in a newspaper office.

667
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,479
Yeah.

668
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:02,775
What on earth happened?

669
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,050
Father, don't worry.

670
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,360
Mother, I'll go check on him.

671
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,239
Wait until I come back.

672
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:06,959
- Wait for me.
- All right.

673
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:07,760
Go check it out.

674
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,400
Shizhen.

675
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,719
- Be careful. Be careful.
- Shizhen, be careful.

676
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,719
You should be careful, too.

677
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,679
Shizhen!

678
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:15,244
Our family must be sticking together!

679
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,800
Hello.

680
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:48,415
Mr. Jiashang, it's me.

681
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,600
What's up?

682
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,840
The man spying on Miss Feng reported

683
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,439
that her brother was caught

684
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:55,375
as a revolutionary.

685
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:09,100
(Songhu Police Station)

686
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,400
Excuse me.

687
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,200
Register before you report a case.

688
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,250
I don't report a case.

689
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,550
I came to see someone.

690
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,325
(Songhu Police Station)

691
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:19,380
See someone?

692
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:20,175
Right.

693
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:21,264
Who?

694
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:22,995
A man, named Feng Shixun.

695
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:24,760
He's a doctor at Red House Hospital.

696
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,719
He's among the guys
you caught this evening.

697
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:28,675
He's my elder brother. I'm his sister.

698
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,159
I want to see him.

699
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,040
Who are you?

700
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,721
You think you own the police station

701
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:36,201
and you can see anyone you want?

702
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,311
Could you do me a favor?

703
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:49,666
They are no longer here.

704
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:50,975
Where have they been taken?

705
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,600
Do you know where they are?

706
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:02,800
They were sent to Tilanqiao Prison.

707
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:05,159
As their case is confidential,

708
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,078
the superiors will
interrogate them personally.

709
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:09,959
Please do me a favor.

710
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:10,975
I want to see him.

711
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:12,479
Miss,

712
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:13,840
I can't help you.

713
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,500
This is all that I know.

714
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,159
They're insurgents.

715
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:18,486
If anything goes wrong,

716
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,550
they'll die.

717
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,919
My brother is a mere doctor.

718
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:22,760
He can't be the one you want.

719
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,550
We don't care.

720
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Now that he's in prison,

721
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,850
he'll be charged at whatever cost.

722
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,199
I'm afraid

723
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,399
your brother can hardly survive.

724
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,159
Tilanqiao Prison?

725
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,375
Who's that?

726
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:46,800
Baoli.

727
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,550
Shizhen?

728
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,529
What happened?

729
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,480
Why did you come
in the middle of the night?

730
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,280
Baoli,

731
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,680
please help me.

732
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,525
What happened?

733
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:55,550
Listen.

734
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,070
My brother was caught by the police
as an insurgent.

735
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,390
I've got to know

736
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,750
that they're locked in Tilanqiao Prison.

737
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,840
Can you find a way

738
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,250
to let me see him?

739
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,400
Insurgent?

740
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:05,950
Mm.

741
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,639
Has your brother mentioned it to you?

742
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,600
No.

743
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,730
You know.

744
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,425
My brother keeps a low profile
and works hard.

745
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:13,280
He only works at the hospital
or stays at home.

746
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,560
He never makes trouble.

747
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:16,525
It's my fault.

748
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:18,625
I was so busy with my own business

749
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:20,885
that I didn't care about my brother.

750
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,600
Take it easy.

751
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:24,700
I've heard about hunting insurgents.

752
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,619
It was a sudden decision.

753
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,500
It's not your fault.

754
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,676
But I do have friends
at the police station.

755
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:31,919
I'll go ask about it for you.

756
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,399
Sure. I'll count on you.

757
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:34,725
