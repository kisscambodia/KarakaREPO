=Episode 25=

3
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:39,680
Essentially,

4
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,680
your family hurt him first.

5
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,559
I've got no complaints about him.

6
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:46,720
I just worry that you two can't help

7
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,160
exchanging love glances

8
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,199
so that others gossip about you.

9
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,720
When your sister sticks to him
like a dog,

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,080
how do I dare?

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,519
Fine, fine.

12
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:04,546
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,480
I shouldn't have
described Fanglin as a dog.

14
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,505
Don't you

15
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,279
have a plan?

16
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:13,639
Plan?

17
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,050
Do you and Miss Feng have a plan?

18
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,880
Everyone thinks alike
under the same case.

19
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,720
We'll just enjoy ourselves
as far as we can.

20
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,446
Life is long and boring.

21
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,779
Why can't we have some fun?

22
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,639
Some people noticed your affair.

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
My father got wind of it.

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
For your own good,

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,041
you'd better restrain yourself.

26
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,240
What does that mean?

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,399
Be seated.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,720
What exactly happened?

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,919
Hashimoto Shiori gave my father a photo

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,450
taken in the foyer
of the hotel in Hangzhou.

31
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,320
As for the man in the photo...

32
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,000
I guess you know it better than me.

33
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:57,187
Is he...?

34
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't worry.

35
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,880
Only the sight of his back.

36
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:02,725
Or why do you think

37
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,780
he can still play mahjong with my father

38
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,880
without any problem?

39
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,880
Your ex-girlfriend is
quite a big trouble.

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,960
What the heck!

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
In this case,

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,880
why didn't your father
break off our engagement?

43
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,960
Why does he pretend nothing happened?

44
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,080
Our families are

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,320
having important business cooperation.

46
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,970
My father won't fall out
with your family.

47
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,199
If your family is disgraced,

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,160
my father will lose this business.

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,919
After all,

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,079
compared to great wealth,

51
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,175
the marriage of his son is nothing.

52
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,160
What do you want, then?

53
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,950
You know exactly

54
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,075
what I want.

55
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,245
I never agree on our engagement.

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,039
What about you?

57
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,285
Are you serious

58
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,125
with Yang Xiucheng?

59
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,720
No, in the beginning.

60
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,725
But now...

61
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,900
Maybe.

62
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:13,000
Our engagement is a joke.

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,760
Time to put an end to it.

64
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,200
Mr. Jiashang.

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,925
Come on in.

66
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,160
Mr. Jiashang,

67
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,279
the mutton noodles you asked for.

68
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,440
Have some noodles first.

69
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,160
Let's talk later.

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,775
What's the smell?

71
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,125
What's wrong?

72
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,040
Lanxin?

73
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,550
Are you all right?

74
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,920
Yes.

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,359
Are you all right?

76
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,900
Maybe I had too much seafood at dinner.

77
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,075
I don't feel very well now.

78
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,279
I'm going back home.

79
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,839
Say goodbye to your parents for me.

80
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:41,720
Let's talk later

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,480
about the annulment of our engagement.

82
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:45,475
Fine.

83
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,725
Let me drive you back.

84
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,525
(Popular new movie,
Successful premiere)

85
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:54,425
She looks better in reality, I believe.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,944
She's so beautiful.

87
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,436
How elegant she is!

88
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:00,833
Take some photos.

89
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:02,877
She looks beautiful in the photo.

90
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:03,975
She must be more beautiful in reality.

91
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,600
Here comes Xiao Baoli!

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,920
Come on!

93
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,279
Go.

94
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,925
- Miss Baoli.
- Miss Baoli.

95
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,325
(Successful premiere of Miss Xiao's new movie)
Look this way. This way.

96
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,675
Miss Baoli,

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
how do you expect
the box office of your new movie?

98
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,640
It's said that you and Miss Lin
don't get along well on the set.

99
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,279
Is that true?

100
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,079
What do you think of the movie?

101
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,200
I certainly expect a big box office.

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,359
Miss Lin and I are good friends.

103
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,519
Why would we not get along well?

104
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,559
Besides, Miss Lin is

105
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,079
a senior movie actress.

106
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,359
I've got a lot to learn from her.

107
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,640
Mr. Song is a promising young man.

108
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,119
But we're just friends.

109
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,250
Miss Xiao is my honored guest.

110
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,000
She'll cut the ribbon for me.

111
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,279
If you still stop her,

112
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,880
she'll miss the propitious time.

113
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,050
Come on.

114
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,075
Fine. Let's be quick.

115
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,025
Let's take more photos.

116
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:50,993
Miss Xiao.

117
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,640
Miss Feng, every time I see you
at the ball,

118
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,625
you're eating.

119
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,040
Mr. Wu.

120
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,920
Long time no see.

121
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,559
Miss Feng, here I am.

122
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
Fanghua?

123
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,720
Why are you here?

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
My father allowed me to come.

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,440
In celebration

126
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,160
of the admission
to McTyeire School for Girls,

127
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,519
my sister and I are allowed
to come and see the movie actress.

128
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,675
Where's Fanglin?

129
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,001
She's over there with Jiashang.

130
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,175
I was not confident.

131
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,920
Miss Feng,

132
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,440
here we meet again.

133
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,625
Your dress seems

134
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,239
to be made by the Polish tailor

135
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,725
on West Sichuan Road.

136
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,640
Unexpectedly,

137
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,200
since you left the Rong family,

138
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
you've been living a better life.

139
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,480
I borrowed the dress from a friend.

140
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,760
It's not worth mentioning.

141
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,519
Looks like you have many friends.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,679
No wonder you wear different dresses

143
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,239
every time I see you.

144
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,920
Isn't it good to have many friends?

145
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,359
It is.

146
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,950
Your new sweetheart
and your ex-girlfriend are talking.

147
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,025
(Congratulate on the successful premiere
of Miss Xiao's new movie)

148
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,559
Don't you go handle that?

149
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,359
Just go.

150
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,239
I'm going to the Smoking Room
for a cigarette.

151
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,351
Miss Du,

152
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,450
the Smoking Room is full of men.

153
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,679
Let me have a cigarette with you
in the west small salon.

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,300
- Fanglin.
- Mm?

155
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,125
Wait a moment, please.

156
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
I'll be right back.

157
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,850
Mm. Fine.

158
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:48,434
Is that true?

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,880
- Jiashang.
- Mm.

160
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,300
The unveiling ceremony
will start momentarily.

161
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,060
Fanghua,

162
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,940
Miss Hashimoto,

163
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,101
shall we go?

164
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,400
- Mm.
- Let's go.

165
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,451
Miss Feng,

166
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,325
here we meet again.

167
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:16,336
Your family is on bad terms
with the Meng family.

168
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,235
Why did you come to Meng Xu'an's party?

169
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,950
I have something to tell Meng Xu'an.

170
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,350
Fanglin and Fanghua want to have fun.

171
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,550
By the way,

172
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,080
do you remember the Gold Kylin?

173
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,216
It belongs to the Meng family.

174
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,679
But my father

175
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,679
sold it.

176
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,640
I don't know what Meng Xu'an gets

177
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,625
on my father.

178
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,320
My father is desperate

179
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
to get back the Gold Kylin.

180
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,080
News that the Hashimoto family
owns the Gold Kylin

181
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
has got out.

182
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,719
Meng Xu'an is impatient

183
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,960
and he urges us to hurry.

184
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:47,159
The Hashimotos don't want to sell it?

185
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,239
Hashimoto Shozo doesn't want to sell it.

186
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
But someone else does.

187
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,359
Hashimoto Shiori

188
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,159
paid a private visit to my father,

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,719
saying when I broke off my engagement,

190
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,280
she would marry me

191
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,425
with the Gold Kylin as her dowry.

192
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:07,919
Miss Hashimoto is bold and careful.

193
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,050
It's very thoughtful of her.

194
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,025
She will do great things.

195
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,775
What's your plan?

196
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,000
Will you marry her?

197
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,516
What?

198
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,700
Do you care very much?

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,440
The Gold Kylin

200
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,559
isn't my concern.

201
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:25,425
Wait.

202
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Here's something serious.

203
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,599
I've got some information

204
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,200
about your family.

205
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,766
I had my men ask around in Guojia Town.

206
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,039
There,

207
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,039
they didn't find a Lady Bai

208
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,375
who got lost after leaving home.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
In the files of the police station,

210
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,559
no useful information was found, either.

211
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,000
But they found out something else.

212
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,735
Shortly after the tragedy,

213
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,119
a man reported to the police

214
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,400
that his little daughter fell into water

215
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,550
and her body was nowhere to be found.

216
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,359
The police

217
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,150
told him

218
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,600
no children's bodies had been found

219
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,520
and turned him away.

220
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,725
So, there's no more information.

221
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,919
Mother!

222
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,850
Shizhen,

223
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,039
don't be nervous.

224
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,885
He may not be your family.

225
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,880
I'll ask my men

226
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,000
to track it down.

227
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,799
Once they get any information,

228
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,040
they'll let me know immediately.

229
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,525
My mother was killed.

230
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,375
Who would know I fell into water
and got lost?

231
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
It's him.

232
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,640
The man who killed my mother.

233
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,694
He didn't find my body.

234
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,719
So, he was asking around.

235
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,875
He may have known

236
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,914
that I was rescued.

237
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,080
Don't worry.

238
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,061
It happened 20 years ago.

239
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,900
If he knew you were still alive,

240
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,391
he would have come to you.

241
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,955
Rest assured.

242
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:12,640
Let's stop the investigation.

243
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,799
If it continues,

244
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,525
I'm afraid that man will be alerted.

245
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,550
I'm using my men.

246
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,239
They only take orders from me.

247
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,475
Even my father can't order them about.

248
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,280
I'll ask them to keep a low profile.

249
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,080
You won't be involved.

250
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:31,235
Anyway,

251
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
I'll take care of everything.

252
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,321
What?

253
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:09,745
You miss me?

254
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,314
What can't you say in the hall?

255
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,510
The hall is crowded.

256
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:18,500
I have something to tell you.

257
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,719
Did...?

258
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,479
Did Rong Jiashang say anything?

259
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,600
It's not about him.

260
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:26,835
Do you remember

261
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,564
that I took some medicine

262
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,280
when we were in Hangzhou?

263
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:33,975
You asked me if I was sick.

264
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,840
Is it harmful

265
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,125
to your health?

266
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,890
I don't know.

267
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,940
But during our first sex
in the compartment of the train,

268
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,679
I didn't take the medicine.

269
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,919
Are you sure about the pregnancy?

270
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:57,760
I saw a Chinese doctor
and a western doctor.

271
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,975
They gave the same diagnosis.

272
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,479
I'm pregnant for nearly one month.

273
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,596
I got it on the train to Hangzhou.

274
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,919
Who else

275
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,760
knows it?

276
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,980
Rong Jiashang, I guess.

277
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,320
I felt unwell when I was in his home.

278
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,880
I think he figured it out.

279
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:24,400
Lanxin, you...

280
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,280
How could you...?

281
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,000
He knew about our relationship long ago.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,479
He doesn't care at all.

283
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,300
But...

284
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,559
On the surface,

285
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,679
I can't break with the Rong family now.

286
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,958
You know that.

287
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,960
You're scared?

288
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,164
You lost your place
in the Rong family long ago.

289
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,825
And you slept
with Rong Jiashang's fiancée.

290
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,640
What?

291
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,484
Still want to be Rong Dingkun's lackey?

292
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,295
If Rong Dingkun knows I betrayed him,

293
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,550
he wouldn't only beat me.

294
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,200
You...

295
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,121
You're the lady of the Du family.

296
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,000
He won't hurt you.

297
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,159
But in his eyes,

298
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,479
I'm nothing.

299
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,175
You're the father of my baby.

300
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,479
Xiucheng,

301
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,159
you once told me

302
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,000
that you wanted us to have a baby

303
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,799
and a bright future.

304
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,760
Did you say that

305
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,900
only to sleep with me?

306
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,500
I didn't.

307
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,080
It's just...

308
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:47,239
It's all very sudden.

309
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,500
I'm... I'm just not ready.

310
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,000
If you want to stop

311
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,925
and avoid bigger trouble,

312
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,675
I'll have an appointment
with the western doctor

313
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:15,960
for an abortion.

314
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,640
Lanxin,

315
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,599
I don't mean that.

316
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,100
We agreed from the begging

317
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,125
that we would break up
if we didn't get along.

318
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm not a woman

319
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,599
who can't live without a man.

320
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,325
I just thought

321
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,020
we could struggle for our future.

322
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,000
If you get cold feet,

323
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,950
just tell me in advance.

324
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,239
Du Lanxin,

325
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,840
what a loser you are!

326
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,239
Why did you fall for such a man?

327
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,075
I'll answer for it.

328
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,400
Lanxin,

329
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,435
give birth to the baby.

330
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,150
Let's be together

331
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,100
and bring him up.

332
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,155
I'll take you away as soon as I can.

I'm sorry.

Sorry to disturb you.

344
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:08,525
Who are you?

345
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,629
I'm a guest from downstairs.

346
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:13,965
I'm a friend of Mr. Meng's.

347
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:14,775
Come on in.

348
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:26,359
Did you

349
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,995
draw the paintings?

350
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,850
Mm.

351
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,775
You look quite familiar.

352
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,479
Don't be nervous.

353
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,398
Be seated, please.

354
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:40,425
Thank you.

355
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:48,014
You look beautiful.

356
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
Could you be my model?

357
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,250
Ah?

358
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,950
Could you, Miss?

359
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:56,656
Sure.

360
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,169
Don't move.

361
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,330
You must be familiar with my brother.

362
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:08,936
Brother?

363
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,726
Who's your brother?

364
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:12,686
Meng Xu'an.

365
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,470
I'm the ninth child of my family.

366
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,790
Oh, you're Xiaojiu?

367
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,056
Mr. Meng didn't tell me about me.

368
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,289
Sorry for not recognizing you.

369
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,239
Are you his girlfriend?

370
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,871
No.

371
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,550
I work for him.

372
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:29,446
He likes you, I guess.

373
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,570
You smell like him.

374
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,439
It's done.

375
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,500
Come and have a look.

376
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,000
All right.

377
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,670
Looks nice.

378
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,680
How long have you learned to paint?

379
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:37,400
Xiaojiu?

380
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,520
No.

381
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,359
Something's wrong.

382
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,125
What's wrong?

383
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,800
Something's wrong. Wrong!

384
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,839
Xiaojiu...

385
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,400
It's wrong.

386
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,400
It's wrong!

387
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,359
Xiaojiu?

388
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,650
Are you all right?

389
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:18,839
Did I scare you?

390
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:22,079
Don't be scared.

391
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,530
Help me up.

392
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,525
Shall I ask someone to take care of you?

393
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:29,884
I feel dizzy.

394
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,625
Help me up

395
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,319
and I won't tell my brother

396
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,959
you broke into my room.

397
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,410
Come on.

398
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,150
Help me up.

399
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,475
I'll tell you a story.

400
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,900
Xiaojiu!

401
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,119
- Let go of me!
- Xiaojiu.

402
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:00,550
Let go of me!

403
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,750
Ask the doctor to inject him.

404
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,599
- Go.
- Let go of me!

405
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:03,640
Let go of me!

406
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,520
Be gentle to him!

407
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,239
Let go of me!

408
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,280
Let go of me!

409
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,319
Mr. Meng, I...

410
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,239
Come with me.

411
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:14,719
Come.

412
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,839
I'm sorry, Mr. Meng.

413
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,850
I didn't mean that.

414
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,475
Xiaojiu said he wanted to portray me.

415
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:25,719
I didn't expect him to...

416
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,500
You know who he is?

418
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
I don't know.

419
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,239
He told me about his identity.

420
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,560
Mr. Meng,

421
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,160
I broke into that room accidentally.

422
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,880
I was even unaware of his existence.

423
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,300
But now you're aware.

424
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,359
Mr. Meng, don't worry.

425
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:43,446
I don't have a loose tongue.

426
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,275
I won't tell anyone about him.

427
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:46,599
It doesn't matter.

428
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,000
It won't be long

429
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,920
before everyone in Shanghai
knows about him.

430
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,280
I'll pretend I didn't see him.

431
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:01,319
Shizhen,

432
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,726
you're never a busybody.

433
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,525
It's good for you.

434
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:12,675
I know.

435
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:26,025
By the way,

436
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,359
Rong Jiashang just told me

437
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,000
that Hashimoto Shiori wanted

438
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,479
to replace Du Lanxin

439
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:34,000
and marry him with the Gold Kylin.

440
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:42,400
Your man is quite popular

441
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
with girls.

442
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,275
But he didn't tell you the whole story.

443
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,675
It can't be

444
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:51,400
simply a marriage

445
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
between him and a woman.

446
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:57,656
I'll keep an eye on it.

447
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,959
Take action accordingly.

448
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,479
By the way,

449
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:09,319
stay away from my brother.

450
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,640
Next time, he may hold something worse

451
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:15,074
than a painting knife.

452
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:18,560
Keep that in mind.

453
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:31,000
(Successful premiere
of Miss Xiao's new movie)

454
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:55,205
Fanglin?

455
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,970
Why are you here alone?

456
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,725
What happened?

457
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,625
Who bullied you?

458
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,920
If something upsets you,

459
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,869
tell me about it.

460
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,989
I'll keep the secret for you.

461
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:19,199
Miss Feng,

462
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,700
why does a woman

463
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
like someone else

464
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,875
even when she's engaged?

465
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:39,900
Tang Xianzu once said

466
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,475
that love once begun

467
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,350
would never end.

468
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,199
In terms of love,

469
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,950
we can't control ourselves.

470
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,725
That's why there are
so many sad love stories.

471
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,400
Maybe

472
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,625
it's the charm of love.

473
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,175
What is love?

474
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,400
Love...

475
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,575
It's luck, I guess.

476
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,375
In a man's life,

477
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:24,436
when he has the most heartfelt love,

478
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,560
even if it doesn't end up well,

479
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:33,165
it'll be his great luck.

480
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:37,719
Is it because of luck

481
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:43,296
that they did that kind of thing?

482
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,251
Perhaps.

483
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,625
Don't be sad.

484
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:53,880
In the future,

485
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,075
you'll have your own luck.

486
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,925
Something's wrong. Wrong!

487
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,959
Did I scare you?

488
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,925
Why does Xiaojiu look so familiar?

489
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,475
Have I met him before?

490
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:32,975
Or...

491
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,696
Does he look like someone?

492
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,600
According to the newspaper,

493
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,850
(Central China Antique Charity Auction)
On the 22nd of this month,

494
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,131
there'll be a charity auction
in the Museum.

495
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:46,585
Your good friend Miss Xiao
will cut the ribbon.

496
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,075
Is that so?

497
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:50,275
What kind of auction can be so grand?

498
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,910
It's a charity auction

499
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,430
held for soldiers on the frontline
and dependents of martyrs

500
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:56,400
by the cultural relics circle.

501
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,640
Many precious antiques
will be auctioned.

502
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,160
A mysterious antique won't be shown

503
00:29:02,225 --> 00:29:03,975
until the auction starts.

504
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,300
Rich men have got a lot of ideas.

505
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,350
Then again,

506
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:11,166
it's quite a big auction.

507
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,625
Many celebrities of cultural relics
will attend it.

508
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:15,876
Look.

509
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,750
Rong Dingkun will attend it, too.

510
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,750
All celebrities of Shanghai

511
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,959
will meet there, right?

512
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,239
Some Japanese will attend it, too.

513
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,399
Hashimoto... Hashimoto what...

514
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,990
Apparently,

515
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,500
they attend the auction
for our cultural relics.

516
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:35,705
Think about the Japanese.

517
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,611
They run factories everywhere

518
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:38,891
and exploit the workers.

519
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,336
On the black market,

520
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,450
they even buy a lot of antiques.

521
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
When I think

522
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,125
that foreigners will have
our national treasure,

523
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,881
I...

524
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,175
I feel so hurt.

525
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,500
Civilians like us
can't interfere with that.

526
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm warning you.

527
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,680
You can only talk like that at home.

528
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,675
Don't talk nonsense out of our home.

529
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,725
Do you hear me?

530
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:05,875
I get it.

531
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,000
Father,

532
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,849
show me the newspaper.

533
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,079
It won't be long

534
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,139
before everyone in Shanghai
knows about him.

535
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,550
Will Mr. Meng do something

536
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,340
at the auction?

537
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,050
It's a copy?

538
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:46,850
Yes.

539
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,400
Zhu Laojiu has great craftsmanship.

540
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:52,119
I checked it carefully.

541
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,411
There's no problem with it, I believe.

542
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:58,385
It's nearly a perfect copy.

543
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:01,685
But the Gold Kylin is the heirloom
of the Meng family.

544
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:04,026
You think Meng Xu'an can't recognize it?

545
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:05,094
Don't worry.

546
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:07,525
I won't give it to Meng Xu'an.

547
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,400
What will you do, then?

548
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,491
I'll have it sent

549
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:13,934
to the auction site

550
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,680
for an anonymous auction.

551
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,280
Auction?

552
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,319
By then, Meng Xu'an and Hashimoto Shozo

553
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,280
will be at the auction.

554
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:21,439
When they see the Gold Kylin

555
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,560
be auctioned,

556
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,280
how will they react?

557
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,560
There's fun to see.

558
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:31,204
By the way,

559
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,650
Father,

560
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,455
after the auction is over

561
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:36,655
and the Gold Kylin problem is solved,

562
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,100
I will request the Du family

563
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,560
to break off the engagement.

564
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,049
Be right there.

565
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:54,880
Oh?

566
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,479
Shizhen?

567
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,280
Baoli.

568
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,100
What brings you here?

569
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:57,825
Be seated.

570
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,675
All right.

571
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,450
- Baoli.
- Mm?

572
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,359
May I ask you for a favor?

573
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,560
My pleasure.

574
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,239
What is it?

575
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,719
In the newspaper,

576
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,499
I read about a charity auction next week

577
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:13,800
that you'll cut the ribbon for.

578
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,960
I want to attend it.

579
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,750
Could you take me there

580
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,199
as your assistant?

581
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,040
I know you don't like

582
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,100
balls or parties.

583
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,599
Otherwise,

584
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:24,599
I would have taken you

585
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,239
to such occasions many times.

586
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:27,900
Don't worry.

587
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,980
You're the best, Baoli.

588
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,920
You seldom

589
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,239
want to attend such an auction.

590
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,199
Mr. Meng?

591
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:37,050
By the way,

592
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,045
Baoli has to go with the leading actor.

593
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:42,425
Why don't you

594
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:43,706
be my companion?

595
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:46,119
Good idea.

596
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,425
- Baoli.
- Mm?

597
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,439
I'm a little bit hungry.

598
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,319
Fine.

599
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,850
Wait a minute.

600
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,875
In my home,

601
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:08,125
I said something to you.

602
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:09,396
Do you still remember?

603
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,599
Yes.

604
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,599
You asked me not to be smart.

605
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,119
Looks like you have no problem

606
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,119
with your listening or memory.

607
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:20,275
You just

608
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,426
don't like to follow my order.

609
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:27,104
I don't understand, Mr. Meng.

610
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:35,534
You came in the middle of the night,

611
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,434
asking Baoli for a favor

612
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,875
because you didn't want me to know it.

613
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:43,366
If I guess correctly,

614
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,556
it's not the antiques

615
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:47,975
at the auction

616
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,219
that you're interested in.

617
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,500
I'm just worried.

618
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:03,475
About what?

619
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:06,396
Rong Jiashang?

620
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,299
You fear that he'll get in trouble?

621
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,075
I hope he'll get in no trouble.

622
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,875
I don't think he'll feel grateful.

623
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
What?

624
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,360
Have you made a deal?

625
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,760
Yes.

626
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,330
I'll listen to Mr. Meng.

627
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,960
By the way,

628
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:46,719
I'm afraid it's too late

629
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,550
to make a dress for Shizhen.

630
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,560
Yesterday, I got a new dress.

631
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,439
By then,

632
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:51,719
Shizhen can try it on.

633
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:52,950
Thank you, Baoli.

634
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,600
Mr. Meng,

635
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,104
you'll take her to the ball.

636
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,044
You won't let her go
without a necklace, will you?

637
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,560
How about this?

638
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,080
Tomorrow,

639
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:05,080
I'll ask salesgirls of Printemps

640
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,320
to bring you some jewels

641
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:07,704
to pick from.

642
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,000
All right.

643
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,760
That's more like it.

644
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,825
Will you really take Taichi there?

645
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,600
Shiori reminded me.

646
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,679
At the auction,

647
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,479
celebrities of Shanghai will gather.

648
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,360
Young men and ladies

649
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,784
will attend it.

650
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:26,800
Taichi is

651
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,199
old enough to get married.

652
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:29,719
I'd like to take him there.

653
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,800
If he takes a fancy to a lady,

654
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,959
we can propose marriage to her family.

655
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,560
Yeah.

656
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,195
I think Taichi is getting better lately.

657
00:35:40,195 --> 00:35:41,525
He can go out for some fun.

658
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:43,879
You make sense,

659
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
but Taichi is sick.

660
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:48,125
He has to be taken care of.

661
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,719
Well...

662
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,080
Shall I go

663
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:57,935
and take care of him?

664
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:00,635
Don't worry.

665
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,275
I'll take good care of him.

666
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Good idea.

667
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,600
Go with us, then.

668
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:18,840
Shiori.

669
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,979
Is everything ready?

670
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:20,950
Rest assured, Shiori.

671
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,159
I'll get it done perfectly.

672
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,360
Hope so.

673
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,399
It concerns our future.

674
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,474
You'd better let nothing go wrong.

675
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:29,375
Fine, fine.

676
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,775
Stop worrying about it.

677
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,100
(Great World Museum)

678
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,280
Your daughters are pretty.

679
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,439
Coincidentally,

680
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,400
my son Taichi doesn't have a girl.

681
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,439
Shall we make them companions

682
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
in case they get bored?

683
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,225
Sounds good.

684
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:52,175
Fanglin, go ahead.

685
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,479
Young guys like you

686
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,078
should make more friends.

687
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,399
Nice to meet you, Miss Rong.

688
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,639
Nice to meet you.

689
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,000
Mr. Rong.

690
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,675
Mm?

691
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,250
Do you know there'll be
a mystery antique for today's auction?

692
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,399
I've heard about it.

693
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,199
They keep it very secret.

694
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,225
It must be a rare treasure.

695
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,479
If it's something precious,

696
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,639
hope you'll show mercy in the bidding.

697
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,069
You flatter me.

698
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,280
If you want something,

699
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,475
I won't make bids at all.

700
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,015
Mr. Meng,

701
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,816
I didn't expect you to come.

702
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,479
I only dabble

703
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,125
in antiques.

704
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,760
I just come to have a look

705
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,479
when I can also cheer

706
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,959
for soldiers on the frontline.

707
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,120
It's modest of you, Xu'an.

708
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Miss Feng,

709
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,781
nice to meet you again.

710
00:37:58,525 --> 00:37:59,366
Shiori,

711
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,120
who is this lady?

712
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
I neglected to introduce her.

713
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,399
Miss Feng used to be

714
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,040
Fanglin and Fanghua's governess.

715
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,520
We met a couple of times
in Rong's Residence.

716
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,240
Hello, Miss Feng.

717
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,040
Miss Feng.

718
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,919
You two look gorgeous.

719
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,280
So do you, Miss Feng.

720
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,400
You don't have a companion?

721
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,560
I do. Yuchi is my companion.

722
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,520
He's away because he met his teacher.

723
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,360
This is Mr. Hashimoto Taichi,
Fanglin's companion.

724
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,575
Nice to meet you.

725
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,239
Miss Feng,

726
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,800
did you come with Mr. Meng?

727
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm curious, too.

728
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,040
Miss Feng, when did you get so familiar

729
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,639
with Mr. Meng?

730
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,159
When my female friends

731
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,479
talked about today's auction,

732
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,040
they wondered

733
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,080
which lady would come with Mr. Meng.

734
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:46,520
I didn't expect it

735
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,439
to be Miss Feng.

736
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:52,439
Miss Feng is Xiao Baoli's friend.

737
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,025
She then got to know Mr. Meng.

738
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,280
Mr. Pei asked me

739
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,720
to take care of my junior.

740
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,311
You have no idea.

741
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,199
Before I studied in the United States,

742
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,150
I was a student of Mr. Pei's.

743
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,159
When I came back and visited him,

744
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,399
I got to know

745
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,980
Miss Feng was a student of his, too.

746
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,040
So,

747
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,425
she's my junior.

748
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
You two are quite destined to meet.

749
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,540
Jiashang,

750
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,959
Miss Feng is your governess.

751
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,399
In this case,

752
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,050
isn't Mr. Meng your senior uncle?

753
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,919
I'm an ignorant man.

754
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't dare

755
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,450

801
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,575
- Such a think necklace
- Do I hear a higher bid?

802
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,550
can be worth 1,000?

803
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,239
Do I hear a higher bid?

1,300 going once.

818
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,540
I'm not that narrow-minded.

00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,749
I just want to warn you.

820
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,605
