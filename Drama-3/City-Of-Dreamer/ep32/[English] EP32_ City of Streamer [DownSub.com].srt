=Episode 32=

3
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,519
Father.

4
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:45,715
Father?

5
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,825
There you are, Miss Feng.

6
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,759
Your brother called earlier.

7
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,080
Don't forget to call him back.

8
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,150
Sure. Thanks.

9
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,825
Shixun, it's me.

10
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,054
Did you just get off work?

11
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:33,135
My class finished hours ago.

12
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:34,575
The snow was too heavy,

13
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,575
so I went to the café to read.

14
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,694
How are Mother and Father?

15
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:41,200
They're good.

16
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,885
The new drug

17
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:45,004
is curing Father's lungs.

18
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:46,444
His fever is gone.

19
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,960
Now,

20
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,800
he and Mother would like to
go to the country retreat,

21
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,080
but I have concerns.

22
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:53,465
It's quiet and peaceful there

23
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
but too far away from the hospital.

24
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,325
If anything happens,

25
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:58,400
no one is there to help them, right?

26
00:03:58,475 --> 00:03:59,150
Yes.

27
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,669
I agree with you on that.

28
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,360
But with me here in Peking

29
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
and you at work most of the time,

30
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,725
they must feel lonely.

31
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:08,875
Shixun,

32
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,360
they'll feel better if you get married.

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,399
We're talking about their condition.

34
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,500
Don't make it about me.

35
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:17,239
By the way,

36
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,340
is it cold in Peking?

37
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,720
Do you feel uncomfortable there?

38
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,556
The stove inside

39
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,950
makes the room pretty warm.

40
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,649
Shixun,

41
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,775
I miss you all.

42
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:31,056
Me too.

43
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,279
I read in the paper

44
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,239
that Rong Dingkun is out of his coma,

45
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,480
but paralyzed.

46
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,440
That's karma.

47
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:42,079
But even so,

48
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,519
he has enough money

49
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,239
and people to attend to his needs.

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
He won't suffer at all.

51
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,880
For a proud

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,799
dictator like him,

53
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,514
paralysis

54
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,234
is probably worse than death.

55
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,450
As far as I know,

56
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,690
none of his women

57
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,399
truly cares about him.

58
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:01,295
They won't

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,760
fall over themselves like before

60
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,975
to impress a good-for-nothing.

61
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,406
The worst is yet to come.

62
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,925
Oh, Shizhen.

63
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,000
(New Head of the Rong Family
Rong Jiashang)

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,689
(Cut the Ribbon at Wenchunli Yesterday)
Are you still in touch

65
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,839
with Rong Jiashang?

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,839
Not anymore.

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,625
After I lied to him,

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,160
I just hoped he wouldn't get back at me.

69
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,320
Why do you think

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,839
I moved to Peking?

71
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:29,839
Why did you bring him up anyway?

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,400
Just checking.

73
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:34,000
Look, let me know

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,125
if he comes at you.

75
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,279
Even if he doesn't,

76
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,319
stay away from him.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,959
Don't mess with

78
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,271
those rich brats.

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,075
I know.

80
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,975
One more thing.

81
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,320
Tell Concubine Sun

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,650
that I ran into her sister here.

83
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:54,585
Shaoqing is doing fine.

84
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,730
She'll receive her letter soon.

85
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:57,600
Really?

86
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,220
Got it. That's great.

87
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,541
She's having a rough time

88
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,000
when her son

89
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,225
is having a fever.

90
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,650
She might be able to

91
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,625
take comfort from her sister's words.

92
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,250
I hope so.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Your name is put on the envelope.

94
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,625
Don't forget to pick it up for her.

95
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,880
Sure, I will.

96
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,559
And don't drain yourself, you know.

97
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,500
I won't. Take care of yourself, too.

98
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,000
Miss Feng,

99
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,230
your boyfriend is here.

100
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,519
He's waiting for you outside.

101
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,519
Thanks.

102
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,559
You're welcome.

103
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
Shizhen,

104
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,920
nice to

105
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,470
meet you again.

106
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,399
You didn't come all the way to the north

107
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,320
to buy me coffee, did you?

108
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,109
Just get to the point.

109
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,650
No need to waste

110
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:30,350
each other's time.

111
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,586
It's nothing important.

112
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,116
I saw Rong Jiashang

113
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,875
at the Mayor's ball yesterday.

114
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,861
Although his fiancée left him,

115
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,559
more girls were eager to

116
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,839
take her place.

117
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:49,239
Among them, Miss Hashimoto

118
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,998
is more likely to win.

119
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:55,600
As far as I know,

120
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,689
he's still in charge

121
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,300
despite the fact that

122
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,359
his father has woken up.

123
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,279
That scene you made

124
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,599
actually facilitated his succession.

125
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,596
You must

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,239
feel frustrated.

127
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,206
Rong Jiashang

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,100
has made you more attractive indeed.

129
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:22,950
Clearly, women can't grow

130
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,911
without men.

131
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,425
I suppose you didn't come all the way

132
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,720
from Shanghai

133
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
to pry into my love life.

134
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,320
Rong Jiashang said

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
he hadn't found your birth father,

136
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:40,119
didn't he?

137
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:43,320
And?

138
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:44,320
Do you believe him?

139
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,840
Since when did you become

140
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,359
so curious about my lineage, Mr. Meng?

141
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,501
Miss Hashimoto

142
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,265
has gone to great lengths

143
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:56,035
to win Rong Jiashang over.

144
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,520
She paid the newspaper

145
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,320
to disclose Miss Du's affair

146
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,995
and scared Yang Xiucheng away.

147
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:06,195
Didn't she play right into your hands

148
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,751
as you meant to recruit him long ago?

149
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,520
Now that he's down,

150
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,960
you can help him

151
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
get back on his feet.

152
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,176
As sophisticated

153
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,760
and selfish as he is,

154
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
he's a coward.

155
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,200
He'll yield to power.

156
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,359
You're right about him.

157
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,605
That man

158
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,215
isn't too stupid.

159
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,455
He gave up tons of information,

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
including your origins,

161
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,130
which is

162
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:36,754
shocking.

163
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,280
After Yang Xiucheng

164
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:41,675
hooked up with Miss Du,

165
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:43,650
he started to have people

166
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,119
watch Rong Jiashang's every move

167
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,636
in case he found out about the affair.

168
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:49,775
When Rong Jiashang had his assistant

169
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,095
dig into your background,

170
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,679
he found out about it

171
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,175
and followed his step.

172
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,330
They discovered a photo

173
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,700
and Yang Xiucheng made a copy of it.

174
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,450
When was this photo taken?

175
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,719
A long time ago.

176
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,404
The owner of the photo

177
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,000
is said to be your aunt,

178
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,725
which is confirmed by Rong Jiashang.

179
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,799
The couple in the photo is Rong Dingkun

180
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,919
and his wife

181
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
who gave birth

182
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,625
to you.

183
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,175
After she died

184
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:48,200
of illness,

185
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,125
Rong Dingkun married Ms. Tang

186
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,719
who was Rong Jiashang's mother.

187
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,915
If it's true that woman in the photo

188
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:54,450
was your birth mother,

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,799
you'd be

190
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,640
a Rong,

191
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,150
the eldest daughter

192
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,325
of Rong Dingkun.

193
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:02,300
Enough!

194
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,039
Mr. Meng,

195
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,250
everything you say without evidence,

196
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
solid evidence, is mere speculation.

197
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,081
You expect me to believe

198
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,925
that man is my father

199
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,024
based on a blurry photo

200
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,000
and a story

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,440
you made up?

202
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,570
I don't care how many wives
Rong Dingkun has had.

203
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,450
He cannot be my father.

204
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,359
You think you know everything,

205
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,466
but

206
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,640
there's still a lot about me

207
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,880
that you don't know.

208
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
What do you mean?

209
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,520
That the one

210
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,949
who tried to kill you and your mother

211
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,350
was your father Rong Dingkun?

212
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,400
Don't give me that look.

213
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:00,159
No one is stalking you.

214
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,200
It's just my theory

215
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:04,624
based on facts.

216
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,525
What else do you know?

217
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,080
The time of death

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,280
of Rong Dingkun's first wife

219
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,650
and children

220
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,719
matches that of your mother's death

221
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,125
and you

222
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,961
being adopted by the Fengs.

223
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,275
Young as you were,

224
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,039
I believe

225
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,775
you could remember things.

226
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,406
You knew the one after you
and your mother's life

227
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,225
was your father,

228
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,175
in this case, Rong Dingkun.

229
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,530
You're really selling it.

230
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,891
What about my missing younger brother?

231
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,714
Don't tell me that's Rong Jiashang.

232
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,280
His age doesn't match.

233
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,250
That said,

234
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,520
Rong Dingkun

235
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,640
cares a lot about his sons.

236
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,469
He might've kept that boy
somewhere else.

237
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,691
As convincing as it sounds,

238
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:06,815
it's still your assumption

239
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,575
unless Rong Dingkun says it's true.

240
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:10,200
No way are

241
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,215
Rong Jiashang and I related!

242
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,660
What else do you have to say?

243
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,799
I came

244
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,760
in person

245
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,799
to tell you this

246
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,195
not to mock you.

247
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,080
Rong Dingkun is not my father!

248
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,371
If you don't believe what I said,

249
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,830
let's go back to Shanghai

250
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,791
and ask your aunt

251
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,830
about the whole truth.

252
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,430
You sent me here,

253
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,400
and now, you want me back.

254
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,000
Meng Xu'an, what's your game?

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
There's none.

256
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,880
I just feel that

257
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,900
you deserve to know the truth.

258
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,025
What I deserve is peace.

259
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,460
I want no part in such a family drama.

260
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,870
We're of the same kind.

261
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,509
A peaceful life isn't for us.

262
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,316
An amazing journey is awaiting you.

263
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,000
Why not set out now?

264
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,599
I'm going back to Shanghai tomorrow.

265
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,230
If

266
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,831
you'd like to join me,

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,475
I'll be waiting for you at Peking Hotel.

268
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:33,850
(Dates Restaurant)

269
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,119
Hello, Mr. Rong.

270
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm Feng Shizhen,

271
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,479
your children's new governess.

272
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,930
Was it that I got my mother's look

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
that scared him?

274
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,911
No way.

275
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,239
He can't be my father.

276
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,415
Jiashang and I can't be siblings.

277
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,359
Trust me.

278
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:46,265
I'll find out the truth for you.

279
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:26,799
Hello.

280
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,460
Jiashang, it's me.

281
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,280
I know.

282
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,319
Do you miss me?

283
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,385
The temperature drops in Shanghai.

284
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,290
Keep yourself warm.

285
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:39,366
Don't catch a cold.

286
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,070
Got it.

287
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,245
Have you had breakfast?

288
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:45,475
Not yet.

289
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm going to get

290
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,640

291
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,380

292

topped with small shrimps.

293
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,520
My mouth is watering.

294
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,576
Too bad,

295
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,374
I can only get plain buns

296
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:04,040
with fermented soybean milk in Peking.

297
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,760
I'll bring those ingredients over

298
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,841

certain things don't add up.

that couple in the photo

350
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
is Rong Dingkun and my mother?

351
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,239
Even if they are,

352
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,825
how do we know

353
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:39,959
I'm their daughter?

354
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,240
Just based on this photo?

355
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,195
I'm not convinced at all.

356
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,920
Your aunt

357
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,525
seems to have other evidence.

358
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,479
We don't know if it's authentic

359
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,119
until we see her in person.

360
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,599
Rong Jiashang has had his man

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,279
bring her to Shanghai

362
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,969

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,660

364
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,610
She had boarded the train

365
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,490
when I got Yang Xiucheng's message.

366
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,820
You must've also sent your people

367
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,840
to let us meet.

368
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,490
I sent Wen,

369
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
but I'm not sure if he can

370
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,281
beat Rong Jiashang's man to it.

371
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,040
How ironic!

372
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,439
When Rong Dingkun had them

373
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,159
set Wenchunli on fire,

374
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:29,265
he didn't know he could've hurt

376
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
Was that why you picked me

377
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,750
instead of others?

378
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm no prophet.

379
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,625

your connection with the Rongs.

381
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,109
You're right about one thing, though.

382
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:49,205
I picked you

383
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,110
because you're one of a kind.

384
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,650
Why me?

385
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,691
Why you?

386
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:58,119
Because you have certain things

387
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,575
I need.

388
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,370
Such as your perseverance,

389
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,400
persistence,

390
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,041
intelligence

391
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,069
and impressive educational attainments.

392
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,959
All to serve your own purpose.

393
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:23,854
You're young

394
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,719
and held back

395
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,050
by your so-called love.

396
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,535
I was disappointed in you,

397
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,040
but now, I can understand it.

398
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,400
We all

399
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:38,914
have our weaknesses,

400
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,105
but you have to believe me

401
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,064
that you can go a long way,

402
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,759
much longer

403
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,666
than others, no doubt.

404
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,350
Forgive me if I overstep my bounds.

405
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:05,296
Rong Jiashang is young,

406
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,350
capable

407
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,250
but

408
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,225
also boyish,

409
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,029
naive

410
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:13,050
and lost.

411
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,825
Why do you adore him?

412
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,834
Is it because you're a teacher

413
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:21,235
that you instinctively grow fond

414
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,425
of a man who needs your guidance?

415
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,900
It just happens

416
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,895
before you know it.

417
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,175
I guess

418
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,145
love is unpredictable.

419
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:41,986
Is that it?

420
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,970
Maybe

421
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,140
I'm the one that's naive and lost

422
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:52,134
in love.

423
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,770
You're right

424
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,600
about Rong Jiashang.

425
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,335
It's true

426
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,106
that he's immature

427
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,955
and less perfect

428
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,246
than you,

429
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:07,395
but

430
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,570
he's growing

431
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,395
and so am I.

432
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,050
I think

433
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,725
I'll enjoy this process.

434
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,264
No matter how short it is,

435
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:25,466
I won't regret

436
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:29,084
having it.

437
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,025
You'll see my point

438
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:39,424
once you're in love.

439
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:42,520
Whatever your type or preference is,

440
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,880
it doesn't matter

441
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:45,895
when you find the right one.

442
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,201
Whether she's pretty or not,

443
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,800
in your eyes,

444
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,131
she's perfect

445
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,035
and the best woman in the world.

446
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,475
Perhaps

447
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,320
I've found her.

448
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,439
Freeze! Don't move!

449
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,125
Freeze!

450
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:04,850
Stop!

451
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:08,680
Stop!

452
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,125
- Go get him!
- Stop!

453
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,934
Two men outside asked to see you.

454
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,225
(Shanghai Railway Station)

455
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,491
I had the kitchen

456
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,770
make your favorite.

457
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:20,275
What's wrong?

458
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:21,405
Poor appetite?

459
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:28,635
Your parents and your brother

460
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,059
don't know you're back.

461
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,139
You can stay here.

462
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,799
Thanks.

463
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,064
Your aunt...

464
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:45,396
Wen is with her now

465
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,105
and they're on the way back.

466
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:48,880
You'll see her

467
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,000
when they arrive tomorrow.

468
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,150
About that woman,

469
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,650
my aunt,

470
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,149
can we trust her?

471
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:01,359
Rong Jiashang has confirmed

472
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:03,605
her identity.

473
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:04,984
Otherwise,

474
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,920
she wouldn't have the old photo.

475
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:08,714
Ms. Qian

476
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,359
and your mother

477
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,240
are half-sisters.

478
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,046
The plague

479
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,441
striking Darong

480
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,286
and Guojia Towns

481
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:19,400
almost emptied the Rong

482
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,049
and Qian households.

483
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,330
Your mother was a Qian.

484
00:28:25,575 --> 00:28:26,974
Her sister survived

485
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,526
because she was

486
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:29,950
married to someone in Guangzhou.

487
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,725
Only she can tell us

488
00:28:32,725 --> 00:28:33,800
what really happened.

489
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,850
What if

490
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,040
she's not my aunt?

491
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,384
And

492
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,700
she can tell lies, too.

493
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,860
No way,

494
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,680
for one,

495
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,735
your mother died in Bailiu Town.

496
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,440
Only she died

497
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,880
during that time frame.

498
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,350
And two,

499
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,264
there was only one woman called Bai

500
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,345
who married a Rong in Guojia Town

501
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:57,479
and

502
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,750
had a son and a daughter.

503
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,079
Three,

504
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,079
the time

505
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,775
and place of her death

506
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:02,935
are a match.

507
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,035
If it weren't you,

508
00:29:06,475 --> 00:29:08,156
I couldn't think of anyone else.

509
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:11,155
Is there other evidence?

510
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,749
According to Ms. Qian,

511
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,790
when her sister's daughter was born,

512
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:19,250
Rong Dingkun

513
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,411
sent over a silver longevity lock.

514
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,850
Speaking of which,

515
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:24,805
was it with you

516
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,650
when you were adopted

517
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,029
by your foster parents?

518
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:33,294
I had nothing

519
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,515
other than my clothes.

520
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:40,295
There's something else.

521
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:43,354
Rong Dingkun fell from a tree

522
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,289
and broke his leg

523
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,500
when he was little.

524
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,880
The broken bone wasn't set properly

525
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,801
but he could still walk

526
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,250
despite the dull pain

527
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,775
on rainy days.

528
00:29:57,575 --> 00:29:59,050
I saw him

529
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,100
walking fast.

530
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,125
His legs seemed fine.

531
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:08,280
It's not like I could check them.

532
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,950
You couldn't

533
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,100
but the doctor could.

534
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,880
When he got shot,

535
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,859
they gave him

536
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,391
a full body checkup in the hospital.

537
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:18,204
The results can tell us

538
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,551
if he has a broken leg.

539
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,316
That's clever.

540
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,880
That's enough for today.

541
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,000
We'll know more

542
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,241
after meeting with your aunt tomorrow.

543
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,839
Here you are.

544
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,045
Taste the crabs.

545
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:40,314
Peking Hotel called and said

546
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:41,520
they'd get

547
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,825
fresh hairy crabs in two days.

548
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,199
I've asked them to keep some for you.

549
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,160
Don't forget to have them.

550
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:49,124
Thanks.

551
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,044
There you are finally.

552
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:07,006
What took you so long?

553
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,425
Sorry, sir. We got ambushed.

554
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,500
Please give us another chance.

555
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:12,804
We'll get her back.

556
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,275
You got ambushed?

557
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,925
Find her or don't bother to come back.

558
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:23,585
Get out!

559
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:24,965
- Yes.
- Yes, Mr. Jiashang.

560
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,580
Miss Feng,

561
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,779
you're back.

562
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:50,539
Hello, Wen.

563
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:53,740
It's been a while.

564
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:05,775
Sister?

565
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:07,900
You…?

566
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,199
Ma'am,

567
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,550
look carefully.

568
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,451
Better not mistake her

569
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:13,931
as someone else.

570
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,825
You have my sister's face,

571
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,430
her husband's eyebrows,

572
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,690
and those eyes…

573
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,811
They're her eyes!

574
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:25,725
The longevity lock,

575
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,490
are you still wearing it?

576
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:29,085
The longevity lock?

577
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:31,505
I don't have one.

578
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,830
Then...

579
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,301
Then...

580
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,630
May I see

581
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:37,285
the back of your head?

582
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:39,775
Sure.

583
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,411
You've got a red mole.

584
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,120
It's you!

585
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,870
You're Daniu!

586
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:55,034
You're really her!

587
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:57,734
How do you know I have a mole there?

588
00:32:57,925 --> 00:32:59,650
Of course I do!

589
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,324
When you were born,

590
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,175
I was still at home.

591
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:05,500
I changed your diapers

592
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,375
every day.

593
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,679
Oh my,

594
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:12,135
you're still alive!

595
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:15,479
Thank heavens!

596
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,640
God bless you!

597
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,425
Alright.

598
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:19,704
Calm down.

599
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:20,903
We can sit down and talk.

600
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:22,250
Have a seat.

601
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,250
Sure. Thanks.

602
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:28,646
Please.

603
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,650
Ma'am,

604
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,910
just breathe.

605
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,150
Take your time.

606
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,600
Tell this young lady everything

607
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,615
about her family.

608
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:41,200
Your mother's name is Bai Yuzhen

609
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,985
who married a Rong,

610
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,040
Rong Dingkun,

611
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:48,715
the only heir of
Mr. Rong's fourth son in Guojia Town.

612
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,950
Granddaughters of the Rongs'

613
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,275
all had a "Fang" in their names.

614
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,884
You were the fourth of them all

615
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:57,126
but the firstborn of your father,

616
00:33:57,425 --> 00:33:59,760
so your name was Fangzhen.

617
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,700
"Zhen" is the one with

618
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:02,300
the character "Mu" (wood) on the side.

619
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
Fangzhen, call him Father.

620
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:08,195
Father.

621
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,650
What's your name, sweetie?

622
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,040
Do you remember?

623
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,320
Fangzhen.

624
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,320
Fangzhen...

625
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,040
Your father left home

626
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:23,816
to do business in Shanghai

627
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,919
before you were born.

628
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,560
He was too busy

629
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
to come back every year.

630
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:33,785
When your mother was pregnant again,

631
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,689
your grandmother gave her a hard time,

632
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,200
so she came back to live with us.

633
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,440
Later, she gave birth to your brother.

634
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,725
Her husband was thrilled

635
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,735
and sent back a message

636
00:34:44,825 --> 00:34:47,475
that he made a killing in Shanghai

637
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:49,457
and he'd have you three over

638
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,100
to live with him.

639
00:34:52,075 --> 00:34:55,120
At that time, I had moved to Guangzhou

640
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,159
with my husband.

641
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,611
Your mother was so excited

642
00:34:58,611 --> 00:34:59,900
and shared the news with me in a letter.

643
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:02,345
My poor sister!

644
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:05,495
She died of illness

645
00:35:05,495 --> 00:35:07,735
on the way to Shanghai

646
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,700
with you and your brother.

647
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,840
I heard

648
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:15,246
when her husband came back to bury you,

649
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,766
he carried the virus
to the Rongs by accident

650
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,100
which killed them all.

651
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:24,906
That was a heavy blow to him.

652
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,625
He sold all their property there

653
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,800
and returned to Shanghai

654
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,159
without coming back again.

655
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,511
Fangzhen,

656
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,199
how...

657
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:36,050
How did you survive?

658
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:39,124
Have you reunited with your father?

659
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:40,874
Where's your brother?

660
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:43,924
We got separated.

661
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:47,615
My mother didn't die of illness.

662
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,660
She was killed

663
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:55,705
by someone halfway.

664
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,919
How come?

665
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,386
I was too young

666
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,065
to get a good look at the killer's face.

667
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:06,275
He stabbed me

668
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,750
and I fell into the water

669
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,930
and floated

670
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,909
downstream

671
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:15,775
until my foster parents found me.

672
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,280
They followed the trace

673
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:22,516
to look for my mother and brother.

674
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,370
But by the time they got there,

675
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:31,006
all they saw

676
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,975
was her body.

677
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,521
There was no sign of my brother.

678
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,551
It was them

679
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,561
who paid for

680
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:42,725
her funeral.

681
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:44,560
So,

682
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,520
you have her ashes?

683
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:49,679
But...

684
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,599
But the neighbors said

685
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,925
your father buried all your ashes

686
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:57,335
into the family graveyard.

687
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,850
They could be someone else's.

688
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,475
Aunt,

689
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,959
is this your photo?

690
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,040
Yes,

691
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,344
but the Rongs

692
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,080
grabbed the original one.

693
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,644
Can you tell me more about my father?

694
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:29,055
What kind of person he was?

695
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:36,915
He was a good man.

696
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,920
Everyone in the village said

697
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:40,655
your mother got lucky.

698
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,861
He was good-looking,

699
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,101
reliable and rich.

700
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,371
He never talked to

701
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:50,475
other women,

702
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:52,485
but worked really hard.

703
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:55,246
Seeing that the land was low-yield,

704
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,194
he went to work for others

705
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,294
and started his own business

706
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,325
from scratch.

707
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,870
He was a good husband and father, too,

708
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,810
who had people bring back

709
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:09,760
foreign perfume,

710
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,841
lipsticks and fabrics.

711
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:15,639
He loved you all.

712
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,280
After his business took off,

713
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,159
he rebuilt the Rongs' ancestral hall.

714
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,159
Whenever your grandmother
talked about him,

715
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,439
she'd tell everyone

716
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:27,400
what a lucky star Ho was

717
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:29,846
and he was bound to succeed.

718
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,560
Then his business did
grow bigger and bigger.

719
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,360
Your grandmother

720
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,680
was right.

721
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:38,336
Unfortunately,

722
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,540
she didn't get to see that.

723
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,600
Who's "Ho"?

724
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,110
That's your father.

725
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:46,045
"Ho" is his pet name.

726
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,320
"Ho"?

727
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,075
That name sounds familiar.

728
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,415
"Ho"...

729
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,390
Relax.

730
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,439
Don't push yourself

731
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,300
too hard.

732
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,381
One step at a time.

733
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:05,935
Ma'am,

734
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:06,835
how about this?

735
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:08,105
You can stay here

736
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,454
these days.

737
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,765
Let us know

738
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,846
if you think of anything else.

739
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:12,565
Alright?

740
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,840
Sure.

741
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,040
I will.

742
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,919
No problem.

743
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:17,639
Wen,

744
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,050
lead her to the room.

745
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,080
You can go with him.

746
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,040
Thanks.

747
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:44,439
Mr. Jiashang,

748
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,236
your father was craving opium

749
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,199
and almost trashed the room.

750
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,650
Your sister put the prescribed drugs

751
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,450
into his water and fed it to him

752
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:56,944
which put him to sleep.

753
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:58,344
You may leave.

754
00:39:58,425 --> 00:39:59,266
Yes.

755
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,439
Father,

756
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,325
how do you feel?

757
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:26,325
What would you like to eat?

758
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,959
Go away.

759
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,625
I called Dr. Robert

760
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:30,504
in America.

761
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,951
He's interested in your case.

762
00:40:33,425 --> 00:40:34,466
I'll escort you to New York

763
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,025
if you want to go.

764
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,899
I can have your wife

765
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:38,875
or any concubine you like

766
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,954
keep you company.

767
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,600
If the operation goes well,

768
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:44,246
you'll be able to walk Fanghua

769
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:46,005
down the aisle at her wedding.

770
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,300
Jiashang,

771
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,900
you know what the biggest irony is?

772
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,120
You didn't want to

773
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,840
take over our family business at first.

774
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,639
Now that I have,

775
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,380
I'll do what needs to be done.

776
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,980
By that,

777
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:10,550
you mean to destroy

778
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,150
this family?

779
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:22,144
It's the opposite.

780
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,600
I'm trying to save it.

781
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:27,399
Father,

782
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:30,475
you established this empire,

783
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,800
but it doesn't belong to you alone.

784
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,424
The shareholders and co-founders

785
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,525
won't allow you
to ruin everything we have

786
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:39,040
for your personal grudge
against Meng Xu'an.

787
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,504
Neither will I allow you

788
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,800
to ruin my brother and sisters' future

789
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,239
for your own agenda.

790
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,780
Father,

791
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:49,866
when you start to do more

792
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,325
for others

793
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:52,825
and our family than yourself,

794
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,719
you can judge me.

795
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,560
Without me,

796
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,510
you wouldn't have anything.

797
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,101
I've done so much for this family,

798
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:08,595
for you all.

799
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:12,894
Do you know what all that cost me?

800
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:14,466
What about you?

801
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,310
What have you done for us?

802
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,716
You don't get to judge me

803
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:23,355
or call me selfish!

804
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:25,425
You do everything

805
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:27,094
for yourself.

806
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,295
To you, women are toys.

807
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:30,400
Children can be traded

808
00:42:30,656 --> 00:42:32,136
for marriage alliance.

809
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,850
After you woke up

810
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,100
and heard what happened to Fanghua,

811
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,820
you kept calling her cheap.

812
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,871
Then when Wu Yunchi agreed to marry her,

813
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:40,434
you called her a good girl.

814
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:43,159
Father,

815
00:42:44,025 --> 00:42:45,520
do you have any idea

816
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,625
how much you've hurt

817
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,675
Fanghua and Fanglin?

818
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:53,386
What's the point of

819
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,000
raising those girls

820
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:59,040
