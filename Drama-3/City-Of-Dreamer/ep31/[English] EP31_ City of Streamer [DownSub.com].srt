00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:54,894
Shizhen,

4
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,659
how will I ever let you know?

5
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:01,775
I'll keep the secret

6
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,935
forever and ever.

7
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,119
The new teacher Miss Feng is awesome.

8
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,400
She easily enlightened me

9
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,279
on math problems I couldn't solve.

10
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,720
Hope I can be as great as her someday.

11
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,825
She's such a good and beautiful woman.

12
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:50,050
What kind of man on earth

13
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,320
can be good enough for her?

14
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,500
Stop guessing.

15
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,340
She's already spoken for.

16
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,559
Look over there.

17
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,789
Miss Feng, someone is waiting
for you downstairs.

18
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,679
According to students,

19
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,160
a handsome rich man is chasing you.

20
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,375
That's him?

21
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,376
He looks handsome and amiable,

22
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,839
unlike other rich young men.

23
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
Shizhen, you have to hustle.

24
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,250
When are you going to get married?

25
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:27,445
Get married?

26
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,511
I haven't decided yet.

27
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,259
Seriously? What a good man he is!

28
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,860
He's one in a million.

29
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,350
You can't even find a better man

30
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,575
in romantic novels.

31
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,335
What a pity!

32
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,920
We're already lucky to be together.

33
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,959
There's no pity.

34
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,839
Life is short for women.

35
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,640
You should think for yourself.

36
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:46,515
Life is short.

37
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,679
We'll enjoy every day we spend together.

38
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:49,760
I'll take my leave.

39
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,425
See you.

40
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:51,150
All right.

41
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,040
Why did you suddenly come?

42
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,519
I missed you

43
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,000
and I came to pick you up.

44
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:13,595
I got paid today.

45
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,950
Shall I invite you

46
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,679
to watch Shang Xiaoyun's new opera?

47
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,750
As soon as you have money,
you're trying to support a man?

48
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,375
But considering my figure
and appearance,

49
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,020
I deserve a higher price.

50
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,720
In my heart,

51
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,150
you're very valuable.

52
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,519
Even all salaries of my life

53
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,799
can't be enough for you.

54
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,580
But I need the money
for another purpose.

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,880
You're rich, Mr. Jiashang.

56
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,799
You can wait, can't you?

57
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,500
What do you need the money for?

58
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,089
I want to buy a house.

59
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,040
Are you going to stay in Peking?

60
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,150
Mm.

61
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:58,895
If it's because of Meng Xu'an,

62
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:00,236
I can solve the problem.

63
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,861
When I'm around,
you don't need to be scared.

64
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,425
It's not all about him.

65
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:05,935
Actually,

66
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,060
I've always wanted to settle down
in a place

67
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,100
and think carefully

68
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,650
about our future.

69
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,285
What will our future hold?

70
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,320
It depends on how you treat me.

71
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:24,314
Let's go.

72
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:25,475
Mm.

73
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,559
I asked you not to buy them,
but you insisted.

74
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,200
Why did you buy so many things?

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,519
I can't use them up.

76
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,900
I don't care.

77
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,559
What other girls have,

78
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,775
my girl must have it.

79
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,399
What other girls don't have,

80
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,239
my girl must have it, too.

81
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,550
What if you spoil me?

82
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,471
My pleasure.

83
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,799
- Rock Paper Scissors.
- Rock Paper Scissors.

84
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,279
- Rock Paper Scissors.
- Rock Paper Scissors.

85
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,550
We won.

86
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,500
I won.

87
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,731
Wait for me, brothers!

88
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,999
What happened?

89
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,205
Don't cry.

90
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:00,875
Are you hurt? Stand up.

91
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,700
Let me check.

92
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,286
Where did you hurt?

93
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:04,885
Your knees?

94
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:05,600
Mm.

95
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:07,244
Your brothers are just ahead.

96
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,165
Come on. Go play with them.

97
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:09,725
Mm.

98
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:11,200
They're waiting for you there.
Stop crying.

99
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,819
She looks so lovely when she stumbles.

100
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,274
You like children?

101
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:21,300
Mm.

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,579
Of course I do.

103
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,301
Or why would I be a teacher?

104
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,809
Look at their eyes.

105
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,270
Pure

106
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:29,805
and vigorous.

107
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:33,359
What's wrong?

108
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,175
Miss,

109
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,799
my brothers refused to play with me.

110
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:37,920
How come?

111
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,239
Why don't they play
with such a lovely girl?

112
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,875
Go. Let me take you there.

113
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,519
Mm.

114
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,079
Let's go.

115
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,679
Be careful. Mind the snow.

116
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,475
Come on.

117
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,920
Rock Paper Scissors.

118
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
- Rock Paper Scissors.
- Brothers!

119
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,675
- Rock Paper Scissors.
- Rock Paper Scissors.

120
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,359
You play the eagle.

121
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,440
All right. All right. Come on.

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,200
Come on.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,200
Come over.

124
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:07,850
You come this way.

125
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,839
You can't catch me!

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Come and catch us.

127
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,959
Hold tight.

128
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,179
Here. Here.

129
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:34,825
Hello?

130
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,650
Hello? Jiashang.

131
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,425
Father woke up.

132
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,119
Just now,

133
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,525
he asked where you were.

134
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,359
I said you were in Peking
for some business.

135
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,775
He woke up?

136
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:50,475
How's he doing now?

137
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:53,440
He's clear-headed.

138
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,989
But he's unconscious
from the waist down.

139
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:58,225
The doctor is checking on him.

140
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,951
It's preliminarily estimated

141
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,340
that the bullet hurt his spine.

142
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,314
I'm afraid he can't accept such a fact.

143
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,400
You're right.

144
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,239
After Father knew that,
he became furious.

145
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,200
He smashed all the infusion bottles.

146
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,701
The doctor had to ask the nurse
to inject him

147
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,325
so that he would calm down.

148
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,541
What about the others?

149
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,500
Mother and Aunts are
accompanying him in the room.

150
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:26,320
Fanghua was informed, too.

151
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,679
She said she would come back
as soon as possible.

152
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,479
Yunchi is keeping her company.

153
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,200
Where's Uncle Zhao?

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,775
Ah?

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,850
Why do you ask about him?

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,599
When Father woke up,

157
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,050
didn't he come?

158
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,804
Oh. He's also here.

159
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,569
Do you want to talk to him?

160
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,599
No.

161
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:48,719
Tell Father

162
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,159
that I'll be back tomorrow morning.

163
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,039
All right.

164
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,599
Jiashang,

165
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,554
what plan do you have

166
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,520
for you and Miss Feng?

167
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,350
It's none of your business.

168
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,640
Do me a favor.

169
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,239
Don't bring her up in front of Father.

170
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:07,500
All right.

171
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,000
I won't.

172
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,300
Look at here, please.

173
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,175
Get closer.

174
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,159
Have a bigger smile.

175
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,119
All right. Get ready.

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,520

You're back.

205
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:12,915
Your father has been asking about you
since he woke up.

206
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,799
He's living in the West Hall.

207
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,359
Go to see him.

208
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:33,960
Mr. Jiashang.

209
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,559
Father.

210
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,760
Don't be angry.

211
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,840
Or it'll harm your health.

212
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,280
What do you want to do, then?

213
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,150
If you don't want
to take care of me, get out!

214
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,070
Get out!

215
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,719
Out!

216
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
Jiashang?

217
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,590
Jiashang.

218
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,239
It's all right.

219
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:13,816
I'm back.

220
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,700
I'll take care of everything.

221
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,599
Father became irascible
after he woke up.

222
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,799
Mother doesn't want to take care of him.

223
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:22,479
Jiashang,

224
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,211
be very careful.

225
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,440
Don't worry.

226
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,100
I'm going upstairs.

227
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:49,919
Father.

228
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,679
You've found the way home?

229
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,725
Did that woman

230
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,825
finally allow you to come back?

231
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,679
How did you know?

232
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,225
Don't think I knew nothing

233
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:06,100
just because I was in a coma.

234
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,775
You loser.

235
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,239
You broke off your engagement
to Du Lanxin

236
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,119
and lost the paid bride price!

237
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,080
Now everyone in Shanghai is

238
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,760
laughing at our family!

239
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,925
It's my engagement.

240
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,955
I'll handle it in my way.

241
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,760
It's a family engagement!

242
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,840
What makes you think you'll handle it?

243
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,400
Look how poorly

244
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,640
you're running the company.

245
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,719
Meng Xu'an is at the door,

246
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:35,440
and you?

247
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,275
You shirk and step back.

248
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,444
Here comes something interesting.

249
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,039
Meng Xu'an

250
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,725
has got my half-brother.

251
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,799
If I killed Meng Xu'an,

252
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,880
should I kill my brother, too?

253
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,239
If I killed him,

254
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,119
how would I explain

255
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,200
after you woke up?

256
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,080
What are you talking about?

257
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,919
You don't know about it?

258
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,000
Meng Xu'an's sister

259
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
gave birth to your son

260
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,650
and he was raised in the Meng family.

261
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
He's 17 years old now.

262
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,159
What?

263
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,239
Qingzhi...

264
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,359
She had a son for me?

265
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:21,400
I met him at the auction.

266
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,559
He looked weak.

267
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,320
But apparently,

268
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,725
he's my biological brother.

269
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:31,775
Father,

270
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,239
when you meet him,

271
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,950
will you be happy?

272
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,440
Meng Xu'an has

273
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,465
brought my son up.

274
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,525
What on earth is he up to?

275
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,650
What else do you expect?

276
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,159
He'll certainly kill us

277
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,525
and make his nephew

278
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,520
the master of our family.

279
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,479
Fortunately,

280
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,919
Shizhen saved me.

281
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,475
You should be grateful to her.

282
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,325
Without her,

283
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,440
I wouldn't be standing here.

284
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,040
We owe this to her.

285
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,520
That woman

286
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,920
worked for Meng Xu'an, didn't she?

287
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,920
I told you that she was fishy.

288
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,920
I kept warning you.

289
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,800
But you were enchanted by her
again and again!

290
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,680
Such a kindhearted man like you

291
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,239
doesn't deserve to be my son!

292
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,160
Right.

293
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,855
I'm indeed weaker than you.

294
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,625
I'm not merciless enough

295
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,560
to kill my own brother.

296
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,719
Shut up!

297
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,719
Give my seal back to me.

298
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,319
From this day on,

299
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,665
don't interfere
with any family business.

300
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,680
Go continue your education.

301
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,119
Give my seal back to me.

302
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Give it back to me!

303
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,485
I've got an idea.

304
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,760
Father, you're in poor health.

305
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,079
You'd better rest for recuperation.

306
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,959
And I'll take care of the company.

307
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
With the help of friends,

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,359
I've found the best neurologist.

309
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,450
I hear he's in New York.

310
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,575
I've contacted him.

311
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,680
I'll take you to see him personally.

312
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
What do you think?

313
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,075
You...

314
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:19,875
You...

315
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,800
You heartless creature!

316
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:27,655
Are you going to grab power from me?

317
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,319
In less than one month,

318
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,839
you cut the apron strings

319
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,800
and tried to be independent?

320
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,575
What do you think you are?

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,839
You're nothing,

322
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,560
but a childish puppy!

323
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
After assisting me for a couple of days,

324
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,599
you want to take the wheel?

325
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,280
I'm... I'm not dead yet!

326
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,050
It's not your place to be the master!

327
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,975
Give my seal back to me.

328
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,425
Give it back...

329
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:54,079
Give it

330
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,439
back to me.

331
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,975
Give my seal back to me!

332
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:59,439
Give my seal back to me!

333
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,400
Give it back to me!

334
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,950
My... my seal...

335
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,640
Scamp!

336
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,025
I don't want you.

337
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,439
I don't want you.

338
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,680
You're just like your mother.

339
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,359
Stupid

340
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,839
and cowardly.

341
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,479
I would rather give my family property

342
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,525
to Qingzhi's son

343
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,000
than you.

344
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,319
Get out of here.

345
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,920
Get out of here!

346
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,199
Father, you must be tired.

347
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:43,000
Have a good rest.

348
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,199
Mr. Jiashang.

349
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,800
Give him an injection.

350
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

351
00:19:59,250 --> 00:19:59,950
Come on.

352
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,155
You heartless creature.

353
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,760
Don't touch me.

354
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,975
Don't touch me.

355
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,325
Don't touch me.

356
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:07,439
Don't touch me.

357
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,400
It'll be done soon.

358
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,525
Just a second.

359
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,280
Our family and the Meng family are
well-matched in strength.

360
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,200
Neither of us can

361
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,879
annex the other at one stroke.

362
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,560
If we keep fighting each other,

363
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,834
we'll both lose

364
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,410
and the third party will benefit.

365
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,119
Father,

366
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,920
you don't own the Rong family alone.

367
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,000
I can't let you

368
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,599
ruin our family

369
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,000
for your personal grudge.

370
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,319
Fanghua has paid a terrible price

371
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,560
for the mistake you made.

372
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,479
I must protect other innocent people.

373
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:16,900
Father,

374
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,839
you know it.

375
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,160
I'm not interested

376
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,560
in Rong's businesses.

377
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,880
But from now on,

378
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,710
I'll take the wheel for the Rong family.

379
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
This is the best choice for the family.

380
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:43,680
Father,

381
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,500
your time has gone.

382
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,025
Take a good rest.

383
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,480
Jiashang?

384
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,109
Did Father beat you?

385
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,040
He's being unreasonable.

386
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,839
Whenever he feels unsatisfied,
he maltreats us,

387
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,975
saying that we try to hurt him.

388
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,681
Father was just back from the hospital

389
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:46,145
and he's paralyzed.

390
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,330
I'm afraid he can't face up to it.

391
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,239
He can do nothing
but vent his anger on others.

392
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't take it personally.

393
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,950
Father used to be spirited.

394
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,599
He always strode

395
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,040
and was full of beans.

396
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,640
Jiashang,

397
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,450
when do you think Father can recover?

398
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,640
Considering the current
medical technology,

399
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,625
we can't find a cure for him.

400
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,959
I just hope

401
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,675
he can accept the reality soon.

402
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,725
Mm.

403
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:20,800
Don't worry.

404
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,961
I'll take care of everything.

405
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,475
Mother.

406
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,599
Jiashang,

407
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,560
how was your trip?

408
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,040
Not bad.

409
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,750
Uncle Zhao, did you come
to visit my father?

410
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,800
After taking the medicine,
he fell asleep.

411
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,479
Ma'am said you were back

412
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,959
and she invited me to dinner.

413
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,900
Besides,

414
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,875
several documents

415
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,554
need your father's signature and seal.

416
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm keeping the seal.

417
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,359
Since my father was injured,

418
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,760
he's been mentally unstable.

419
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,125
Considering he's irascible,

420
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,075
he can't handle any business.

421
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,786
I'll manage the company

422
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,760
on his behalf.

423
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,625
You don't mind, do you?

424
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm loyal to your family,

425
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,920
whether alive or dead.

426
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,000
If you need anything,

427
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,079
I'm at your service.

428
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,439
Only when you
shoulder the main responsibility

429
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,119
can your father recuperate
without concern,

430
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,150
right?

431
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,100
I'm glad to hear that.

432
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:33,225
Mm.

433
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,950
Let's have a talk in the study.

434
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,631
All right.

435
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,725
Ma'am.

436
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:39,400
Mm?

437
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:41,665
Excuse me.

438
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:42,493
Mm.

439
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,640
Mother, are you all right?

440
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,520
One more thing.

441
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,599
The war is critical in the southwest.

442
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,560
Local crimes are rampant.

443
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,250
Our goods from the south

444
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,199
(Contract for Market Storehouse)
have been robbed twice.

445
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,500
(Party A: Rong Jiashang, Party B: Huatai Company)
Commanders are too busy with wars

446
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,000
to attend to us.

447
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,640
Suspend the transport, then.

448
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,680
It's the end of the year.

449
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,640
Let our men have some days off.

450
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,275
How's it going with the Meng family?

451
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,760
Nothing big has happened.

452
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,560
They just keep an eye on us
with open hostility.

453
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,325
Avoid head-on confrontations
as far as we can.

454
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,920
They're evenly matched with us.

455
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,425
Once we get into a big fight,

456
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,425
we'll both suffer.

457
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,900
Then others will benefit.

458
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,560
But your father can't let it go.

459
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,839
We mustn't harm the family interests

460
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,959
because of his personal grudge.

461
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,760
Besides, you developed

462
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,560
our subordinates.

463
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,839
If they're killed in such conflicts,

464
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,275
won't you feel sorry?

465
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,519
Uncle Zhao.

466
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:02,550
Mm?

467
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm young

468
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,959
and not very experienced.

469
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,950
Now, I can take the position

470
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,375
simply because

471
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,896
I'm Rong Dingkun's son.

472
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,280
I know.

473
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,475
Some seniors in the company
don't obey me.

474
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,825
I manage to hold on to my position

475
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,475
because you support me.

476
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,325
I'll keep in mind

477
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,375
how you've helped me.

478
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,550
Don't say that.

479
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:28,506
Since you worked in the company,

480
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,119
you've handled

481
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:31,675
every case properly.

482
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,920
To be honest,

483
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,560
times have changed.

484
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,880
We established the company
with your father.

485
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,000
However,

486
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:41,479
we still depend on young men like you

487
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,425
to make it prosper.

488
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,431
Uncle Zhao, you're reading my mind.

489
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,439
To tell you the truth,

490
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,925
I've always wanted to discuss something

491
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,075
with a senior.

492
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,411
I'm all ears.

493
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,171
Some of Rong's businesses
should be rearranged.

494
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,359
Some businesses are murderous.

495
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,040
They make evil money.

496
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,719
They should be

497
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,825
cut down,

498
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,675
then closed down.

499
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,521
Uncle Zhao,

500
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,119
what do you think?

501
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:21,504
What businesses are you talking about?

502
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,591
Opium.

503
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,104
Opium?

504
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,121
I know.

505
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,760
Selling opium

506
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,300
laid a solid foundation

507
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,520
and has financially supported
our company for years.

508
00:27:41,675 --> 00:27:43,239
But it's not a long-term business.

509
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,920
And it's too wicked

510
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,400
and guilty.

511
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,401
If we don't rearrange our businesses,

512
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,239
we will be bound

513
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,000
and forever stuck in illegal businesses.

514
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,560
Once we stop selling opium,

515
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,479
we'll suffer heavy losses.

516
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,640
The profits are considerable.

517
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,599
How can we stop it just as we wish?

518
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,000
Haven't we done

519
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,520
enough wicked things?

520
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,640
My father is paralyzed now.

521
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,250
No offense,

522
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,119
but he deserves it.

523
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,880
I want to do this

524
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,889
so that I can perform good deeds

525
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:19,236
for my father

526
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,359
and my family.

527
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,319
It's easy to stop selling opium.

528
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,079
But then how do we support our men?

529
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,520
It's not easy

530
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,599
to disband men in this industry.

531
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,119
Where there's a will, there is a way.

532
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,520
Even the best of friends must part.

533
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,000
Uncle Zhao, you assisted my father.

534
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,049
You made the greatest contributions.

535
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,199
I won't treat you shabbily.

536
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,160
Thank you for taking care of my family

537
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,079
when I was away.

538
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,514
I heard that Ma'am was unwell.

539
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,719
But when I saw her today,
she looked good.

540
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,040
You and your sisters call me Uncle Zhao.

541
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,079
Then we're a family.

542
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,079
We should take care

543
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,479
of each other.

544
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:17,450
Cheers.

545
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:32,479
Shiori,

546
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
news just came

547
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,430
that Mr. Rong woke up.

548
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,560
In recent days,

549
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,580
routes of Rong Company
have had repeated failures.

550
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
A few days ago,
one of their batches was reported

551
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,640
and detained.

552
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,479
Mr. Rong has woken up,

553
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,280
but Rong Jiashang still takes the wheel.

554
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:54,719
What's your point?

555
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,575
Shiori,

556
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,280
this is vital to taking Rong Jiashang.

557
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,680
If you marry him,

558
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,640
you'll be the mistress
of the Rong family.

559
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,319
Our brother just died
and we're still in mourning.

560
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,400
If I offer to marry him,

561
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,000
even Father will not approve.

562
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,079
Besides, do you think

563
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,959
Rong Dingkun can still force his son?

564
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,889
We have to

565
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,119
come up with a more careful plan.

566
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,199
Send someone to spy on the Rong family.

567
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,239
Let me know if there's any news.

568
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,680
Rong Jiashang

569
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,599
will be mine.

570
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,479
He can't get away.

571
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Sir, here's your newspaper.

572
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:59,450
(Rong Dingkun of Rong Company
Woke Up Last Week)

573
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:09,450
Rong Jiashang has been back for days.

574
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,700
What has he done?

575
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,359
Mr. Meng,

576
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,800
Zhao Hua'an sold opium secretly.

577
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,319
When Rong Jiashang knew that,

578
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,160
he used an excuse

579
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,920
to have fired
Zhao Hua'an's subordinates.

580
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,439
He even gave a pay raise
to regular employees.

581
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,760
No legal businesses are neglected

582
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,550
and directors have no reason
to complain.

583
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,900
They hate Rong Jiashang,
but don't dare to say so.

584
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,571
He punished Zhao Hua'an as a warning

585
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,000
and won popular support.

586
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,000
Rong Jiashang

587
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,119
can be capable.

588
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,520
I also got wind

589
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,280
that Rong Jiashang issued a new order.

590
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,160
All businesses of Rong Company

591
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
can't be implemented

592
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,400
without his review, signature or seal.

593
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,599
In this way,

594
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,479
their channel of opium smuggling
will be cut off.

595
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,560
We can hardly get anything on them.

596
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,959
What about Rong Dingkun?

597
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,319
He's been staying in his residence
without coming out even once.

598
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,319
The Rong family is offering
five times the salary

599
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,239
to recruit a nurse.

600
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,160
Rong Dingkun

601
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,880
never dreamed

602
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:12,479
that he would be paralyzed at this age

603
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,400
and that his son grabbed his power.

604
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,359
It's not enough. I want more.

605
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,599
I'll make him watch it

606
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,560
when his family is broken up and ruined.

607
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,319
One more thing, Mr. Meng.

608
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,199
We've figured out

609
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,590
where Miss Feng is living.

610
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,959
Do you want the address…?

611
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,199
No.

612
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:40,475
As long as I know she's all right,

613
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,641
I'm contented.

614
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,199
Come on in.

615
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,839
Mr. Meng, you've got a visitor.

616
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,160
He asked to meet you alone.

617
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:55,119
Meet me alone? Who's he?

618
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,079
He didn't leave a name, but a note.

619
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,359
He said you would know
upon seeing it.

620
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:09,700
(I know all Rong Dingkun's secrets.)

621
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,920
Get him in.

622
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,000
You may go.

623
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

624
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,959
Mr. Meng.

625
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,359
Mr. Yang, long time no see.

626
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:50,515
Mr. Meng,

627
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,400
I'm sorry to disturb you.

628
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,439
I had no choice

629
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,750
but to come and beg you.

630
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,359
Please save me.

631
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,146
I heard about your affair with Miss Du.

632
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:11,345
I also heard

633
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:13,235
that you decamped
with a lot of Rong Dingkun's money.

634
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,600
What?

635
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:16,275
Trying to come back now?

636
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,560
Decamped?

637
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,320
How could I?

638
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,280
Mr. Meng, you know very well

639
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,076
what kind of man Rong Dingkun is.

640
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,919
He has woken up.

641
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
He'll certainly hunt me down.

642
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,950
Throughout Shanghai,

643
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,345
Zhao Hua'an's men are everywhere.

644
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,520
Even the Du family won't let me go.

645
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,300
I'm...

646
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,520
I'm driven to the wall.

647
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:43,959
I know you're looking for me, too.

648
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,679
I indeed know
many of Rong Dingkun's secrets.

649
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,925
As long as you keep me alive,

650
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,439
I will

651
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,320
tell you without reserve.

652
00:34:58,225 --> 00:35:00,786
I have to see how valuable

653
00:35:00,786 --> 00:35:02,305
the secrets can be.

654
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,150
Come and have a look.

655
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,120
How much is this?

656
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,520
Have a browse first.

657
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,560
If you want any,

658
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,450
you can bargain.

659
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,200
Come and have a look.

660
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,800
What about this? How much is it?

661
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,760
You have good taste.

662
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,225
- This one looks good, too.
- This is a new product.

663
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,679
Shizhen?

664
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,000
I can give you a discount.

665
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,175
Shaoqing?

666
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:36,800
Shizhen.

667
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:39,239
Come and have a look.

668
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,080
I should say thank you to you.

669
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,700
Without your help,

670
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,080
I would still be living

671
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,439
a hell-like life.

672
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,439
It's you

673
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,450
who gave me a new life.

674
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,679
I didn't expect

675
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,359
to see you again.

676
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,875
How was your life in Japan?

677
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,600
I got married.

678
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,675
I'm back in Peking with my husband

679
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:01,560
because he is on a business trip.

680
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,425
He's a diplomat.

681
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,919
Why are you in Peking?

682
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,080
I resigned from the Rong family.

683
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,199
Now I'm a teacher in a local school.

684
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,350
Were you implicated in my case?

685
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,639
After you left,

686
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,719
a lot more things happened
in the Rong family.

687
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,800
Fanglin and Fanghua were admitted
to McTyeire School for Girls.

688
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,080
I completed my duty

689
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,479
as their governess.

690
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,975
Then I got the job in Peking.

691
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,600
Do you know

692
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,999
how my sister is doing?

693
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,325
I was so keen to run away

694
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,275
that I didn't consider
how she would end up.

695
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,760
Shortly after you left,

696
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,919
she gave birth to a son.

697
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,500
I guess

698
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,340
the Rong family will be nice to her.

699
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,830
She indeed has a son.

700
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,439
That's what she was expecting.

701
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,375
Later,

702
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:04,320
she straightened out her ideas.

703
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:06,000
She managed to understand you.

704
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,425
She also thought it was good for you

705
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,199
to run away.

706
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,879
She asked me

707
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,200
to tell you

708
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,100
that she missed you a lot

709
00:37:16,475 --> 00:37:18,075
if I could meet you again.

710
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,399
If possible,

711
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,479
I'll visit her in Shanghai.

712
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,600
Let me give you an address.

713
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,879
Her son is in poor health

714
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,320
and he's staying in the hospital
where my brother works.

715
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,959
If you miss your sister,

716
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,320
you can write a letter

717
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,600
to the address of the hospital.

718
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,300
All right.

719
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,575
My brother will give the letter to her.

720
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,600
Shaoqing,

721
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:52,360
take care.

722
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:53,775
So do you.

723
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,800
Father,

724
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,960
time for lunch.

725
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,280
You unfilial son!

726
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,875
How do you have the nerve to come?

727
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,360
I... I spent most of my life

728
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,560
establishing the family business.

729
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,000
This is what I earned!

730
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
But you ruined it all!

731
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,825
I don't want the meal.

732
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:24,159
I want opium.

733
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:25,959
I want...

734
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,719
I want... I want opium!

735
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:31,760
According to the doctor,

736
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,600
if your waist hurts,

737
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,239
you can have some opium.

738
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
It hurts.

739
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,439
It... It hurts.

740
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,900
It...

741
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,600
Give it to me.

742
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,239
Give it to me.

743
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,760
It...

744
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,900
Give it to me.

745
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,500
Give it to me. Give it to me.

746
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,320
Give it to me. Give it to me.

747
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,200
Father,

748
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,959
did you have a wife and children

749
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,479
before you married my mother?

750
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,840
Who are you?

751
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,075
I'm your son,

752
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:28,375
Rong Jiashang.

753
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,600
Jiashang?

754
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,050
You've grown up.

755
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,360
Father.

756
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,760
Before me,

757
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,850
did you have a son and a daughter?

758
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,325
No.

759
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
You're my only son

760
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,725
of your generation.

761
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:02,475
When you were born,

762
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,775
you weighted 3.4kg.

763
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:12,050
You indeed tortured your mother.

764
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,875
Your crying

765
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,575
nearly raised the roof.

766
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,560
You indeed

767
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:31,396
made me proud.

768
00:40:58,875 --> 00:40:59,595
Father,

769
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,364
I heard

770
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,919
that you had another family.

771
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,439
Who told you that?

772
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,029
Ma'am and Uncle Zhao.

773
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,370
They also said

774
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,700
that they died of illness.

775
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:27,000
No.

776
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,971
They were my brother's family.

777
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,679
Why did you never mention

778
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,225
that I had an uncle?

779
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:40,100
Why do you ask?

780
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,030
I'm just curious.

781
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,150
You said I was your first son.

782
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,750
Do I have an elder sister, then?

783
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,679
No.

784
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,360
You're the only son I have.

785
00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:22,126
You're my only son.

786
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,025
Father.

787
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,239
