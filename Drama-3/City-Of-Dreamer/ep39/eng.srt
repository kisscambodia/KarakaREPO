00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 39=

3
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,400
Mr. Rong,

4
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,120
you'd better not interfere
with this case.

5
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,450
The arrest last night was usual.

6
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,990
Those who were arrested

7
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,611
can hardly be released.

8
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,820
I understand.

9
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:59,319
I won't put you through this.

10
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,260
Now that he can't be released,

11
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,725
could you do me another favor?

12
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:04,400
At least let us know where he's locked

13
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,199
so that we can have him taken care of.

14
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:07,455
Fine, then.

15
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:08,614
I'll ask about it for you.

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,419
What's your friend's name?

17
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:11,455
Feng.

18
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,550
Feng Shixun.

19
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,145
Shi for world

20
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,200
and Xun for merit.

21
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,350
By the way,

22
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,425
he's a doctor at Red House Hospital.

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,380
As far as I know,

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,110
those who were arrested last night

25
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,575
turned out to be revolutionaries.

26
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:27,919
Revolutionaries?

27
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,520
There must be something wrong.

28
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,575
He would never be a revolutionary.

29
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,700
He's a rigorous
and self-disciplined man

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,845
who works very hard.

31
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:36,966
You must have got him wrong.

32
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,065
He has parents and a sister.

33
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:39,600
Why would he be a revolutionary?

34
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:40,880
Mr. Rong,

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,880
it's hard to tell.

36
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:44,950
I asked about him for you.

37
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:46,426
Those who were arrested last night

38
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:48,187
turned out to be famous cadres.

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,641
Considering your friend
was arrested last night,

40
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:52,322
he couldn't be a common doctor.

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,675
At present,

42
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:56,645
they're all locked in Tilanqiao Prison.

43
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,300
I couldn't interfere with that place.

44
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,295
I know it's difficult.

45
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,275
But please take the trouble

46
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,650
to find some helpers for me.

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,039
Fine.

48
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,250
All right.

49
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,919
Thank you.

50
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,825
Mr. Jiashang,

51
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:16,075
I heard you say

52
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,314
that Dr. Feng was arrested.

53
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:18,675
What happened?

54
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,240
You heard it right.

55
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,100
Dr. Feng is in trouble.

56
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,479
He was arrested as a revolutionary.

57
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,565
Considering what you just said,

58
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:30,700
is it huge trouble?

59
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,524
We can't save him

60
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,163
even with the power of the Rong family?

61
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,475
The situation isn't clear yet.

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,925
But it's indeed tricky.

63
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,175
No way.

64
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:57,754
How's that possible?

65
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,575
Lady, there you are.

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,399
What's up?

67
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,804
Master woke up.

68
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,410
Ms. Chen went out early this morning
to get some medicine for him.

69
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:12,135
Ma'am asked you
to serve Master with breakfast.

70
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:13,960
You know his temper.

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,619
If he waits for a long time...

72
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,175
I'm on it.

73
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,896
If you don't want to serve me,

74
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,015
you can leave.

75
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:57,000
Look at you.

76
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,189
Are you pulling a long face

77
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,775
to disgust me?

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,721
I'm not dead yet.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,401
What?

80
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:10,125
You want to mourn for me already?

81
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:12,200
No.

82
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,850
I just...

83
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,800
I just heard about something.

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,475
Have you heard about it, Master?

85
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,480
Last night,

86
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,675
the police arrested
revolutionaries everywhere,

87
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,025
saying they would execute reactionaries.

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,300
Why is a woman like you

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,831
so interested in politics?

90
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:37,839
What?

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Your friend was arrested?

92
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,760
No.

93
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,520
Miss Feng's brother was arrested.

94
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,000
Dr. Feng, I mean.

95
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,070
He was arrested.

96
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:55,975
Why does his arrest

97
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:58,144
make you worried?

98
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm not worried.

99
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,880
I'm just curious.

100
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,575
I heard Mr. Jiashang make several calls.

101
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,850
Is it

102
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,480
very dangerous?

103
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:13,959
It depends.

104
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,516
It depends on how it'll be handled.

105
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,119
Particularly, this is an unusual case.

106
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,675
Whether there's evidence,

107
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,250
whether he's guilty,

108
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,475
and what crime he has done

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,000
will simply be decided by the judge.

110
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,399
With powerful helpers,

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,325
it can be solved easily.

112
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,100
But without them,

113
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
even money won't help.

114
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,990
What?

115
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,911
Will my ungrateful son

116
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:45,679
use our own money

117
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,079
to save

118
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,700
that sinister woman's brother?

119
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,025
Are you saying

120
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,100
that he can be saved?

121
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:04,266
Looks like you care a lot

122
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,519
about Dr. Feng.

123
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,959
Dr. Feng

124
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,559
saved my son Jiakang and me.

125
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,760
Though Jiakang was too unlucky

126
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,225
to survive,

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,761
he managed to live for a few months

128
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,950
with Dr. Feng's help.

129
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,364
I'm grateful to Dr. Feng.

130
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,175
I certainly care about his life.

131
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,075
Jiakang?

132
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
Like I said,

133
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:32,375
it is possible

134
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,025
to save him.

135
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,239
With powerful helpers,
there won't be any problem.

136
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,250
However,

137
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,385
Jiashang is

138
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,079
too inexperienced.

139
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:45,775
He can't use such helpers.

140
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,279
Master,

141
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,825
will you help Mr. Jiashang?

142
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,000
He hasn't begged me.

143
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,799
That...

144
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,300
That woman...

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,850
Feng Shizhen

146
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,079
utterly discredited my family.

147
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,320
Why would I help

148
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,720
her brother?

149
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,025
If she kneels

150
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,880
and begs me,

151
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:20,085
I'll think about it.

152
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:32,175
(Tilanqiao Prison)

153
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:40,239
Open the gate.

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,329
Thank you.

155
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:42,009
No problem.

156
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,675
You got the chance for her.

157
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,959
Why didn't you tell her?

158
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,121
I don't want her to have
any psychological burdens.

159
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,131
My family owes it to her.

160
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:03,475
All right. Thank you.

161
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,799
What's your name?

162
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,775
Feng Shizhen.

163
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,280
Fine.

164
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
This way.

165
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:16,646
Her brother's case is tough.

166
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,535
Even Chief Liu fails to help.

167
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,321
Jiashang,

168
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,080
do you know Li Dezheng?

169
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,880
He's the director
of Shanghai Police Headquarters.

170
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,599
It was his men

171
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,840
who arrested those people.

172
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,640
Before he took office,

173
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,719
he was on good terms with your father.

174
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,599
How about begging your father?

175
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,400
My father?

176
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,119
He wants Shizhen's family to suffer.

177
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,119
He won't help.

178
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,559
What do we do, then?

179
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,719
I can't think of a solution.

180
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,760
Every man has his weakness.

181
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,679
We can hit on what he likes.

182
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,320
Are you saying...?

183
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,640
Right.

184
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,750
Let's go.

185
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,679
Open the gate.

186
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:05,625
Go.

187
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,159
Feng Shixun!

188
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,760
You've got a visitor!

189
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,800
Thank you, sir.

190
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,001
Fine. I'll go have a cigarette.

191
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,975
Be quick.

192
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:28,725
All right.

193
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:39,250
Shixun,

194
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,725
did they beat you?

195
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,525
If I weren't beaten,

196
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,760
how could I prove

197
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,125
I was once in prison?

198
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,850
I'm lucky enough.

199
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,280
You managed to come in

200
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,025
and bring me a suit.

201
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,325
Shizhen,

202
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,100
how's everything going out there?

203
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,075
Everything is in a mess.

204
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,225
Insurgents are being hunted
throughout the city.

205
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,760
Everyone is disquieted.

206
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:16,960
What about Father and Mother?

207
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,250
Are they all right?

208
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,750
Yes.

209
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,325
I've kept it from them.

210
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,275
I told them

211
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,300
you were taken here for investigation

212
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,485
and you could go home after it.

213
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,775
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,200
It's my fault that...

215
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
We're a family.

216
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,525
Don't say that.

217
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Shixun,

218
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,450
I don't understand politics.

219
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,559
But I know

220
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,225
this is your political ideal.

221
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,325
You haven't done anything wrong.

222
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:11,975
For my problem,

223
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,799
you must have suffered these days.

224
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I had thought

225
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
I could get you out earlier.

226
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
But the situation is tense.

227
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,700
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for days.

228
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,679
Yesterday, some comrades were taken out

229
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,300
and didn't come back.

230
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,841
I'm afraid they were killed secretly.

231
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,325
Shizhen,

232
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,919
if anything happens to me,

233
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,840
tell Father and Mother

234
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:55,175
- that I...
- Shixun,

235
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,756
you won't.

236
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,554
You won't die.

237
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,175
You're the backbone of our family.

238
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:07,799
You won't be dead.

239
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,675
Don't overthink.

240
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,075
I'll find a solution as soon as I can.

241
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,550
Fine.

242
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,275
All right. It's about time.

243
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,475
You should leave.

244
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,425
Go back home.

245
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,039
Do protect yourself.

246
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,200
Wait for me.

247
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:51,366
Shizhen,

248
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,795
when I'm away,

249
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,119
take good care of Father and Mother.

250
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,225
Don't let anyone else get hurt again.

251
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,450
Rest assured, Shixun.

252
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:28,550
(Tilanqiao Prison)

253
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,000
Come on. Get in.

254
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
You saw him?

255
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,300
Why didn't you

256
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,239
ask me for help?

257
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,125
This is my family business.

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,359
I shouldn't bother you.

259
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,359
Don't treat me as a stranger.

260
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,700
Speaking of that,

261
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,101
you once reminded me.

262
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,925
I was just too careless.

263
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,185
Your brother is an adult.

264
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,640
He should take responsibility
for his actions.

265
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,775
And you know him very well.

266
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,954
I'm afraid you couldn't persuade him.

267
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:45,554
Don't worry.

268
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:48,025
Their target is Zhang Guoquan,

269
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,159
instead of your brother.

270
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,559
Besides, your brother isn't
deeply involved.

271
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,825
He won't be killed for the moment.

272
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,559
Let's spend more bribe money

273
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,840
and he won't suffer much

274
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,125
during the interrogation.

275
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,375
Mr. Meng,

276
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,950
I want to borrow some money from you.

277
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,425
I'll pay the normal interest.

278
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,750
Is it necessary between us?

279
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,625
We should clear up the accounts.

280
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:13,000
After Shixun is released,

281
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,280
I'll pay you back with the interest.

282
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,239
Shizhen,

283
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,100
I didn't mean to tell you this.

284
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,559
But whatever...

285
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,239
Today, you managed to see your brother

286
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,239
because

287
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,049
someone helped behind you.

288
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:36,286
It was

289
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,925
Rong Jiashang.

290
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,799
Will you be softhearted?

291
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,055
Your concern is misplaced, Mr. Meng.

292
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,880
His help is one thing.

293
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,599
The blood feud
between Qin Shuigen and me

294
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,920
can be another.

295
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,130
They're irrelevant.

296
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,700
As for the money,

297
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:20,295
get it from Meng Hai.

298
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,950
I'll tell him about it.

299
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,959
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

300
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,880
Look at Ms. Chen.

301
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
She gets such high pay,

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
but she runs out almost every day,

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,479
saying she's sent by Master.

304
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,975
Who knows if it's true?

305
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,359
Where's today's newspaper?

306
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,160
Master will read it after breakfast.

307
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,800
Don't worry. I remember that.

308
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,350
(Last night, 25 revolutionaries
were executed.)

309
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,900
(Arrested revolutionaries are:
Feng Shixun...)

310
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,880
Lady,

311
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,175
the breakfast is ready.

312
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,450
Lady, the breakfast...

313
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,040
Ungrateful son!

314
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,400
How dare you use our own money

315
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,150
to save that woman's brother?

316
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,800
They should have died in prison.

317
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,925
I should have killed them personally!

318
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,500
Father,

319
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,760
such money

320
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,975
doesn't belong to our family!

321
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,225
What?

322
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,200
You'll bribe Director Li with the money?

323
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,350
You know what?

324
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,050
He won't help you.

325
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,199
You think after you grabbed power,

326
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,719
you could manage everything?

327
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,640
You're making our family decline.

328
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,199
He won't do you the favor!

329
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,719
Go tell Feng Shizhen

330
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,475
to pick up her brother's body!

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,550
Go pick up his body!

332
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,285
You heard us?

333
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,839
Master, if you don't help,

334
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,199
will Dr. Feng be executed?

335
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,959
You heard us, didn't you?

336
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,880
That's why Jiashang is

337
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,725
so exasperated.

338
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,575
Master,

339
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,730
couldn't you do him the favor?

340
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,000
For the sake

341
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,700
that Dr. Feng saved Jiakang and me,

342
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,250
you would do a good deed for Jiakang

343
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,300
so that he may live happily
in his next life.

344
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,560
Besides,

345
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,175
Mr. Jiashang is your own son.

346
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,800
He's so young and childish

347
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,625
that he quarrels with you for a woman.

348
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,160
As his father,

349
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,719
if you let go of it and help him,

350
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:48,950
he'll regret

351
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,375
and feel guilty.

352
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,000
Then you can

353
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,350
ask him to let you leave the room.

354
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,300
You can even get back to the company.

355
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,280
You don't want Feng Shizhen
to be your daughter-in-law.

356
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,275
I'll think of a way

357
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,225
to send her away.

358
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,025
Women know how to deal with other women.

359
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
You'll deal with Feng Shizhen for me?

360
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,900
However,

361
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,239
if Jiashang knows that,

362
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,750
he'll fall out with you.

363
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,319
I'm a concubine.

364
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:30,950
Whether I'm on good terms
with Mr. Jiashang

365
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,759
doesn't matter.

366
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm your concubine, anyway.

367
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,280
At the worst, I'll leave the family.

368
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:54,445
To save Feng Shixun,

369
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,560
you will sacrifice so much?

370
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,525
Fine.

371
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,375
I'll help you.

372
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,500
So,

373
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,075
you agreed to help?

374
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:15,050
I'll go get Mr. Jiashang to you.

375
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,640
I can save Feng Shixun
simply by making a call.

376
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,400
But,

377
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,719
you should do

378
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,100
what you promised me.

379
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,640
We need a careful plan

380
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,675
to deal with Feng Shizhen.

381
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,600
It can't be done in a day or two.

382
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:36,599
So...

383
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,800
I can't wait for your plan.

384
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,250
This isn't hard.

385
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,525
Go to the West Hall.

386
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,175
In the third cell
of the innermost bookcase

387
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:50,096
of my study,

388
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,150
there's a gun.

389
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,450
What do you want me to do?

390
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,760
Don't you understand?

391
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,000
Kill Feng Shizhen with the gun.

392
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,825
As soon as I'm informed
of her death,

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,800
I'll save Feng Shixun.

394
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,119
You want me

395
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,839
to kill Miss Feng?

396
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,400
Why?

397
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,369
Why?

398
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,719
Because she wants to ruin my family.

399
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,239
If she reveals what I did,

400
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,300
our family will be utterly discredited.

401
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,280
After you kill her,

402
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,710
you can stop Jiashang
from doing stupid things.

403
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,225
After you kill her,

404
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,225
you can defend our family

405
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,475
and do good deeds for Jiakang.

406
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,390
Isn't that good?

407
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,150
We don't need to kill her, anyway.

408
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,640
Let me talk with her

409
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,875
and make her cave in.

410
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,479
Talk with her?

411
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,800
If talking could solve the problem,

412
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,760
I wouldn't have asked you to kill her.

413
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:01,680
Jiashang just told me

414
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,239
that Feng Shixun would be executed

415
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,839
this noon.

416
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,479
You have less than four hours.

417
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,800
Hurry up.

418
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,550
Otherwise, today will be the day

419
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,715
he dies.

420
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,225
This noon?

421
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,575
Either Feng Shixun
or Feng Shizhen can live.

422
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,985
Rong Jiashang picked Feng Shizhen.

423
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,054
What about you?

424
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,290
Who will you pick?

425
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,225
Master,

426
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,745
I beg you.

427
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,640
I haven't even killed a fish
since I was born.

428
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,800
How could I kill a woman?

429
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,239
It's a quarter past eight.

430
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,719
Feng Shixun has little time

431
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,959
to live in this world.

432
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
What?

433
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,475
Do you still need to think about it?

434
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,600
How about this?

435
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,961
Let me promise you something more.

436
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,550
After you kill Feng Shizhen,

437
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:17,025
I'll divorce you.

438
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,100
What did you say?

439
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,675
Don't think I don't know
what you want.

440
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,920
You wanted to leave the family long ago

441
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,920
and go far away
with your beloved man, right?

442
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,599
Kill Feng Shizhen

443
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,150
and I'll let you go.

444
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,800
You can go to Feng Shixun for shelter

445
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,560
with your private savings

446
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
and spend the rest of your life

447
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,079
comforting him,

448
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,520
asking him to forgive you,

449
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,280
and making atonement.

450
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,325
What do you say?

451
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Rong.

452
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,040
Director Li is receiving a guest.

453
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,040
Please wait for a bit longer.

454
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Secretary Zhang,

455
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,640
I've got an emergency.

456
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,920
Could you please

457
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,199
ask Director Li for an exception

458
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,350
so that he'll meet me first?

459
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,280
But...

460
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,319
Please.

461
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,719
For my father's sake.

462
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,950
Wait a minute, then. I'll go ask him.

463
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,040
All right.

464
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,300
How did it go?

465
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,225
I'm sorry, Mr. Rong.

466
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:10,300
This afternoon,

467
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,625
Director Li is too busy to meet you.

468
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:12,854
Please come some other day.

469
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:16,239
It's all right.

470
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:17,665
I'll be seated there.

471
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:18,784
I'll wait for five minutes.

472
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,525
Um...

473
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:24,095
Fine. As you wish.

474
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,839
I'm sorry, Uncle Li.

475
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,040
I came to bother you

476
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,239
with such a little problem.

477
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:40,465
It doesn't matter, Xu'an.

478
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,675
Your father and I

479
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:43,599
lived in the same dorm

480
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,079
when we went to school.

481
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,400
We've been friends for decades.

482
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,920
It's just a little favor.

483
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,025
Don't bother to thank me.

484
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,811
Unfortunately, your father died early

485
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,171
and was buried in the US.

486
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,760
I didn't see him before he died.

487
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,839
Now that you're back,

488
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,340
why not come often

489
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,675
and visit me?

490
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,119
I certainly will.

491
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,009
Mr. Rong Jiashang

492
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,300
will visit you often, too.

493
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:07,969
Director Li.

494
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,881
Mr. Rong, you haven't left yet?

495
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,280
Mr. Rong, I guess you also came

496
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
for Dr. Feng, right?

497
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Don't worry.

498
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,600
Uncle Li is very fair.

499
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:18,319
I've explained to him

500
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,450
what happened.

501
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,325
He knows very well

502
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,625
that Dr. Feng was involved.

503
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:22,224
So,

504
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:23,865
the amnesty has been signed.

505
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,750
Thank you, Director Li.

506
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:38,280
Mother,

507
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:40,560
have some hot tea

508
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,880
to warm yourself up.

509
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:45,560
It's all right.

510
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,160
I'll go check it out.

511
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,920
Don't worry.

512
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:57,675
Concubine Sun,

513
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,239
what brings you here?

514
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,040
Is there anything wrong
with Fanglin or Fanghua?

515
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:03,520
Has your brother

516
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,675
been released?

517
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,380
Not yet.

518
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,239
Come on in.

519
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,239
Come in before we talk.

520
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:18,325
Concubine Sun,

521
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:19,599
take your seat.

522
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,300
Mother,

523
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:23,079
this is Concubine Sun
of the Rong family.

524
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:25,880
Let me get you some water.

525
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:30,315
Do you know your brother

526
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:33,800
will be executed this noon?

527
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,264
What?

528
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,574
What did you say?

529
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,000
Who told you that?

530
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,230
Why would my son be executed?

531
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,439
Mother, take it easy.

532
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,911
It's not true, is it?

533
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:49,719
I heard Mr. Jiashang
talk to Master about it.

534
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,875
Now that I'm aware of this,

535
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:51,955
how could you not know?

536
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:53,050
So, it's not true.

537
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,880
Right?

538
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:54,839
Concubine Sun,

539
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,125
who told you this?

540
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:57,486
It's not true, of course.

541
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,199
Mother,

542
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,600
I'll go check it out.

543
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:03,239
Go check it out.

544
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,850
Hurry.

545
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,325
Go check...

546
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,405
Concubine Sun,

547
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,225
what are you doing?

548
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,760
Is there some misunderstanding?

549
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,550
Put the gun down first.

550
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,200
Let's keep cool.

551
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:24,385
Master said,

552
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,750
as long as I kill you,

553
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,079
he'll save Dr. Feng.

554
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,250
Why?

555
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,100
- Why?
- Mother.

556
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,111
I'm sorry.

557
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,761
No one can save him, but Master.

558
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,675
I like you.

559
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:41,850
I don't want to hurt you.

560
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,359
But I don't have another choice.

561
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,800
Master won't save Shixun
unless I kill you.

562
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,280
He's dying!

563
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,400
Calm down.

564
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,000
This can't be true.

565
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:51,838
If it were true,

566
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,175
Mr. Meng would tell me.

567
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:56,119
Don't let Rong Dingkun fool you.

568
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,625
He's very dishonest

569
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,680
and he always lies.

570
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,999
He can't be trusted.

571
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,200
No.

572
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:05,546
No.

573
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,969
Mr. Jiashang said that, too.

574
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,680
I heard him say that.

575
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,765
I don't dare to gamble.

576
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,415
Miss Feng, if you were me,

577
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:15,850
would you dare to gamble

578
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,560
when Mr. Jiashang was dying?

579
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:22,406
Concubine Sun,

580
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,050
calm down.

581
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,050
Listen to me.

582
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,686
Rong Dingkun hates me a lot.

583
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:30,959
What if he doesn't keep his promise

584
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,725
after you kill me?

585
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Put the gun down.

586
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,345
I'm taking you to see my brother,

587
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:42,385
all right?

588
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,959
No, no, it's too late.

589
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:53,250
He'll be executed in two hours.

590
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,375
Shizhen, Shizhen.

591
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,150
Don't move!

592
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,680
Mother.

593
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,400
Calm down.

594
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,800
As long as I kill you...

595
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,920
After I kill you,

596
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:12,195
Rong Dingkun will save Shixun.

597
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,000
He promised me.

598
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,975
As long as I kill you,

599
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,425
he'll save Shixun.

600
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,350
Concubine Sun.

601
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,294
Shizhen, are you all right?

602
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,839
Shixun.

603
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,040
Mother.

604
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,760
You're back?

605
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,775
I'm back.

606
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:01,056
You'll be all right.

607
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:04,875
There's no bullet in the gun.

608
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,000
I was just

609
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,175
scaring her

610
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:25,236
so that she would beg Rong Dingkun.

611
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,300
I didn't mean to hurt her.

612
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,114
I know.

613
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,611
I know.

614
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,830
Rong Dingkun misled you to trust him.

615
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
I don't blame you.

616
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:42,655
I don't blame you.

617
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm glad...

618
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,786
you're alive.

619
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,375
I'll always remember

620
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:00,975
how you tried to help me.

621
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,750
My name is Sun Shaolan.

622
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,850
Shaolan means great momentum.

623
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,775
Shizhen, the letter.

624
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,600
(To Mr. Feng Shixun at Surgical Clinic
of Red House Hospital)

625
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,175
It's the letter your sister Shaoqing
wrote to you.

626
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,000
Letter...

627
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:43,075
Letter...

628
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:46,025
(To Mr. Feng Shixun at Surgical Clinic
of Red House Hospital)

629
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:38,800
Sun Shaolan.

630
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,449
Shaolan means great momentum.

631
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,975
I've kept it in mind.

632
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,869
I've kept it in mind.

633
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:53,900
I've kept it in mind.

634
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,499
I underestimated my father.

635
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,746
I never expected him
to have an evil plan

636
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:32,675
even under such circumstances.

637
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,500
I've bribed the police.

638
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:43,919
Anyway,

639
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,775
she's your father's concubine.

640
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:47,639
As for the rest of the case,

641
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,225
we'll leave it to you.

642
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,150
Where's my brother?

643
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,825
He's still in there.

644
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:04,520
He just came out of the prison

645
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,679
and then saw Concubine Sun die.

646
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,921
Emotionally,

647
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,439
he's breaking down.

648
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,975
Leave him alone.

649
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,075
Today,

650
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:17,475
I should say sorry.

651
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:19,350
I shouldn't have shot her hurriedly.

652
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:22,080
It's not your fault.

653
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,560
You were trying to save me.

654
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,120
Looks like Qin Shuigen

655
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,175
really wants to kill me.

656
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,625
Last time, he asked Hashimoto Shiori
to kidnap me.

657
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:37,800
Luckily, Wen saved me then.

658
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,560
Today, he incited Concubine Sun
to kill me.

659
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,399
Sooner or later,

660
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:51,350
he and I will have
a life-and-death struggle.

661
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,275
I know.

662
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:35,800
What?

663
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,799
Your beloved woman finally died?

664
00:38:41,325 --> 00:38:42,444
Concubine Sun died.

665
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,000
Are you satisfied now?

666
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,201
What a woman!

667
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,650
Quite useless.

668
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,700
Concubine Sun had a son for you

669
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,730
and she'd been your concubine for years.

670
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,950
But in the end,

671
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,075
she was a mere chess piece, right?

672
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,621
She was with me,

673
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:28,946
but she loved

674
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:32,906
someone else.

675
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:35,450
Just like you,

676
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,609
she was an ungrateful woman.

677
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,125
You love Feng Shizhen

678
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,900
and she loved Feng Shixun.

679
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:53,750
Funny.

680
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Funny.

681
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,560
How funny!

682
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,000
Mr. Jiashang,

683
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:28,479
here are all the stock right documents

684
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:29,598
and real estate assignments
of the Rong family.

685
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,425
(Individual Share Transfer Agreement
of Rong Company)

686
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:37,700
(Transferred to: Feng Shizhen)

687
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,200
Mr. Jiashang,

688
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,320
are you really

689
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,325
(Transferred by: Rong Jiashang)
transferring all these to Miss Feng?

690
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,675
They should have been hers.

691
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,120
After Fanghua's wedding,

692
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,321
give them to her

693
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:50,675
on my behalf.

694
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:58,525
You've had hard days lately.

695
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,410
After doing the last thing,

696
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,360
go back home without concern

697
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,399
and accompany your child
for his treatment.

698
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,875
Thank you, Mr. Jiashang.

699
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:10,880
Take care.

700
00:41:30,145 --> 00:41:32,600
(Rong Dingkun, whose original name is
Qin Shuigen, did the following crimes...)

701
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,520
Father,

702
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,125
I've given you too many chances.

703
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:42,399
I can no longer indulge you.

704
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:45,075
After everything is over,

705
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,000
I'll atone for your sins with you.

706
00:42:57,725 --> 00:42:58,879
What a nice day!

707
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,750
