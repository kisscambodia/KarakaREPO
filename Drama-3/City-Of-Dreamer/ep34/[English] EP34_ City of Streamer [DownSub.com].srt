00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,500
=City of Streamer=

2
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 34=

3
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,010
He didn't want the house
known to others.

4
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,559
So he wanted to merge Wenchunli.

5
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,246
And he burned it.

6
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,080
But he dared not to touch this house,

7
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,511
because…

8
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:58,695
because my father's body is in it.

9
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,679
Come on,

10
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,440
don't torture yourself.

11
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,399
You need some rest,

12
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,880
and some drink.

13
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Miss Feng,

14
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:28,715
don't push yourself too hard.

15
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,355
You've done so much.

16
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,305
It's hard for you.

17
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,464
I'm going to Wenchunli.

18
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,130
Who is it?

19
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,330
It's late.

20
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,425
Who is it?

21
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,600
Open the gate.

22
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,094
I'm going inside.

23
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,414
It's in disrepair and not safe.

24
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,830
I've ordered them to check it out first.

25
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,275
I'll go, too.

26
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,040
You two,

27
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,079
watch the gate,

28
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,640
and keep me updated.

29
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,375
- Yes.
- Yes.

30
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,110
Is it here?

31
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:10,354
Go check around.

32
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,090
Em.

33
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:19,035
Only some worn out beds in it,

34
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:20,234
nothing else.

35
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,480
You may wait in the car.

36
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,486
I'll handle it here.

37
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
I wonder

38
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,940
if Qin Shuigen killed a man here,

39
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,000
what would he do to the body.

40
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,079
There were many lodgers.

41
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,000
Digging a hole would make noises.

42
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,079
He must conceal the body

43
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,519
quietly and rapidly.

44
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,000
So,

45
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,200
he must have gone out

46
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,079
to cash the lottery,

47
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,970
then he came back,
bought the entire house,

48
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,770
and kicked out all the lodgers.

49
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:27,775
After that,

50
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:30,559
he didn't have to

51
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,160
take time to move the body.

52
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:36,996
So, Qin Shuigen

53
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,465
made the house a tomb
to conceal the body.

54
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:44,720
My sister-in-law said

55
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,920
that man looked very like him.

56
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,559
He thought it was amazing.

57
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,480
Was his name

58
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:52,359
Qin Shuigen?

59
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,319
His name…

60
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm not sure.

61
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,079
He was a mason.

62
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,550
The wall!

63
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,279
My aunt has mentioned

64
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,125
that friend who looked like my father

65
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,511
was a mason.

66
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,200
The wall.

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Wen.

68
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,850
Yes.

69
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,839
Check all the walls.

70
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,950
Check whether any one is hollow.

71
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,519
Yes.

72
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,440
Go.

73
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,950
Got it! Got it!

74
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,169
Here it is.

75
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,720
The wall is hollow.

76
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,175
Are you ready for this?

77
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:07,000
Break it!

78
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:08,975
Yes.

79
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,720
Done.

80
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,760
We found this from him.

81
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,479
It's not yours.

82
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,400
It's your brother's.

83
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,350
(Li)

84
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,320
Fifteen years!

85
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:59,014
From when we moved to Wenchunli

86
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,620
to the time I went
to the university in Ginling,

87
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:08,464
it's been 15 years,

88
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,461
and he's been always beside me.

89
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,700
I've hated him since I was a child.

90
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,595
I-I hate that

91
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,330
this man was my father.

92
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,039
Over the years,

93
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,899
I believed

94
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,320
he was hiding somewhere

95
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,970
living with disgrace.

96
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,600
I didn't know

97
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,350
for 15 years

98
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,725
he's been always beside me.

99
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,277
He…

100
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,004
he was coming home.

101
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,950
(Li)

102
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,070
He'd bought my brother's longevity lock.

103
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,900
My father was coming home.

104
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:11,606
I've hated him for years!

105
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,900
We've found him.

106
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,749
He won't blame you.

107
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,440
He won't blame you.

108
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,919
You've found him.

109
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,264
There, there,

110
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,440
Shizhen.

111
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:02,775
No!

112
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,550
No! No! No!

113
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:08,159
No!

114
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,919
No!

115
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,400
Mr. Jiashang.

116
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,520
Coming.

117
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,050
Mr. Jiashang.

118
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,625
Em.

119
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,919
Master is having a bad dream.

120
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,250
He's screaming.

121
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,039
Where is the downer from the doctor?

122
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,239
Oh, in the storeroom.

123
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:32,919
Go get it.

124
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
I'm going for it.

125
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,119
Miss Fanglin.

126
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,525
Jiashang,

127
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,350
is Father alright?

128
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,000
He's fine.

129
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,239
I'll take care of him.

130
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,200
Go to bed.

131
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,559
Tomorrow Fanghua

132
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,760
will try on her wedding dress.

133
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,375
Jiashang,

134
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,975
tell the truth, please.

135
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,559
Father is on this condition.

136
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,200
is it proper that I get married now?

137
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,000
There's nothing improper.

138
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,625
I promise.

139
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,159
Father will

140
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,359
attend your wedding.

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,159
Go to bed.

142
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,321
Don't come!

143
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,650
You made me do this!

144
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,919
It was not my fault!

145
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,359
It was not my fault!

146
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,185
Jiashang, he's coming!

147
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,239
You must defend our family!

148
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,485
Kill him!

149
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Kill him!

150
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,320
Who is he?

151
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,341
Is he He?

152
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,900
I did…

153
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,520
I did…

154
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,919
I did seal him up.

155
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,075
Take care of him.

156
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:04,700
Yes.

157
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,811
Hello,

158
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,719
is that the newspaper office?

159
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:05,880
Yes.

160
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,515
I have a piece of explosive news.

161
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,035
There is a dead body

162
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,400
in Rong's old house.

163
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,280
Yes.

164
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,159
If you're interested,

165
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,799
I'll tell you a good story.

166
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,525
Come in.

167
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,119
Mr. Jiashang.

168
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:32,000
Bad news!

169
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,520
Something happened in Wenchunli!

170
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,559
(Dead Body Found in Wenchunli)
Big news! Big news!

171
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,320
(A Blessed or Blooded House)
Dead body found in Rong's upscale house!

172
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,880
Is the house blessed or blooded?

173
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,919
Big news! Big news!

174
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,440
Dead body found in Rong's upscale house!

175
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,880
Is the house blessed or blooded?

176
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Mr. Jiashang's coming!

177
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,280
- Over there!
- Mr. Jiashang's coming!

178
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,900
- Mr. Jiashang.
- Mr. Jiashang.

179
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,359
- Mr. Jiashang.
- What happened in there?

180
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,719
- Mr. Jiashang, say something.
- What happened in there?

181
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,125
- Mr. Jiashang.
- Mr. Jiashang.

182
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,280
What happened in there?

183
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,900
Mr. Jiashang, who is that body?

184
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,719
What happened in there?

185
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,880
Mr. Jiashang, can you say something?

186
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,719
Just one question.

187
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,119
Mr. Jiashang, could you say something?

188
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:09,975
What happened in there?

189
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:10,919
Say something, please.

190
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,000
We bought the plot by chance.

191
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,599
We have no idea about

192
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,039
who that body in it is.

193
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,280
The Rong family

with the police

195
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,679
to find the truth.

196
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,239
May the dead rest in peace.

197
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,475
Thank you.

198
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,359
Okay, that's it.

199
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,525
- Come back!
- Mr. Jiashang, tell us more, please.

200
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:28,800
- Mr. Jiashang!
- Mr. Jiashang!

201

- One more question, Mr. Jiashang!
- Mr. Jiashang!

202
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,550
- Mr. Jiashang.
- Mr. Jiashang!

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,840
Take a look.

204
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,650
Do you know him?

205
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,400
How could I know this body?

206
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,679
I heard the reporters had the body

207
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,320
before you come here.

208
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:43,200
Em.

209
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Was the body found from here

210
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,200
or somebody put it in here?

211
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,250
Mr. Jiashang.

212
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,550
There's something strange.

213
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,125
We found a scrip

214
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,475

can I

222
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,040
have this scrip?

223
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
Somebody owes my father money.

224
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll ask him what has happened.

225
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,050
This scrip

226
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,545
looks very new.

227
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,475
It must be a trick.

228
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,839
It's not effective evidence.

229
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,200
Mr. Jiashang,

230
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,800
you may take it.

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
knocked open the wall,

314

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,719

take the kids

to the villa out of the town.

381
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,760

- I…

382
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,680
The rumors

383
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,429
will go down before the New Year.

384
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:47,119
I don't care about the reporters.

385
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,839
The newspaper insinuate that

386
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,160
we didn't rebuild the house

387
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,800
because we're concealing…

388
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:56,959
a dead body.

389
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,675
And that

390
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:01,394
we knew what is in the house.

391
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,160
Newspapers make sensational stories

392
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,880
to please the readers.

393
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,375
Our rivals

394
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,455
are taking measures to beat us down.

395
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It also says sorcery and cult,

396
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,479
and we get rich because of this.

397
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,839
Alright, forget the gossip.

398
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,359
I have a meeting in the company.

399
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,599
I'll talk with Jiashang

400
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,520
about the countermeasure.

401
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,439
Take care of yourself.

402
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:27,125
Oh.

403
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,630
I heard

404
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,304
that you had another family.

405
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:13,225
Who told you that?

406
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:15,705
Ma'am and Uncle Zhao.

407
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:17,880
They also said

408
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:20,225
that they died of illness.

409
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,839
No.

410
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,150
They were my brother's family.

411
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,400
Mrs. Bai had a son and a daughter

412
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,599
with your brother?

413
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,920
Where is he now?

414
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,160
You'll never see him.

415
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:04,766
What have you done?

416
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:06,955
Who is that man?

417
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:11,965
You'll never see He.

418
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,175
(IOU Signed by Qin Shuigen)

419
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,680
He?

420
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,600
Qin Shuigen.

421
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,295
What's the relation between them?

422
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,970
Secretary Chen!

423
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,760
Mr. Jiashang.

424
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,239
I need you to find

425
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,599
a man named Qin Shuigen.

426
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,359
Yes.

427
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,199
In Wenchunli,

428
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,319
a blessed house is blooded

429
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,911
since a dead body was found.

430
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,718
Residents are claiming refunds

431
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,225
and have sued Rong's Company.

432
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,275
As of this broadcast,

433
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,335
Rong Dingkun has not shown up.

434
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,000
Big news! Big news!

435
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,199
Big news, sir.

436
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,160
Give me one.

437
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,800
Sir.

438
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,359
Give me one, thank you.

439
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,719
The police invited a western doctor

440
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,760
to examine the body.

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640
He was murdered.

442
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,239
But the Rongs denied,

443
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,550
saying it's a setup.

444
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,640
Years ago,

445
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,479
half of the ships in the port

446
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,680
carried Rong's opium and arms.

447
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:49,355
They had a hundred or more porters.

448
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,880
And their foes are more than that.

449
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,800
Killing a man and burying him
in the wall

450
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,920
are no big deal.

451
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,650
Rong Dingkun hasn't shown up yet.

452
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,680
It's said he was shot

453
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,200
and paraplegic.

454
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,640
Then again,

455
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,479
it seems the Rongs are cursed.

456
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Since they got rich,

457
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,800
bad things always happen.

458
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,000
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

- Leave here!

- have you been kidnapped?

Miss Fanghua,

466
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,160
say something, please.

- Hey, what're you doing?
- Miss Fanghua!

00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,760
Mr. Jiashang! Mr. Jiashang!

471
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm sorry.

472
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,959
Don't let me see you again,

473
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,000
or I'll pull something else out of you!

474
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,920
Yes, yes.

475
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:09,550
Get out!

476
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:10,920
Yes.

477
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,599
Is the electrified fence a toy?

478
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,069
How did he come in?

479
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,400
If he was a foe,

480
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,680
the whole Rong family

481
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,599
would have been slaughtered!

482
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,479
Forgive us, Mr. Jiashang.

483
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,359
I'll fix it now.

484
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,575
Jiashang,

485
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,920
rumors are bandied about in the family.

486
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,750
I heard something happened
in the company.

487
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,280
Is the family falling?

488
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,550
Don't worry.

489
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
I can manage.

490
00:31:43,025 --> 00:31:44,599
I won't let our family fall.

491
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:49,745
His car is coming.

492
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,920
Is it Mr. Jiashang's car?

493
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,199
Mr. Jiashang!

494
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:54,280
Yes.

495
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,439
- Mr. Jiashang.
- Mr. Jiashang.

496
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,875
- Make way! Make way!
- Can you say something?

497
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,175
- Make way!
- Mr. Jiashang.

498
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,625
Make way!

499
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,719
- Mr. Jiashang, this way.
- Mr. Jiashang.

500
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,680
- Mr. Jiashang, say something, please.
- Back off!

501
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,560

- Our stock falls to limit
- Mr. Jiashang,

503
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:06,900
- right after the market opens.
- say something, please.

505
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,079
asking you for an explanation.

506
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,549
Good timing.

507
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,520
And,

508
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,520
the assistant manager in Wenchunli

509
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
just called.

510
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,839
Eighty percent of buyers claim refunds

511
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,050
or they'll sue us.

512
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,525
What shall we do?

513
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,855
Sell the plot in the south.

514
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,250
You mean…?

515
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,239
Refund

516
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,359
the claimers.

517
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:32,800
All of them?

518
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,479
You make

519
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,275
a detailed plan.

520
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:40,880
Look at the mess.

521
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,920
What's happening?

522
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,400
And there is no solution.

523
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,239
It can't go like this.

524
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,560
Too many troubles.

525
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:52,040
Why is it you?

526
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,400
Where's your father?

527
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,239
I want Rong Dingkun.

528
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:55,900
Yeah.

529
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
This is serious.

530
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,920
He can't hide behind his son!

531
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,375
- Yeah. He can't.
- Yeah.

532
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,416
Uncles, calm down.

533
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,400
My father is hurt.

534
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,920
I'm his sole agency
for the shareholders' meeting.

535
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,400
If you have any questions,

536
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,681
ask me.

537
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,280
In this case,

538
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,429
I'll come straight to the point.

539
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,959
The company

540
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,479
is going down

541
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:23,934
to a dilemma.

542
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,079
The company's reputation

543
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,650
is at the bottom.

544
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,239
All these ascribe to

545
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,000
the Rong's private scandals.

546
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,400
Since

547
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,359
Rong Dingkun would rather hide at home

548
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,719
than fix the situation,

549
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,800
why are we

550
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,925
staying here

551
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,439
and wasting our time?

552
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah.

553
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,520
We quit the Board.

554
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,094
- We claim proportional
- Yeah, we quit the Board.

555
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,119
refunds of our investment.

556
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:48,319
- Yeah, we claim refunds.
- We claim refunds, yeah.

557
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,079
We quit the Board.

558
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:49,800
- Yeah,
- We quit.

559
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,680
we quit the Board.

560
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,599
My father has chaired the Board
for more than 20 years

561
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,439
and never owes you a penny.

562
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,920
Now we are in such a little crisis

563
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,359
and you get scared

564
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:01,895
and are running away.

565
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:06,524
Seniors, too many years' comforts

566
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,100
have washed off the courage you've had.

567
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,479
What do you mean?

568
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,375
We've been fighting

569
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,879
for years for all these.

570
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:17,554
Now they are all going with the wind.

571
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:18,919
If we don't make ourselves safe,

572
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:21,199
are you expecting us
to lose everything with you?

573
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,439
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

574
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:25,000
I've read the book
of your annual dividends.

575
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,890
You get paid but do nothing to help,

576
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,879
and you use your shareholder's capacity

577
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,239
to seek personal profits.

578
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,705
My father never complains.

579
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,520
Now Rong's Company is in crisis

580
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,974
and you're kicking off the ladder.

581
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,754
That's really impressive.

582
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,560
The company is in crisis.

583
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,650
But it's not so bad
that we have to break the partnership.

584
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,264
It's understandable that

585
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:58,425
you want to cash your shares and retire.

586
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,280
But don't go too far.

587
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,679
Or our brotherhood will be affected.

588
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,640
I think it's acceptable.

589
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,500
Gentlemen,

590
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,590
you are my uncles.

591
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,630
I've managed the company for a month

592
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:16,974
thanks to your help and instructions.

593
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,166
This is Rong's Company.

594
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,775
The Rongs must shoulder more burdens.

595
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:25,639
The founders will be treated fairly.

596
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,080
Since you've chosen your own way,

597
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,639
I wouldn't stand in your way.

598
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,000
But I, Rong Jiashang,

599
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,760
ask for only one thing.

600
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,479
I hope all of you,

601
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,479
for the sake of the brotherhood,

602
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,520
do my father and me a favor.

603
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
We'll have the right of first refusal.

604
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,760
I promise

605
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,120
you won't find a better buyer.

606
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,479
What do you say?

607
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,959
I think it's a good deal.

608
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,420
Alright.

609
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,439
Mr. Jiashang,

610
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,280
Inspector Wang is here.

611
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,075
I have an appointment.

612
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:07,325
Excuse me.

613
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,679
Gentlemen,

614
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,325
think it over.

615
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,475
Mr. Jiashang.

616
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:19,275
Inspector.

617
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,879
Congratulations.

618
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,309
You are clean.

619
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,120
Sit down, please.

620
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,600
Thank you.

621
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,625
What do you mean?

622
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:28,575
Days ago, an old widow

623
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,040
went to the police.

624
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,239
Someone opened her husband's tomb

625
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,840
and took the body.

626
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:34,840
I asked her.

627
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,600
That body's height is identical with

628
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,239
that of the one in Wenchunli.

629
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,100
So I sent my men to check it.

630
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,639
The finding is

631
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,439
the body of the old widow's husband

632
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,560
and the body from Wenchunli

633
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,679
are the same one.

634
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,959
And for the paper from the body,

635
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,120
it's apparent that

636
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,439
the paper is new.

637
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:53,700
Someone wrote the scrip

638
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,959
and put it in the body.

639
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
The whole thing

640
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,925
is a setup.

641
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:00,200
Wait.

642
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,320
Inspector.

643
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,000
Mr. Jiashang,

644
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,975
I can't take it.

645
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,134
I was doing my job.

646
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:11,239
I'm asking you for a favor.

647
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,550
The money

648
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,225
Well…

649
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:14,239
is for the widow

650
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,959
who lost her husband's body.

651
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,000
She needs a new tomb

652
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,300
to rest her husband.

653
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,479
Mr. Jiashang,

654
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,320
the widow

655
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:24,760
will get the money in full amount.

656
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:25,875
Good.

657
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:33,075
(Tablet of Deceased Father Rong Dingkun)

658
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:37,275
(Tablet of Deceased Mother Bai)

659
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:30,025
(Tablet of Deceased Mother Bai)

660
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:31,550
(Tablet of Deceased Father Rong Dingkun)

661
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,800
We just watch him go through this?

662
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,479
At least the Rong's family is crippled.

663
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,000
Their stock fell, business depressed,

664
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,080
but you got no profit.

665
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,239
And,

666
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,919
Rong Dingkun murdered for money.

667
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,925
This should be known to the world.

668
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,499
It will be known.

669
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,355
Miss Feng, Miss Xiao,

670
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,575
it's the New Year's Eve.

671
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:00,775
Mr. Meng invites you to Astor House.

672
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:02,159
The dinner is waiting for you.

673
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:03,750
Alright.

674
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,835
Let's go, Baoli.

675
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:06,925
Em.

676
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:37,050
(Wing On Department Store)

677
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,010
Alright.

678
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,000
Goodbye.

679
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,879
- Goodbye.
- Alright.

680
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,040
Goodbye, Uncle Wan.

681
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,000
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

682
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,975
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

683
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,425
- See you next time.
- Goodbye.

684
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,050
Alright.

685
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,000
- Goodbye.
- Alright.

686
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:48,625
Bro,

687
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,575
I trust in your capacity.

688
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:52,950
All the shades on you

689
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,025
will disappear.

690
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,639
Money comes itself.

691
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:56,850
Thank you.

692
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:58,625
Goodbye.

693
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,450
Mr. Jiashang, a minute please.

694
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,280
I'll get the car here.

695
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,750
(Astor House)

696
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,900
(Astor House)

697
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,231
Shizhen,

698
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,640
put on the coat.

699
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:27,750
Come on.

700
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,650
(Happy New Year)

701
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,600
Shizhen,

702
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:55,055
happy New Year.

703
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,775
Mr. Meng.

704
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:10,400
Em.

705
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:12,034
Drive me home, please.

706
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,340
It's time to go home.

707
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,980
Ready to have it out with them?

708
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:19,425
They'll understand me.

709
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,300
Better early than never.

710
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,325
Mr. Meng,

711
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,239
please look after

712
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,159
my aunt for a few days.

713
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,441
When everything is done,

714
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:32,965
I'll take her home.

715
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,450
Sure.

716
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,339
Wen.

717
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:38,950
Yes.

718
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,760
To Feng's house.

719
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:40,520
Yes.

720
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:50,825
(Changde Alley)

721
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,560
It's beautiful.

722
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,239
Mom, I want that one.

723
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,239
Happy New Year.

724
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,639
Happy New Year.

725
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,239
Good girl.

726
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:04,360
It's beautiful.

727
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,719
Thank you.

728
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,919
Mom, I want that.

729
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,675
Mom, I want that.

730
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:13,399
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

731
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:14,900
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

732
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,700
Good girl.

733
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,050
It's beautiful.

734
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:21,360
Thank you.
