3
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:01,760
What is it

4
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:03,275
that you're so engrossed in?

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,039
It's about cracking codes.

6
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,919
Seems fun.

7
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,100
You're such an all-round talent.

8
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,080
English, math,

9
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,600
archery, cryptography.

10
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,850
What else?

11
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,600
Let's see.

12
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:28,025
I can use guns,

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,775
daggers and ride horses

14
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,119
and I've taken classes from a woman

15
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,000
in basic self-defense.

16
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,800
Meng Xu'an was training me

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,075
as a spy,

18
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:42,800
not an assassin.

19
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,119
And I can pick locks

20
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:49,275
and gather intelligence.

21
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,039
Cracking codes is a skill

22
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,039
I picked up back in college.

23
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,279
Our math club used to study

24
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,100
all kinds of codes regularly.

25
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,175
Meng Xu'an

26
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,475
spared no effort to cultivate you.

27
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,639
He also tried to impose

28
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,850
his ideas on me.

29
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:16,725
But as you know,

30
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm more of

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,119
an independent thinker.

32
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,275
I just ignored his words.

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,919
I bet

34
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,200
you gave him headaches.

35
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,360
Meng Xu'an

36
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,960
demands

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,150
complete obedience and loyalty

38
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,880
but I challenged him a lot

39
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,925
and acted on my own.

40
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,639
When we fell out that day,

41
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,550
I gave him a piece of my mind.

42
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,014
He had to try so hard

43
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,656
to not strangle me.

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,475
He wouldn't hurt you.

45
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,575
He's just addicted to conquering others.

46
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,650
His goal is to bury my family.

47
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,734
I think

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,025
he likes you.

49
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,550
He likes me?

50
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:13,400
Yes.

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,119
That man hates everyone.

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,625
He's like

53
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,160
a grenade in a stove

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,559
that may explode anytime.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,239
He doesn't even like himself,

56
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,500
let alone anyone else.

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,359
He did say

58
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,040
I reminded him of his younger self.

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
Perhaps he let me go

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
out of empathy.

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,799
You know nothing about men.

62
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,100
Never mind.

63
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:45,175
Forget about him.

64
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,760
The night is still young.

65
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:57,475
(Huamei Photo Gallery)

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,600
Whose work do you prefer?

67
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,640
Excuse me. How much is this one?

68
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,799
Six yuan per meter.

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,160
Are you into Mr. Qi's?

70
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,750
It's my father.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,250
I bought a bracelet for my mother.

72
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,440
It's only fair

73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,000
to buy something for my father, too.

74
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
Sir,

75
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,875
I want all three of them.

76
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:35,755
Sure.

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,350
Wait.

78
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,440
I don't have that much money with me.

79
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,225
Relax.

80
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:41,799
I'll take them all.

81
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,800
Got it.

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,680
Keep the change.

83
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,600
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

84
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,981
Take them

85
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,519
as my house-warming gifts

86
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,799
to you.

87
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,519
What if my father asks me

88
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,040
how I could afford them?

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
Just tell him they're from a friend.

90
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,325
What do you want for dinner?

91
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
I like that place we went to yesterday.

92
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,050
Their food is good.

93
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,850
Alright.

94
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,640
Jiashang.

95
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,519
Miss Feng.

96
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,300
I'm surprised to see you here.

97
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,959
I'll leave you two alone.

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,600
I couldn't pay you a visit

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,440
during the mourning period earlier.

100
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
How's your father?

101
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,839
He's stable now.

102
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,580
What brings you to Peking?

103
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,000
I came with my father for business.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,559
What are the odds that we met here?

105
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,679
I'm sorry

106
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,450
for your engagement.

107
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,239
Miss Du doesn't know how good you are.

108
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,350
You deserve better anyway.

109
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:57,480
Jiashang,

110
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:59,040
if you're upset

111
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
and need someone to talk to

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,480
back in Shanghai,

113
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,920
you know where to find me.

114
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,025
Your family must still be grieving
for your brother.

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,750
I don't want to trouble you.

116
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,279
My father has been in deep sorrow

117
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,839
since he passed away.

118
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,279
I'm here to pick up

119
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,920
- art pieces and antiques
- Hold on.

120
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,160
to comfort him,

121
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,050
but I don't know much about them.

122
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,000
Could you give me a hand?

123
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,359
My father is an expert

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,775
but I'm no better than you.

125
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:25,776
Sorry.

126
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,040
I understand.

127
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,950
I'm glad to see you here.

128
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,525
How about we have dinner together?

129
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,079
And...

130
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,119
My evening is taken.

131
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,826
Sorry.

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,675
I see.

133
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,559
I'm going to other stores then.

134
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,920
What a small world!

135
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:05,720
All boxed up?

136
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,575
Yes.

137
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,110
It's getting dark.

138
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,125
Let's go back.

139
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:10,871
Sure.

140
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,280
I've meant

141
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,975
to ask you something.

142
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,960
Even if

143
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
you and Hashimoto Shiori

144
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,520
broke up years ago,

145
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,880
your relationship shouldn't be that bad.

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,359
But why

147
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,375
you disliked her

148
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,265
when you two first reunited

149
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:48,840
and your aversion

150
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,799
keeps growing since then?

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I was wondering

152
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,919
when you'd bring that up.

153
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,660
I've been wanting to know.

154
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,825
Honestly, she seems

155
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,599
to be two-faced.

156
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,025
But you two...

157
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,200
You already called her two-faced.

158
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:08,775
So why should I

159
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,000
be nice to her?

160
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,375
Is there any beef

161
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,280
between you guys?

162
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,919
Not really.

163
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:21,315
I was too dumb

164
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,700
and naively believed she liked me

165
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,225
but she was a two-timer.

166
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,386
She was keeping me close

167
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,700
while hooking up with local rich brats.

168
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,320
Hadn't I gone to surprise her that day

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
and overheard her conversation
with her mother,

170
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,559
I would've still been fooled.

171
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,675
You know why

172
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,975
I'm so sick of her?

173
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,679
She offered my father that Gold Kylin

174
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,159
if he let us marry

175
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,359
and asked him to kill Hashimoto Taichi

176
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,679
so that she'd support her brother

177
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,599
to be the successor.

178
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,100
Yet Meng Xu'an scared Hashimoto Taichi

179
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,880
to death

180
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,175
which played right into her hands.

181
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,520
You had been fooled by a woman once.

182
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,359
When you could finally move on,

183
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,520
I fooled you again.

184
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,719
You're nothing like her.

185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,850
You like me.

186
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,320
Despite what you say,

187
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,325
I know that.

188
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,400
You fool!

189
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,339
Why didn't you learn your lesson?

190
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,725
Why did you still choose to trust me?

191
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,750
You...

192
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,880
I should be upset.

193
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,775
Why are you feeling so?

194
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:12,799
Are you upset?

195
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:14,960
Of course!

196
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:18,184
I'd be upset if I woke up alone.

197
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,921
I'd be upset if all this
was just wishful thinking.

198
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,119
I'd be upset if you chose to be with me

199
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
out of sympathy.

200
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
Would that cheer you up?

201
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,950
Not sure.

202
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,450
I need more to confirm it.

203
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,125
It's ringing.

204
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,909
Hello?

205
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,080
Mr. Jiashang,

206
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,039
I hate to bother you

207
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,800
but your father is out of his coma.

208
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,039
When?

209
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,325
About 20 minutes ago.

210
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,080
He mumbled weakly

211
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,225
and passed out again.

212
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,400
The doctor said

213
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,200
he's

214
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,625
out of danger

215
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,119
and he'll soon wake up.

216
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:38,250
Mr. Jiashang,

217
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,000
are you coming home?

218
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,665
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

219
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:45,559
Oh, Mr. Jiashang,

220
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,440
there's something else.

221
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,840
I've found something

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,479
about Miss Feng's case

223
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,640
years back.

224
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,320
What is it?

225
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,039
It's too much

226
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,760
to explain on the phone.

227
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
I prefer to tell you face to face

228
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,575
when you get back.

229
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:01,400
Alright.

230
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:02,795
See you then.

231
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,150
Shizhen,

232
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,909
I'm going back to Shanghai
tomorrow morning.

233
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:28,465
I won't be away for too long.

234
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:30,840
Alright.

235
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,495
I wish you'd be like other girls,

236
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,791
bagging me to stay in tears.

237
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,719
You've been out for days.

238
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,475
If you were staying here any longer,

239
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,239
I'd assume your family went broke.

240
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,575
If I lost everything,

241
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,350
would you leave me?

242
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,094
If you lost everything?

243
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:09,726
As long as you still have your looks,

244
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,039
I don't mind supporting you.

245
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,599
I'll be back soon.

246
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:21,850
Good.

247
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,925
I'm here for you.

248
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,320
Miss Hashimoto.

249
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,080
Miss Feng.

250
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
What are you doing here?

251
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,300
Are you here to see Jiashang?

252
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,425
Yes.

253
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,679
Too bad, he returned
to Shanghai yesterday.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,625
I meant to invite him to lunch.

255
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,960
Now that he isn't here,

256
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,201
would you like to join me, Miss Feng?

257
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,119
That'd be my pleasure.

258
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,559
Miss Feng, we've got

259
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,960
fresh slender shad that you like.

260
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,400
Mr. Rong said to keep some for you.

261
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Would you like it to be served?

262
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,250
Is there anything you don't eat?

263
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,880
I don't eat spicy food.

264
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,799
Jiashang said

265
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,760
you lived in Chongqing for a few years.

266
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,119
The local cuisine

267
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:38,000
must be too hot for you.

268
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes, it was.

269
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,679
That's why Jiashang always took me

270
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,450
to a Cantonese Cuisine restaurant

271
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,760
after we met.

272
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:51,159
Then

273
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,039
we'd like a few light dishes.

274
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,640
Yes.

275
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,300
Thanks.

276
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:57,675
Cheers.

277
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,440
Miss Hashimoto,

278
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,700
do you miss those days in Chongqing?

279
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,300
Not really.

280
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,520
Living under someone else's roof

281
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,275
wasn't necessarily pleasant.

282
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,600
Enough about me.

283
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,840
We've known each other for a while

284
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,000
but we haven't got to have a good chat.

285
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,880
You must've had a successful career now.

286
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,425
I wouldn't call it successful

287
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,775
by teaching students

288
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:32,840
at a school.

289
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,640
You're independent and capable.

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,520
I have a lot to learn from you.

291
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,960
I doubt

292
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,625
if I could get a job on my own

293
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,786
enough to pay my breakfast.

294
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,799
You're of noble birth.

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,641
You don't need to work so hard.

296
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,559
A businessman's daughter

297
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,400
is nothing noble,

298
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,479
not to mention my mother
is only a concubine.

299
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,675
I'm nothing to my father.

300
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,475
By the way,

301
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,175
I read what happened

302
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,959
to your elder brother on the paper.

303
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,160
He died so young.

304
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry for your loss.

305
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,800
Well,

306
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,560
we all knew

307
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,839
that day was inevitable

308
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,599
but we thought

309
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,864
he'd die at home,

310
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
not at some auction

311
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,000
that turned into a disaster.

312
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,239
Speaking of which,

313
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,239
you saved Jiashang that day.

314
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:32,375
How did you know he was in danger?

315
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,000
I saw someone on the roof

316
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,479
with guns pointing at the stage

317
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,520
when coming downstairs.

318
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,875
I wouldn't be heard

319
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,760
amid the noise in the room,

320
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,479
so I flung him to the floor.

321
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,640
That was very bold of you.

322
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,040
I didn't think too much,

323
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,800
but now, I see how dangerous that was.

324
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,119
What about you?

325
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,719
Did you get hurt?

326
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,075
I'm fine

327
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,760
despite the shock.

328
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,800
When will you go back to Shanghai?

329
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,900
If everything goes well,

330
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,600
I'll settle here.

331
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,371
In Peking?

332
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:08,925
Yes.

333
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
And have a long-distance relationship

334
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,675
with Jiashang?

335
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:16,719
Miss Feng,

336
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,479
aren't you worried

337
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,839
leaving him alone in Shanghai?

338
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,959
He's not worried

339
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,175
leaving me alone here.

340
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,200
People come together

341
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,239
and break up all the time.

342
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,079
What will happen will happen.

343
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,239
Just let nature take its course.

344
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,650
You have a point.

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,800
Jiashang!

346
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,904
Sorry to keep you waiting.

347
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,505
No worries.

348
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,319
Why aren't you staying in the hotel?

349
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,160
I have classes every day.

350
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,439
The dorm is closer.

351
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,575
Can you stay with me tonight?

352
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,850
I haven't seen you for six days.

353
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,119
Whose fault is that?

354
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,700
You said it'd only be two days,

355
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:16,284
but you were gone for six days.

356
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,600
You are where my only home is.

357
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:21,800
Wherever I go,

358
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,949
I'll always come back to you.

359
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,680
Since when did you become

360
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
such a sweet talker?

361
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,310
You're melting my teeth.

362
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,981
What's new in Shanghai?

363
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,800
Nothing.

364
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
My father is still unconscious.

365
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,826
All is well at your house.

366
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,119
There's one thing, though.

367
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,560
Yunchi has proposed to Fanghua.

368
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,500
Really?

369
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:50,400
Yes.

370
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,680
He blamed himself

371
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,439
for what happened to Fanghua.

372
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,075
Knowing that she always likes him,

373
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,370
he decided to take the responsibility.

374
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,250
He's been

375
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,875
visiting her

376
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,959
with flowers and gifts these days,

377
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,586
which clearly touches Fanghua's heart.

378
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,225
I don't know much about him.

379
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,839
Do you want him

380
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:20,554
to marry your sister?

381
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,725
He's a loyal friend

382
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,040
and

383
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,429
a playboy.

384
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm sure

385
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,359
he'll treat Fanghua well

386
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:33,119
as she's my sister,

387
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,305
but I wonder if that kind of marriage

388
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,635
is what she wants.

389
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,560
He'll respect Fanghua

390
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,560
but I'm not sure

391
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,175
if he'll love her.

392
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,040
Fanghua likes him

393
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,920
and agrees to marry him

394
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,599
in hope of

395
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,040
a happy marriage.

396
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,725
I know.

397
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,560
That's why I don't think they should

398
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,199
get married from the very beginning.

399
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,520
But Fanghua

400
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,400
already said yes.

401
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,200
It's too late to stop her.

402
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,781
Can you give her a call

403
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,750
and talk to her

404
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,260
once we get back to the hotel?

405
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,425
Sure.

406
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,325
Hello. Who is this?

407
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,460
Fanghua,

408
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,880
it's me.

409
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,000
Miss Feng!

410
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,150
How have you been?

411
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,800
I'm good.

412
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,920
I heard you accepted
Wu Yunchi's proposal.

413
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm worried about you.

414
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:44,365
I know what I'm doing.

415
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,950
I've thought long and hard.

416
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,760
When he proposed to me,

417
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,199
I was mad at first.

418
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,479
I thought

419
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,199
I wasn't a vase he rented

420
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,750
and had to buy

421
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,750
if damaged.

422
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,479
I was cursed with bad luck.

423
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,560
It wasn't his fault.

424
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm not that cheap

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,625
who needs him to clean up the mess.

426
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,439
You're right.

427
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,050
Do you remember what I said?

428
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,160
No matter what happens to you,

429
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,775
you have a bright future

430
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,295
ahead of you.

431
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,175
No one else has ever said that.

432
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,075
Miss Feng,

433
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,160
my mother calls me a fool.

434
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,850
Mrs. Rong thinks I'm ungrateful.

435
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,650
Fanglin says

436
00:22:32,675 --> 00:22:34,900
it's nice to marry someone

437
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,520
I like.

438
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,239
It's nothing wrong to move on,

439
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,680
but I'm not sure

440
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
if Wu Yunchi is the right one for you.

441
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,675
I know

442
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,850
he proposed to me out of guilt

443
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,425
instead of love.

444
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,325
He's seeing other women

445
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,560
and he's kept a Yue Opera singer before.

446
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,719
Miss Feng,

447
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,079
I know very well what kind of man he is.

448
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,425
Then why did you agree to marry him?

449
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Fanghua,

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,321
listen,

451
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,839
marriage

452
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,600
won't make a man better,

453
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,119
but only worse.

454
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,839
Don't think

455
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,479
you can change him.

456
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,719
Although

457
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,675
you're free

458
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,075
to divorce him,

459
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,850
I hope you won't have to

460
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,199
go there.

461
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,199
You deserve

462
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,959
a good and happy marriage.

463
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,975
Thanks for your concern,

464
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,650
but I don't want too much

465
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:37,374
other than getting married

466
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,566
and entering the next stage of my life.

467
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,040
You know,

468
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,125
in my father's eyes,

469
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,450
all our marriage is business.

470
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,920
Those men he set me up with

471
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:51,850
are either rich or powerful

472
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,550
but their personality

473
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,119
isn't half as good as Yunchi's.

474
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,100
He's my best option.

475
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,901
Miss Feng,

476
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,975
you told me to move on

477
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:06,425
which is exactly what I'm doing.

478
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,565
I'm about to marry someone I like,

479
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,871
be a rich man's wife,

480
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,425
continue my extravagant life

481
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,525
and go to America with him

482
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,119
to pursue my passion in medicine.

483
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,239
We know

484
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,640
and respect each other.

485
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,825
To me, that's a happy ending.

486
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,719
Right now,

487
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,475
you don't feel it,

488
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,079
but

489
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,079
marriage without love

490
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:40,760
is going to

491
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,880
chip your heart away every single day.

492
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,079
It's only a matter of time

493
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,400
before you can't take it anymore.

494
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,479
Aren't you also taking risks

495
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,475
in your relationship with my brother?

496
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,640
What we have isn't that complicated.

497
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,125
Neither of us

498
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,760
is planning a future together.

499
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,839
We just live in the moment.

500
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,319
Do you love him?

501
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I do.

502
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,359
And he loves me back.

503
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,079
I enjoy every day

504
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,625
we have.

505
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,200
I envy you two.

506
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,725
You're lucky.

507
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,100
If

508
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,050
this incident teaches me anything,

509
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,000
that is,

510
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,650
luck is a privilege.

511
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:37,175
I need to face it that I'm unprivileged

512
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,875
and choose

513
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,760
what's in my best interest.

514
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,719
Fine.

515
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,920
If that's your decision,

516
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,575
I'll respect that.

517
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,280
Fanghua,

518
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:54,505
congratulations on your engagement.

519
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,560
Thank you, Miss Feng.

520
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:12,095
What did she say?

521
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,079
She said a lot.

522
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,800
All in all,

523
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,479
she seems to like Wu Yunchi so much

524
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,225
that she's willing to take the risk.

525
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,239
That's her lifetime happiness.

526
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,950
The stake is too high.

527
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,925
As far as I know,

528
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,280
those outgoing,

529
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:40,815
foxy and fierce girls are Yunchi's type.

530
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,050
He loves conquering them.

531
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,925
Fanghua is simple

532
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:48,496
and honest.

533
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,725
However much she does for him,

534
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,125
he won't spare her a glance.

535
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,600
I can tell him to be good to my sister,

536
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,125
but once they're married,

537
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:03,475
I can't interfere in their private life.

538
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Are you needed back for their wedding?

539
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,975
Mrs. Rong will take care of that.

540
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,100
Yunchi and Fanghua

541
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,479
aren't in a rush.

542
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,040
They set the date

543
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,880
on March 7th.

544
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,950
Yunchi is taking it seriously

545
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,000
by going to the church

546
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,880
to be baptized for Fanghua.

547
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,319
That's a good start.

548
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,050
Maybe he'll stop seeing others

549
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,479
and

550
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,119
be a good husband.

551
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,200
I hope so.

552
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,160
Hey,

553
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,079
you aren't yourself tonight.

554
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,560
What makes you say that?

555
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,280
You're staring at me all night.

556
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,650
Is there anything wrong?

557
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,925
Nothing.

558
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:29,975
I miss you a lot.

559
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,934
Hashimoto Shiori dropped by

560
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:38,150
after you left.

561
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,025
What did she want?

562
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,350
To see you.

563
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,560
We had lunch together

564
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,825
and then she left.

565
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,950
Did she do anything to you?

566
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,079
Of course not.

567
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,099
She's smarter than that.

568
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,275
If she comes again,

569
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,599
just ignore her.

570
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,800
She's returned to Shanghai.

571
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,525
I don't think we'll meet again.

572
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,000
Forget about her.

573
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,640
Can you still feel the pain?

574
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,760
It stopped a long time ago.

575
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Why did you ask?

576
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,400
Does it look scary?

577
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,375
No.

578
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,915
I feel bad for you

579
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,680
that you suffered so much

580
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,950
when you were little.

581
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,719
I did

582
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,719
but I've forgotten most of it.

583
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,375
I was too young

584
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,625
to remember the pain.

585
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,800
The good thing is

586
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:13,239
I'm having my share of luck now.

587
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,880
Shizhen,

588
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,509
I wish none of that had happened to you

589
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,325
before we met

590
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,160
and I had found you earlier.

591
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,880
I'm happy now.

592
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,520
Thanks to you,

593
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,400
I'm living the best days of my life.

594
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
But

595
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,904
who'd do this

596
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,925
to a little girl?

597
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,625
My father.

598
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,175
What?

599
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:16,895
I mean

600
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,880
the biological one.

601
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,600
Back in Bailiu Town,

602
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:32,874
when I asked you not to

603
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,379
get to the bottom of my background,

604
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,640
you didn't know why.

605
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,100
Now, you do.

606
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,160
I don't remember much

607
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,650
about my childhood

608
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,025
except for

609
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,119
one thing.

610
00:32:05,075 --> 00:32:06,675
My mother took me to see a man

611
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,325
and asked me to call him father

612
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,300
before she passed away.

613
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,239
Really?

614
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,119
Are you sure?

615
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,775
Why would I lie?

616
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:37,925
Shizhen,

617
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,150
don't be too sad.

618
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,760
You don't have to

619
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,800
tell me everything.

620
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,479
I'm not sad.

621
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,880
I've been avoiding this for too long

622
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,319
because I'm scared of the truth.

623
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,875
Something tells me

624
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,275
my father had something to do

625
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,505
with my mother's death.

626
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,129
I'll have to face that eventually.

627
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:36,795
He killed your mother?

628
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,850
I wish he didn't,

629
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,920
but my mother couldn't be wrong

630
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,040
about who her husband was.

631
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,119
Why would he do that?

632
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,890
I wish I knew

633
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,925
what happened that year,

634
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,325
but I guess

635
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,119
only that man does.

636
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,325
After all these years,

637
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,700
he could be dead by now.

638
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,679
You told me at the party

639
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,300
that someone went to the police

640
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,175
to look for my body after that incident.

641
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
That was probably him.

642
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:49,175
There, there.

643
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,550
You don't know that. Just let it go.

644
00:34:59,025 --> 00:34:59,900
But

645
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:03,155
if it was him,

646
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,900
what would you do?

647
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,175
If he killed my mother,

648
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:21,050
I'll have to make him pay.

649
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,050
Killing my father

650
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,075
to avenge my mother's death,

651
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,975
how ironic

652
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,150
that is.

653
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,600
That doesn't change the fact

654
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,775
that he's your father.

655
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,070
That man

656
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,500
isn't qualified for that title.

657
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,760
I used to think

658
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,525
it's bad enough to have Rong Dingkun

659
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,175
as your father,

660
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:10,525
but now,

661
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,450
compared with mine,

662
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:18,106
he isn't that bad.

663
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,760
No matter what he did

664
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,350
to others,

665
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,700
he'd never

666
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:32,396
hurt his own children.

667
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:40,120
(Investigation Report Feng Shizhen)

668
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,239
Miss Feng's background

669
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,750
is all in that file.

670
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,394
Tell me about it.

671
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:47,925
Miss Feng and her mother

672
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,600
only traveled for a day.

673
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,800
They departed in the morning

674
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,679
and arrived at night.

675
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,800
Based on the distance and time,

676
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,199
(Investigation Report Feng Shizhen)
the place of departure

677
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,600
(Investigation Report Feng Shizhen)
could only be Guojia Town or Darong Town.

678
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,159
Over 20 women in those two towns

679
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,879
fit the description.

680
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,600
Eight of them are dead

681
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,239
including three died in labor

682
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,975
(From Guojia Town or Darong Town...)
and five died of illness.

683
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,879
I've tracked them down to their tombs.

684
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:11,320
Miss Feng

685
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,479
said her mother was surnamed Bai

686
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,560
but

687
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
none of them was.

688
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,679
So

689
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,399
we hit a dead end.

690
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,570
Not really.

691
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:22,560
A Mr. Qian in Darong Town

692
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,025
married a widow

693
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,120
and took in

694
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,959
her daughter

695
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,840
after his wife died.

696
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,000
That widow's late husband was a Bai.

697
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,035
Her daughter grew up

698
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:33,900
(Her daughter grew up in the Qian's)
in the Qian's,

699
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,280
(and was called Miss Qian)
so neighbors

700
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
all called her Miss Qian.

701
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,800
Later,

702
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,560
she was married into Guojia Town

703
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,760
and gave birth to a boy and a girl.

704
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,120
I already

705
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,760
checked her

706
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:47,840
and found that

707
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,320
after she got married,

708
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,600
(Investigation Record)
she fell ill and died.

709
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,635
(Rong Dingkun and Ms. Bai)
What's most suspicious

710
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,600
is the time of her death.

711
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,719
She died in January 21 years ago

712
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,879
when Miss Feng's mother

713
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,840
was killed.

714
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,039
Is there anyone of the Qian family left?

715
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,439
Mr. and Mrs. Qian

716
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:07,399
both died of plague.

717
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,129
Only their youngest daughter survived

718
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,360
who got married

719
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,890
and moved

720
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,046
to Guangzhou.

721
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,639
(Shanghai)
When her mother

722
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,320
(Shanghai)
and sister died,

723
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,199
(Bailiu Town-Guojia Town-Darong Town)
she didn't get to come back.

724
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,520
But...

725
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,360
What is it?

726
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,560
But

727
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,399
according to her,

728
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,150
her sister

729
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:31,800
married

730
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,500
a Rong

731
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:34,560
in Guojia Town.

732
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,639
She gave me this photo

733
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,560
and said

734
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:39,466
the couple in it

735
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,719
was her sister and her husband.

736
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,550
Mr. Jiashang,

737
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
that man

738
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:59,050
could be your remote relative.

739
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,750
Your uncle, maybe.

740
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:04,560
You and Miss Feng

741
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,959
are unlikely to be...

742
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,825
What?

743
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,200
Say it.

744
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:18,474
We're unlikely to be what?

745
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,525
Answer my question!

746
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,959
Finish your sentence.

747
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,350
What is it?

748
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:40,905
You...

749
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:42,896
You're unlikely...

750
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:46,040
to be...

751
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,350
siblings.

752
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,520
Mr. Jiashang...

753
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,159
Please don't!

754
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,159
I handled everything myself.

755
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,120
No one else knows.

756
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,760
I'll never betray you

757
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,875
or say a word

758
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:16,479
to others.

759
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,439
If you do,

760
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,050
I'll kill you.

761
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,175
I wouldn't dare!

762
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:23,679
I'd never do that!

763
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,040
I swear to heaven

764
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm loyal to you.

765
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:26,975
If not,

766
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,775
I would've burned that photo

767
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,800
instead of showing it to you.

768
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,945
You've got balls coming to me

769
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,475
with such a secret.

770
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,040
Mr. Jiashang,

771
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,150
without you,

772
00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:53,900
my son would be long gone.

773
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,560
I'm in debt to you.

774
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,900
You saved my son

775
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,359
and I'll do everything

776
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,360
to pay you back.

777
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,479
You can trust me.

778
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,925
You know

779
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,520
I can't take any risks.

780
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,975
If anything gets out,

781
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,120
think about your son in hospital.

782
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:17,400
Got it, Mr. Jiashang.

783
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,359
I understand.

784
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:29,750
Get up.

785
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,959
Take that woman who gave you the photo

786
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:42,750
to Shanghai.

787
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:44,959
I need to question her myself.

788
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,500
Yes. Yes, sir.
