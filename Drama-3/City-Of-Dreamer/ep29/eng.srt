But I did learn a lot.

165
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,819
The instructors were very strict.

166
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:29,125

when I was in the academy,

172

174

So I usually

175
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,900
challenged them in the woods
outside the west gate of the academy.

176
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,259

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,975
Do you believe,

192
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,000
as long as we have a bond,

193
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,299
wherever we are,

194
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,000
we'll finally meet?

195
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,789
I believe it.

196
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:38,700
I'll find you,

197
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,400
come to you

198
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,975
and ask you to dance with me.

199
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,181
I've always been curious.

200
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:46,625
At that time,

201
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,400
when I asked you to dance with me,

202
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,490
what did you think?

203
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,341
My mind was blank.

204
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,559
You looked at me
in an open and poised way.

205
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,075
Your eyes were like the moon
of a cloudless night.

206
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:03,286
When I looked at you,

207
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:04,719
I didn't think about anything.

208
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,400
I just wanted to go with you.

209
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,200
You were nervous,

210
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,875
but I was more nervous than you.

211
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,725
I was afraid my dance was clumsy
and I would step on you,

212
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,719
so,

213
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,679
I used all my skills

214
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,840
and had the most

215
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,500
serious dance of my life.

216
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,300
Were you actually
afraid of being laughed at?

217
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,110
I'm afraid of many things.

218
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,425
I'm afraid I'm too young

219
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,575
to support my entire family.

220
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,021
I'm afraid I'll make wrong decisions

221
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,125
and lose the support of my men.

222
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm afraid I'll lose myself

223
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,675
in the struggle for power
just like my father.

224
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:44,465
And the thing I'm most afraid of

225
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,650
is losing you.

226
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,925
Do you know?

227
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,789
I've told too many lies,

228
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,900
so many that I can't tell
the true from the false myself.

229
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,575
But that day,

230
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,375
when we were in the ballroom,

231
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,450
I saw you for the first time.

232
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,525
Though I didn't know who you were,

233
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,555
I liked you at the first glance.

234
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,725
It's true.

235
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
From now on,

236
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,100
you can only love me.

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,520
You can only think about me.

238
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,359
Sure.

239
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,300
You must see me as the most
handsome man in the world.

240
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,100
Yeah.

241
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,450
And,

242
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:46,816
you must kiss me
at least ten times a day.

243
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,139
Do I have to calculate it?

244
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:50,350
Yeah.

245
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,680
OK.

246
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,960
Ten times, then.

247
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,175
And,

248
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,550
every morning...

249
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,550
(Welcome)

250
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,640
Good night.

251
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,650
Jiashang.

252
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:14,195
Good night.

253
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:15,895
Miss Feng.

254
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,961
Miss Feng.

255
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,625
Did you forget something?

256
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,485
What?

257
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:32,475
You still owe me three kisses.

258
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,025
I don't want to wait till tomorrow.

I'll miss the train to Peking again.

294
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,959
If I don't send the telegram,

295
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,750
my brother will be worried.

296
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:42,964
Don't worry.

297
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,125
I have a way

298
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,625
to get you to Peking on time.

299
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,079
Talking about that,

300
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,199
you followed me to Nanjing.

301
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:51,796
What about your family?

302
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,141
Isn't your father still in the hospital?

303
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,439
Don't worry.

304
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,975
I've had everything arranged.

305
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,750
I'm not worried.

306
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,150
I'm just thinking
about Fanglin and Fanghua.

307
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:08,714
I wonder if they're okay.

308
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,225
Thanks for saving Fanghua.

309
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,130
I wasn't able to save her.

310
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,775
If I got there earlier,

311
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:21,896
she wouldn't have been hurt so badly.

312
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,680
You did your best.

313
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,250
It was the grudge
between the Rong and Meng family.

314
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,100
You didn't make any mistakes.

315
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,275
I'm making a mistake now.

316
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,825
I'm your mistake,

317
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:52,114
while you're the best choice
I've ever made.

318
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,894
You still get many years ahead of you.

319
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,569
Isn't it too early

320
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,000
to say it now?

321
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,139
You're my light.

322
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,960
Every time I see you,

323
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:10,085
I feel like I've woken up

324
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,280
from a nightmare.

325
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,479
You remind me not to forget my dreams.

326
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,591
You saved me again and again.

327
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,200
You pulled me back from the cliff edge.

328
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,700
Shizhen.

329
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,560
You don't know

330
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:34,644
how happy I am now.

331
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,439
Long time no see.

332
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,479
The plane is ready.

333
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,439
You can take off any time.

334
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,610
Thanks a lot.

335
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,530
No problem.

336
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,719
Jesus!

337
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:02,334
Are you surprised?

338
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,495
I love your looks when you're happy.

339
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,839
Do you remember

340
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,640
I told you

341
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,799
I would take you to fly?

342
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,450
Yeah.

343
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,950
Wanna see your man piloting a plane?

344
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:14,225
Come with me.

345
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,560
Jiashang.

346
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,000
When did you learn to fly?

347
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,040
Before returning to Shanghai,

348
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,839
I learned in Chongqing for a full year.

349
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,480
Are you afraid?

350
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,920
Today I'm piloting the plane alone.

351
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,000
With you,

352
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,225
I'm not afraid of anything.

353
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,359
Don't worry.

354
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,920
I won't crush it.

355
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,280
Hold on.

356
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,875
Yeah.

357
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,675
(G-EAKA 92)

358
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,785
Shizhen, look!

359
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,119
Amazing!

360
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,780
This is the scenery
I always want you to see.

361
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,040
I've been thinking about it for long.

362
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,525
Shizhen, look over there.

363
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,300
Jiashang,

364
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:06,280
if there are gods,

365
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,609
will they be watching us?

366
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,439
Yes.

367
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,631
They'll surely bless us.

368
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,439
Are you really going to live
in school dormitories?

369
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,959
Shall I rent you an apartment?

370
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,560
No, thanks.

371
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,199
I've made an agreement with the school.

372
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,479
I'd better not break it.

373
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,880
Can I see you tomorrow?

374
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,000
I don't think so.

375
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,950
Mr. Pei is my respected teacher.

376
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,325
On arriving in Peking,

377
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:27,405
I should first visit him.

378
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:29,974
Let me go with you.

379
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,160
What's the point of you going with me?

380
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,710
Think of me as your partner.

381
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,920
Let's visit your teacher together.

382
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,861
Be good.

383
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,280
When I settle down in two days,

384
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
I'll see you.

385
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,275
OK.

386
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,359
Mr. Pei.

387
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,640
Shizhen.

388
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,920
Mr. Pei.

389
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,000
Long time no see.

390
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,280
Shizhen.

391
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,895
You finally come.

392
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Since we received your telegram,

393
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,150
we've been looking forward
to your arrival.

394
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:43,794
I miss you and Mrs. Pei very much.

395
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,876
I've brought you
some gifts from Shanghai.

396
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,319
Come on.

397
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,239
- Get inside.
- OK.

398
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,280
You're welcome any time.

399
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,650
You don't have to bring any gifts.

400
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,479
Mrs. Pei, it's just a token.

401
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,350
I dare not forget

402
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,590
Mr. Pei's instruction.

403
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,164
Shizhen,

404
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,890
have you reported

405
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,835
to the school?

406
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,390
Not yet.

407
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,725
Thank you, sir, for finding me the job.

408
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
It's just in time.

409
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,790
Your senior resigned

410
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,079
for getting married.

411
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,266
The school

412
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,664
is short of hands

413
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,030
during the final exam.

414
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,710
You come just in time.

415
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,025
We should

416
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,316
thank you instead.

417
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,199
No, no, Mr. Pei.

418
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,800
All right.

419
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,239
Don't stand on ceremony.

420
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,760
Teachers should help their students.

421
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,675
Thank you, sir.

422
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:31,425
Yeah.

423
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:33,215
- Mrs. Pei, you...
- The strawberries are washed.

424
00:30:35,275 --> 00:30:36,074
Shizhen,

425
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:37,415
let me introduce him.

426
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:39,160
He is my student's cousin.

427
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,075
He is on a business trip to Peking.

428
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,650
He comes to visit us specially.

429
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,775
Nice to see you, Miss Feng.

430
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:46,525
I'm Rong Jiashang.

431
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,495
Hello, Mr. Rong.

432
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,345
Have some strawberries.

433
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,250
I just washed them.

434
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:54,754
Thanks.

435
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,839
Shizhen,

436
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,359
you're not getting any younger.

437
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,599
Have you considered

438
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,079
the main affair of your life?

439
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,040
Mrs. Pei, I don't worry about it.

440
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,640
How could you?

441
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
You're not very young.

442
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,599
You come to Peking alone this time.

443
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,000
It won't do if there is no one
taking care of you.

444
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,520
When you get on well with your work,

445
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,479
find a good man

446
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,920
and build a family.

447
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,500
Mrs. Pei.

448
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,100
Yeah.

449
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,675
Miss Feng may have a sweetheart already.

450
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,400
Mr. Rong, do you know me so well
the first time you see me?

451
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:29,944
I guessed blindly.

452
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,069
Miss Feng, no offense.

453
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,625
If you ask me,

454
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,319
I'd say Shizhen is a good girl.

455
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,765
Whoever marries her

456
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:39,425
will be lucky.

457
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:41,425
Right?

458
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,800
Mr. Pei, I have to go.

459
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,925
Take care.

460
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,875
OK. Goodbye.

461
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,575
OK.

462
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:01,800
Please go back.

463
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,800
Mr. Pei.

464
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,175
I'm leaving, too.

465
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,469
Take care.

466
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,725
See you.

467
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,650
Miss Feng.

468
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,119
I didn't know

469
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,560
you knew Mr. Pei, too.

470
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:26,546
Did you forget?

471
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:28,494
Yang Xiucheng was also
Mr. Pei's student.

472
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:30,160
Isn't it reasonable

473
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,439
that I visit his teacher for him?

474
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,194
You've got many tricks.

475
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,040
Sir, do you want flowers?

476
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,800
I want all your flowers.

477
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:55,985
Keep the change

478
00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:57,226
and buy yourself a new pair of shoes.

479
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,801
Thank you.

480
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,359
Wish you wealthy, prestigious

481
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,479
and live together till old.

482
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,450
Go home.

483
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah.

484
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,600
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

485
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,781
Here.

486
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:19,400
Thanks.

487
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,425
Shizhen.

488
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:37,325
I want to make you a promise.

489
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:39,775
But I'm not

490
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:42,305
confident enough to fulfill it now.

491
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:44,075
I'm not making excuses.

492
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:46,766
I'm too young.

493
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm not strong enough

494
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,241
to carry all the burdens for you.

495
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:51,526
I...

496
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:57,585
I've been thinking about it recently.

497
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:00,636
I don't want to disappoint you.

498
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,300
You've given me too much.

499
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,130
But I find

500
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,225
I have nothing to return you.

501
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,750
I want to give you many things.

502
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,725
I want to give you everything I have.

503
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,625
Shizhen.

504
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:17,835
I want you to be happy.

505
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:19,525
I want you to be blissful.

506
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,499
I'm not like my father.

507
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,200
I mean it.

508
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,525
After what has happened,

509
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,625
I know now.

510
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,600
Actually,

511
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,425
I don't want any promises from you.

512
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,700
I already have

513
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:48,426
what I really want.

514
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,390
What's that?

515
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,151
You.

516
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,919
Do you know?

517
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,280
When I

518
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:03,834
first met you
at the New Metropolis Club,

519
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,114
I was thinking,

520
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,120
what a wonderful thing it would be

521
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,040
to fall in love

522
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,110
with such an elegant young man!

523
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:12,965
At that time,

524
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:15,705
you were like a ray of light
shining on a snow mountain.

525
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,250
And now,

526
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:19,050
I'm bathed in the light.

527
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,625
What else do I need?

528
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:25,800
What do you see in me?

529
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,600
I just have a good appearance

530
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,975
and a dirty family business.

531
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,075
I don't think I'm good enough for you.

532
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:38,845
I think you're intelligent

533
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,260
and upstanding,

534
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,630
with affection and faith.

535
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,475
Jiashang,

536
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,750
you are meant to achieve something.

537
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,131
I'm not talking
about your family business.

538
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,215
You'll make different contributions

539
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:55,000
and create

540
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,891
your own career.

541
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,750
Shizhen.

542
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
Of course,

543
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,261
if you were not so good-looking,

544
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:06,800
I wouldn't have taken risks

545
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:09,050
saving you from the Meng Family.

546
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
So,

547
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,760
if I lose charm with years,

548
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,199
your affection
will be passed to another?

549
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,115
Probably.

550
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,679
Mr. Jiashang,

551
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,719
you should know,

552
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:24,064
women are

553
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,550
unpredictable.

554
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,325
Shizhen.

555
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:45,975
I love you.

556
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:51,875
I love you, too.

557
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,100
Nothing in the world

558
00:36:57,275 --> 00:36:58,835
is constant.

559
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,950
What we can do

560
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,225
is to live life to its fullest
every day.

561
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,369
As for other things,

562
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,350
let's resign to whatever fate awaits us.

563
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,000
Shizhen.

564
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,225
♪That light is bright♪

565
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:55,850
♪I try hard to see it♪

566
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,000
♪It's full of regrets♪

567
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:02,275
♪The night sky is full of stars♪

568

how magnificent an empire used to be,
