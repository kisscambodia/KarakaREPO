00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 40=

3
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,680
I'm getting married.

4
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,680
Unexpectedly,

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,199
I can only live in this family
for 16 years.

6
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,199
When I think more of it,

7
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,575
I've actually lived here for 16 years.

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,120
It's quite a long time.

9
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,680
So,

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,959
you should look forward to a new life.

11
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,760
You and Yunchi

12
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,879
will live in a new house

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
and enjoy a totally different scenery.

14
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:07,879
Try to

15
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,515
live a totally different life.

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,525
Can we?

17
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,160
Will Yunchi think

18
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,150
I'm a burden to him?

19
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,119
Silly girl,

20
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,240
you're not a burden to anyone.

21
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,119
Do you remember our dreams?

22
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,955
I want to learn economics

23
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,240
and you want to study medicine.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,400
We swore to be new women,

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
strong and independent.

26
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,919
We would have our own jobs,

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,600
instead of being someone's wife

28
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,350
or someone's mother.

29
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,550
Mm.

30
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,759
Even if you get married,

31
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,500
don't give up your dream.

32
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,075
We should work hard together

33
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:47,160
and live a wonderful life.

34
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:48,850
We aren't an appendage to anyone.

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,375
We won't be a burden to anyone, either.

36
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,650
Fine.

37
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,750
All right.

38
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,000
Time to dress you up,

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,360
bride.

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,200
Master, this long gown

41
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:10,479
makes you quite wealthy.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,725
You look much better, too.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,825
(Wedding)

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,479
I never expected

45
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,796
that Rong Fanghua could be
your first daughter

46
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,870
to get married.

47
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,030
Actually,

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,250
since she was born,

49
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,300
I've been worried about her marriage.

50
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,751
She isn't lucky enough

51
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,790
to be Ma'am's daughter

52
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,400
as a lineal daughter.

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,800
Because of me...

54
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:47,880
Because of me,

55
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:52,279
she's often mocked and sidelined
by those ladies.

56
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,100
When she has such a good husband,

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,650
I'm kind of relieved.

58
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,585
Master,

59
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,600
all I want now is one thing.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,580
I'll take care of you

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,575
and live a good life with you.

62
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,440
Fanghua is a lucky girl.

63
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:18,550
She's the luckiest of our family.

64
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,500
My children have grown up

65
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,389
and they're ambitious.

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,681
They all want to leave.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
Master,

68
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:34,760
as long as you're home,

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,200
however far

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,119
they go away,

71
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,050
they have to come back.

72
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,440
Now,

73
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,119
you should take care

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,875
and get well.

75
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,200
Maybe

76
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,290
by this time of year,

77
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,239
we can have a grandson.

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,279
I want to go out and have a look.

79
00:04:59,025 --> 00:04:59,984
All right.

80
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,400
How time flies!

81
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,525
I remember when you were little,

82
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,820
you were just a baby.

83
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:29,595
But now,

84
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,050
you're getting married.

85
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
This is my most precious
pair of earrings.

86
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:39,850
I'm giving it to you.

87
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,430
I want you

88
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,975
to have a wonderful wedding.

89
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,079
When you marry Yunchi,

90
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,850
you'll be his legal wife.

91
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,565
You won't be like me.

92
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,679
Mother.

93
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:56,514
It's all right.

94
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,225
Yunchi is a good man.

95
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,504
He's been taking much trouble

96
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:06,375
to marry you as his legal wife.

97
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,279
Remember,

98
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,425
when you live with him,

99
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,685
make more concessions.

100
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,075
I will.

101
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:21,519
Don't be too fussy.

102
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,596
Living a peaceful life
will be good enough.

103
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you get it?

104
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,050
I get it.

105
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,200
All right.

106
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,050
Stop crying.

107
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:41,550
Or you won't look beautiful.

108
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,250
I want you

109
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,241
to be the most beautiful bride.

110
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,119
Jiashang,

111
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:03,175
what's wrong?

112
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:16,075
This is the evidence
of my father's crimes over the years.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,399
After the wedding is over,

114
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,000
make it known to the public.

115
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:26,600
Jiashang,

116
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,725
have you made up your mind?

117
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,799
Now that it's known to the public,

118
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,640
your family will be doomed eternally.

119
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,100
This is what we deserve.

120
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,950
Since the day my father did evil,

121
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,479
this has been waiting for us.

122
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,461
Don't worry about me.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
Take good care of Fanghua.

124
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,004
I'll have everything arranged.

125
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,025
Mm.

126
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,400
Shixun,

127
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,119
I promised Fanghua I would go.

128
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,359
But you always hate such an occasion.

129
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,239
Don't force yourself to go with me.

130
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,750
Qin Shuigen is

131
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,719
such a cruel man.

132
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,640
I won't be relieved
if you go to his house alone.

133
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,475
It's just a wedding.

134
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,775
A lot of guests are there.

135
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,475
He doesn't dare to hurt me.

136
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:45,880
Besides,

137
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm not going to let him go.

138
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:49,850
After Fanghua's wedding is over,

139
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,880
I'll make him pay for everything.

140
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,650
Shizhen,

141
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,080
you don't need
to take all the responsibilities.

142
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,599
I'm your brother.

143
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,440
I'll protect you.

144
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,520
Shixun.

145
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,400
(Wedding)
Distinguished guests,

146
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,640
(Wedding)
ladies and gentlemen,

147
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,770
we're here today

148
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,599
for the wedding

149
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,239
of Mr. Wu Yunchi

150
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,975
and Miss Rong Fanghua.

151
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,200
Let's bless them

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
and be their witness.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,359
Mr. Wu Yunchi,

154
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,559
do you take

155
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,679
Miss Rong Fanghua to be your wife

156
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,950
and stay together

157
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,520
throughout

158
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,900
from this day on,

159
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,320
for richer or for poorer,

160
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,930
in sickness and in health,

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
as long as you both shall live?

162
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,359
Do you?

163
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,875
I do.

164
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:52,726
Miss Rong Fanghua,

165
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,544
do you take

166
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,559
Mr. Wu Yunchi to be your husband

167
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,120
and stay together throughout with him,

168
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,400
in sickness and in health,

169
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,280
for richer or for poorer,

170
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,800
as long as you both shall live?

171
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,119
Do you?

172
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,175
I do.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,475
I now announce

174
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,116
Mr. Wu Yunchi

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,250
and Miss Rong Fanghua

176
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,850
husband and wife.

177
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,280
Let's applaud

178
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,700
to bless them.

179
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,080
They look like a perfect couple.

180
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:24,799
Great couple.

181
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,550
Mr. Meng,

182
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,229
must we make Qin Shuigen

183
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,236
and Xiaojiu reunite today?

184
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
On such a happy day,
good things should come in pairs.

185
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,719
How do you know

186
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,318
Qin Shuigen wouldn't like

187
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:19,364
such an obedient son like Xiaojiu

188
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,564
after he experienced how disobedient

189
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:22,050
Rong Jiashang was?

190
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,050
- Master.
- Fanghua is quite a good girl.

191
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,253
You taught her well.

192
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,878
It's the luck of our family.

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,239
Excuse me,

194
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,559
- I've got some business.
- Yunchi is an excellent man, too.

195
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,479
I'll leave you alone.

196
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,080
- Sure. As you wish.
- You flatter him.

197
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,400
I'll count on you

198
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,400
for Fanghua's happy life.

199
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,125
Rest assured.

200
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,301
You're so lucky
to have such an excellent son

201
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,975
as Yunchi.

202
00:12:58,975 --> 00:12:59,769
Yeah.

203
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,080
You flatter him, Ma'am.

204
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,225
Thank you for the compliment.

205
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,559
Get him in.

206
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,159
Come in.

207
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,670
It's you?

208
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,725
Mr. Rong,

209
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,925
forgive me for coming
without invitation.

210
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:12,254
However,

211
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,406
I can't help feeling uneasy

212
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
unless I ask you something.

213
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,605
I know

214
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,320
what you want to ask.

215
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,119
If you want to blame someone,

216
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,440
don't blame me.

217
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,156
Blame your sister instead.

218
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,300
Because of her,

219
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,200
I had to do that.

220
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,700
But what did it have to do
with Sun Shaolan?

221
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,719
She offered to help

222
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,799
and I should let her be.

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,721
That woman!

224
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:48,325
She was my concubine
and had a son for me.

225
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,320
But she liked another man.

226
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,520
My sister always says

227
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,875
that you're good at
making irresponsible remarks

228
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,395
and confusing right and wrong.

229
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,225
When I hear you now,

230
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,200
I find you true to your name.

231
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,125
Mr. Rong.

232
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,280
Oh, no.

233
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,960
Mr. Qin.

234
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,280
Can you make everything right

235
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,825
in this world

236
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,000
as long as it's beneficial to you,

237
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,440
whether it's actually right or wrong?

238
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,300
And you can sound so unflinching?

239
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,775
It's a pity
that you aren't a politician.

240
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,039
What else do you want to say?

241
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:40,895
If nothing else,

242
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:43,450
I have another visitor to meet.

243
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,516
I'm your last visitor.

244
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,625
Shizhen.

245
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:21,675
Fanghua looks gorgeous today.

246
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,975
The bride is always the most beautiful.

247
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,989
If you wear a wedding dress,

248
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:32,646
you'll look gorgeous, too.

249
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,250
I know

250
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,050
my father cannot be excused.

251
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,005
But he brought me up, after all.

252
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:43,445
When the wedding is over,

253
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:44,450
I'll try my best

254
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,650
to uphold justice for you.

255
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,200
Qin Shuigen and I

256
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,080
have bothered each other for too long.

257
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,440
I don't want it

258
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,840
and I shouldn't get you involved.

259
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
But an end

260
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,275
must be put to it sooner or later.

261
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,825
Mr. Jiashang,

262
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,150
Meng Xiaojiu has been sent to Master.

263
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,440
All right.

264
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,880
Make Xiaojiu and your father reunite?

265
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,119
He traveled across the sea back
to see his father.

266
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,769
As blood is thicker than water,

267
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,425
I'll certainly make his dream come true.

268
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:15,400
After all, when my father gave an order,

269
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,100
he never cared whether others wanted it.

270
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,871
As his son,

271
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:20,875
I'm just learning it from him.

272
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,675
What's wrong?

273
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,319
Where's my brother?

274
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:28,199
Where will they reunite?

275
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,800
Room 6309 on the third floor.

276
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,520
Dr. Feng just asked me about it, too.

277
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,959
I then confirmed it.

278
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:33,880
Oh, no.

279
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,000
Shizhen!

280
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,225
I'm a doctor.

281
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,750
I can't use a gun,

282
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,050
but a scalpel.

283
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,520
Mr. Rong,

284
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,150
if you cooperate,

285
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,604
I can make you die without much pain.

286
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,959
Master, Meng Xiaojiu has arrived.

287
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,225
Let them leave.

288
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,375
Let him leave. I don't see anyone.

289
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,640
Daddy,

290
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,760
are you feeling unwell?

291
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,440
I'll ask Jiashang
to find a doctor for you.

292
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,160
I'll just have some sleep.

293
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,640
Don't bother.

294
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:19,100
You may leave.

295
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,125
Shixun!

296
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,075
Shixun,

297
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,925
don't do stupid things.

298
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,551
Shizhen, he killed so many people
in Wenchunli.

299
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,550
He got Sun Shaolan killed.

300
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:39,385
He killed your family.

301
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,640
Shizhen,

302
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,961
I won't let him hurt you again.

303
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,375
He deserves to be killed!

304
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,835
He certainly does.

305
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:50,040
But I don't want his blood to stain you.

306
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:51,400
Shixun,

307
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:52,959
you should use your hands
to save people,

308
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,319
instead of killing people.

309
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,760
Dr. Feng,

310
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,880
calm down.

311
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,250
Tomorrow, everyone in Shanghai will know

312
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,239
the crimes my father did.

313
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,725
I've given all the evidence
to the newspaper.

314
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
If you kill him now,

315
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,925
you'll only ruin yourself.

316
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,199
Qin Shuigen has done all kinds of evil.

317
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
He'll be punished.

318
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm more eager to kill him than you!

319
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,097
But we can't sacrifice

320
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:14,500
your future and life.

321
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,680
Li is in a coma.

322
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,520
You, Father, and Mother are
the only family I have.

323
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,746
Will you really leave me alone?

324
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,400
Dr. Feng.

325
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,625
Shixun,

326
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,875
I beg you.

327
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,359
Shixun.

328
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:52,100
Jiashang!

329
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,200
Jiashang, are you all right?

330
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,900
Jiashang!

331
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,119
Jiashang.

332
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,350
Where were you shot?

333
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,800
Thank you for saving me again.

334
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,150
Don't move.

335
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,000
Be careful!

336
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:19,160
Nobody moves!

337
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,280
Qin Shuigen.

338
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,975
Get up.

339
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,760
Shizhen.

340
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,560
Don't move.

341
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,640
Or I'll kill her.

342
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,040
Qin Shuigen,

343
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,079
your legs...

344
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,119
Son,

345
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:33,566
do you think only you have schemes?

346
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,791
You think you can control everything

347
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,725
just by putting me under house arrest?

348
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,050
You're not experienced enough.

349
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,100
Dingkun,

350
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,745
this is the magic medicine
from a German doctor.

351
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,760
It'll enable you to stand for a quarter
in an emergency.

352
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,680
Then it'll be invalid.

353
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,125
Use it cautiously.

354
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,596
Hua'an, you know me very well.

355
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,250
Father,

356
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,900
calm down.

357
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,199
I can give you whatever you want.

358
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,425
Whatever I want?

359
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:11,275
I want to kill this woman!

360
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,600
You keep saying
I'm not caring enough.

361
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,825
Now I'll show you

362
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,359
how a caring father

363
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,959
kills the woman who ruined his family.

364
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:25,439
If you kill her,

365
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,400
I'll die with her!

366
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,079
Do you want this mad boy

367
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,079
to be your heir?

368
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,199
Daddy.

369
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:32,900
Don't call me Daddy.

370
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,680
Why would Qingzhi have such a freak son?

371
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,550
This freak is your own son.

372
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,719
Qin Shuigen,

373
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,599
what a loser you are!

374
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:46,359
I guess you have no way out

375
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,000
and you even have to seize a woman.

376
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,650
What?

377
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,079
How does it feel
to be deserted by everyone?

378
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,920
Who knows where you got this boy?

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't make me the father of such a boy.

380
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,250
Such a boy?

381
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,400
Looks like you're too old

382
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,079
to see clearly.

383
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:05,500
Fine.

384
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,050
Let me push him closer

385
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,825
so that you can look more clearly.

386
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,300
Don't come over, Meng Xu'an!

387
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,199
Stay away!

388
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,160
Look carefully.

389
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,160
You'd better look clearly.

390
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,900
Stay away!

391
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,650
- Look at his face!
- I said, stay away!

392
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:36,514
Shizhen!

393
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,250
(No one expected)

394
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,225
(that Rong Dingkun died like this.)

395
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:48,000
Jiashang.

396
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,175
(After all,
he aroused all the disputes.)

397
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,640
(He's the stubbornest,)

398
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,119
(like a tumor
that can never be got rid of.)

399
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:01,535
(Feels like)

400
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,079
(an old devil like him
can still fight the young guys)

401
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,025
(for a long time.)

402
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:09,000
(They'll be too tired to fight back)

403
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,375
(but still fail to get rid of him.)

404
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,831
(Ye he died so unexpectedly.)

405
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,980
(A scarf)

406
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,640
(broke his neck easily.)

407
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,825
(He died a quick and complete death.)

408
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,451
(What left behind is)

409
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,670
(luck, fear,)

410
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,920
(and a heavy sigh.)

411
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:39,994
(All present are a bit confused)

412
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,599
(as if hot-blooded warriors)

413
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,239
(suddenly lost their target of battle.)

414
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,725
(They couldn't believe)

415
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,479
(this was how)

416
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,319
(the battle ended.)

417
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:58,350
(Later, they regained consciousness)

418
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,975
(and accepted what happened.)

419
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,025
(From the bottom of their hearts,)

420
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,825
(they even heaved a sigh of relief.)

421
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,125
Don't worry, Father.

422
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,025
Be careful during your trip.

423
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,230
Remember to write to us.

424
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,560
(Bund Passenger Terminal)

425
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,800
After you arrive,

426
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,350
you must take good care of yourself.

427
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,510
Write to me, remember?

428
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,040
I will, Mother.

429
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,599
I'll just go there for education.

430
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,160
I'll be back soon.

431
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,640
Besides,

432
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,675
Fanghua and Yunchi will go with me.

433
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,425
What can still make you worried?

434
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:42,975
Mm.

435
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,280
Don't worry.

436
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
I'll be there.

437
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,550
I'll take good care of them.

438
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,269
I'll leave them to you.

439
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:51,584
Thank you, Yunchi.

440
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,479
Ma'am and I will move

441
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:02,525
to the residence in Nanjing.

442
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:03,125
Mm.

443
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,160
Remember to come back and visit me.

444
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,119
And remember

445
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,839
this is your maternal family.

446
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,560
I will, Mother.

447
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,651
All right.

448
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:13,363
Write to us when you arrive.

449
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:14,225
Rest assured.

450
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,479
Don't be sad anymore.

451
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,800
Don't be too tired.

452
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,760
Take care.

453
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,560
The same to you.

454
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,050
Always keep warm.

455
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:23,880
Come on.

456
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,040
You've grown up

457
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,280
and you should be sensible.

458
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,160
Study hard after you arrive.

459
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,839
Remember what Miss Feng taught you.

460
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:33,275
Mm.

461
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,079
Jiashang,

462
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,500
I heard

463
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,599
Miss Feng would leave, too.

464
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,975
Will you really not meet her?

465
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,925
After so many accidents,

466
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,800
she and I

467
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,230
need some time to calm down.

468
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,235
It's good for us.

469
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,250
If you hadn't made a statement
in the newspaper

470
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,280
and made Father's crimes
known to the public,

471
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,600
I wouldn't know...

472
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:02,905
Stop thinking about it.

473
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,900
It has nothing to do with you.

474
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,475
In our family,

475
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,125
no one else needs

476
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,160
to be responsible for his sins.

477
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
As for Shizhen and me...

478
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,925
Time brings all things to pass.

479
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,046
Maybe

480
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,119
she and I will meet during our trips.

481
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,125
Take care.

482
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,975
Mm.

483
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,880
Be careful on your way.

484
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,681
Ma'am will miss you, too.

485
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:30,450
Mm.

486
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,825
- When you're free, call us.
- Mm.

487
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:47,920
Take care.

488
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,680
Take care.

489
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,400
Go back home.

490
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,650
I will, Mother.

491
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,175
Take care.

492
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:52,760
Yunchi.

493
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,839
- Mother, take care, too.
- See you.

494
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,000
- Take good care of yourself.
- I will.

495
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,239
- Take care, bro.
- Take care.

496
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,400
- Don't worry.
- Write to me often.

497
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,900
- Be very careful.
- See you.

498
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,850
Take good care of my sister.

499
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,450
Mm.

500
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,199
Be careful during the trip.

501
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,100
Off you go.

502
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:06,600
- Take care.
- Go back home. Go.

503
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:07,743
See you.

504
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:10,725
Remember to write to me.

505
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:11,920
- Farewell, Mother.
- Farewell.

506
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,050
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

507
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,479
Farewell.

508
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,359
Farewell.

509
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:16,551
- Don't know when we can meet again.
- Farewell.

510
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,975
- Ticket, please.
- Farewell.

511
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:18,975
Farewell.

512
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,280
Ticket, please.

513
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,275
Remember to write back.

514
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:22,975
Go ahead.

515
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,079
- Farewell, Mother.
- Farewell, Mother.

516
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:24,880
Go back home.

517
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,300
(Bund Passenger Terminal)
I'm leaving, then.

518
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,025
(Bund Passenger Terminal)
I'll write to you after I arrive.

519
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:27,725
(Bund Passenger Terminal)
Write to us after you arrive.

520
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:28,359
(Bund Passenger Terminal)
Let's go.

521
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,800
- Take care!
- Take care!

522
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,075
Be careful during the trip.

523
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,325
- Farewell.
- Remember to write back.

524
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:36,000
Farewell.

525
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:50,750

526
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:57,475

528
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,880
The Club is still so lively.

529
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,325
What's your plan for the future?

530
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,800
I've taken revenge.

531
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,785
Wen woke up, too.

532
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:40,835
I discussed it with Shixun

533
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,599
and I'm going to move to Peking
with my family.

534
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:45,816
Peking?

535
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,280
Shixun wants to run a clinic there.

536
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,719
I can still serve as a teacher.

537
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,215
I'll also have more time

538
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,925
to stay with Wen.

539
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,075
He and I

540
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,850
have lost too much time.

541
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:14,835
You'll forget everything in Shanghai

542
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,325
and start afresh.

543
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,014
Mr. Meng,

544
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,359
thank you for taking care of me
over the years.

545
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,150
I'll never forget

546
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,425
what you've done for me.

547
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,755
Being remembered by you

548
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:45,624
is good enough for me.

549
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,775
Take care.

550
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,075
Take care.

551
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:42,906
Mr. Meng,

552
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,250
why didn't you ask her to stay?

553
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:48,634
You care about her, anyway.

it's getting very hot in Guangzhou.

I want you to come here,

such hot weather.

621

Today, I finally passed the exam.

622
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,290
It occurred to me

623
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,620
that three years ago,

624
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,719
I met you

625
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,879

626
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:35,500

I wonder if you can still recognize me.

By the way,

631
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,675
I got Moon Cake to my dorm, too.

641
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,109
you're living quite a casual life.

642

Unless I call you,

643
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:41,479
you never call me to ask

644
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,821
about your family business.

645
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900

646

647
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,296
Don't flatter me.

648
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,600
You left me such an awful mess.

649

I wouldn't interfere.

652
00:39:58,175 --> 00:39:59,425
when will you come back?

653
00:39:59,425 --> 00:40:00,399
In a while.

654
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,879
I'll take over your business, then.

655
