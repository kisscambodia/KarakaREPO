00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,500
=City of Streamer=

2
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:41,519
You made a good point.

4
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
Dog doesn't eat dog.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,440
By then, you'll know

6
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,975
you can't vindicate yourself

7
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:50,825
simply by killing all witnesses.

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,100
Who would be intimate friends

9
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,900
with someone that killed
his wife and children?

10
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,879
And who

11
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,369
would be his relatives by marriage?

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,199
People do dangerous business

13
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,400
because they want to make money
for their wives and children

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
so that they can live a good life.

15
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,600
But such a ruthless man like you

16
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
is one of a kind through the ages.

17
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,950
You came to avenge your sister?

18
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,360
I'm here

19
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,000
to let your family reunite.

20
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,300
Make yourself at home.

21
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,475
Concubine Sun.

22
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:15,835
Why are you sitting here?

23
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,525
Do you think it's proper for you
to show up on such an occasion?

24
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,039
Can't I come to

25
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,520
Mr. Jiashang's birthday banquet?

26
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Just look around.

27
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,125
There are all lawful wives.

28
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:30,500
Is it appropriate for you to be here?

29
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,240
Should I introduce you to the guests

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,919
that you are a concubine
of the Rong family?

31
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,100
Come on.

32
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,325
Come with me.

33
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,981
Come on.

34
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,199
No need.

35
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,119
Make yourself at home.

36
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:58,919
Don't be reserved.

37
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,825
Aunt.

38
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,675
Eh!

39
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:01,800
Zhihui.

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,875
Your emerald necklace
is really beautiful.

41
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,279
It makes you look elegant and noble.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
I can't take my eyes off.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,750
Really?

44
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:08,650
Mm!

45
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,199
You're so sweet.

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
Why are you here alone?

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,875
Where is Xiucheng?

48
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,920
I don't know where he is.

49
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:22,825
Men are the same.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,125
They always want more.

51
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm a person of my word.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,880
I'll find you a better man today.

53
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,519
Believe me, you won't lose anything.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,641
Come with me.

55
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,950
Come on.

56
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,279
Fanglin.

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,160
Miss Feng.

58
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,559
I've been looking for you.

59
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:44,839
You talk first.

60
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,720
I'll look around.

61
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,079
Okay, Shixun.

62
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,450
Miss Feng.

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Did you see Xiucheng?

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,359
Mr. Yang?

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,559
Isn't he with Miss Yu?

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,320
Miss Yu?

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,279
She is busy joking
with Secretary Chen's son

68
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,279
and having a great time.

69
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,040
How would she have time for others?

70
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,760
She pretends to be so demure

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
in front of Xiucheng,

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,760
but in fact,
she flirts with men all the time.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,079
It's between them.

74
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,880
There is nothing we can do.

75
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,799
Mr. Yang is an assertive man.

76
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,679
I believe he will make his own decision.

77
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,600
Miss Feng, do you know

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,081
that Miss Hashimoto

79
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,959
used to be Jiashang's girlfriend

80
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,500
when he was in Chongqing?

81
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,480
I was there
when they recognized each other.

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,525
It was fun.

83
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,679
It turns out
that they both used fake names

84
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,040
when they were in Chongqing.

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,239
I know, right?

86
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,720
Now Jiashang

87
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,359
met his ex-girlfriend again,

88
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:40,496
but he has a fiancée now.

89
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,920
Actually,

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,359
I kind of like Miss Hashimoto,

91
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:47,200
but she is no match for Lanxin.

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,801
I don't think she will win.

93
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,559
Doesn't your brother
have any ideas of his own?

94
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,040
Miss Hashimoto's family seems good, too.

95
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,839
It's suitable

96
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,160
for your family.

97
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,519
Jiashang doesn't care about it.

98
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,000
No matter who he marries,

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
he will always live in ease and comfort.

100
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,525
Miss Feng, I'll go down first.

101
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,679
Mm, go ahead.

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,875
Come in.

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,119
Uncle.

104
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,679
What's wrong?

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,200
Send people to look into

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,325
Meng Xu'an

107
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,720
and Yongli Bank now.

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,679
Yongli...

109
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,720
It was founded two years ago

110
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,000
and has a good relationship
with the government.

111
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,600
It also has connections with the gangs.

112
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,519
But it never got involved in any case
or negative news.

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,160
I applied for a loan
from the bank before

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,200
but was rejected.

115
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,880
He turns out to be the one behind this.

116
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,279
He is not easy to deal with.

117
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,079
Send people to keep an eye on him

118
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,559
and report to me immediately
if you find anything.

119
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,950
Yes.

120
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
All right, go to greet the guests first.

121
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,799
Miss Feng.

122
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:02,784
Boss.

123
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,559
I didn't see you

124
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,975
and I thought you were gone.

125
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,480
Don't be so serious.

126
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Have a smile.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
I just have

128
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,760
a thick skin.

129
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,959
Mr. Rong

130
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,559
intends to send me out,

131
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,600
but I choose

132
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,839
to stay anyway.

133
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,160
The birthday banquet
of Rong Dingkun's son

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
is a big event in Shanghai.

135
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:25,959
It would be a pity

136
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,720
if I missed it,

137
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,600
right?

138
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,000
Cheers.

139
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,000
Doesn't it matter

140
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,200
if anyone sees us talking here?

141
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,320
Of course not.

142
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,719
You're young and beautiful.

143
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,559
I'm attracted by you,
and I come to talk to you.

144
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,799
What's wrong with that?

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,119
By the way,

146
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,080
I've taken care of Guo Dazhuang.

147
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't worry.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,479
Your identity is still safe.

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
He...

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,080
He's still alive.

151
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,440
It's just

152
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,799
that Rong Jiashang has been
tracking the clue of Foundling Home

153
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,239
and looking into it again and again.

154
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,475
I lost a few

155
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,799
able man.

156
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,479
Miss Feng, what kind of books
do you like to read?

157
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,000
I like western adventure novels

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
and detective fictions.

159
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,400
What a coincidence.

160
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,359
I have a detective fiction

161
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,679
which is really popular this year.

162
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,475
It was written
by a female writer called...

163
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:30,919
Agatha Christie.

164
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:33,320
Isn't she

165
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,519
Miss Feng's favorite female writer?

166
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,119
But this female writer
is not very famous.

167
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,359
It surprised me

168
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,440
that Mr. Meng also knows her.

169
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,719
I only know a little about her.

170
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,359
I don't know you like her, too.

171
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,320
I have a copy of the original edition.

172
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,640
I can give it to you

173
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,880
if you like.

174
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,119
The original edition is precious.

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,359
I can't take that from you.

176
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,280
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

177
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,119
You're welcome.

178
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,650
By the way,

179
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,599
I think it was 18 years ago

180
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,000
when I visited Rong's Residence.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
You were little at that time.

182
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,200
You definitely don't remember me.

183
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,039
I don't remember you.

184
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,760
But if you're interested,

185
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,919
I'll let the butler show you around.

186
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,400
No need, thanks.

187
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,559
As I recall now,

188
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,799
you were living in a small
Western-style building

189
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,359
when I first visited your family.

190
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,159
It was simple and unadorned.

191
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,799
Your father is capable indeed.

192
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,440
He used less than 20 years

193
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,426
to multiply his family business.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,479
But I'm thinking

195
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,559
that it must be really hard for you

196
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:37,880
to take on such a big family business

197
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
and such a huge responsibility alone.

198
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,159
It might be better

199
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:49,564
if you have a brother.

200
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,599
It's said that you revitalized

201
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,239
the decaying family business

202
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,400
with your own strength.

203
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,840
You didn't have any brothers
to help you, did you?

204
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,559
Do you think

205
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,775
my ability is far worse than yours?

206
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,119
No, no.

207
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,919
That's not what I mean.

208
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,600
Don't take me wrong.

209
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,200
There's one thing I know.

210
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
Don't look down on the poor young man.

211
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,599
It's too early to tell.

212
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm optimistic about you.

213
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,479
I look forward to your future.

214
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:22,400
Thank you.

215
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,080
You're welcome.

216
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,600
Men are slackers indeed.

217
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,500
The ball is about to start.

218
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,280
Why are you still
standing here chatting?

219
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,280
It's our fault

220
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,520
to snub the ladies.

221
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,719
I wonder if Miss Du

222
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,840
would like

223
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,799
to have a dance with me.

224
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,320
Why not?

225
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,440
Please.

226
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,760
Excuse me.

227
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,039
Miss Feng.

228
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,479
That man

229
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,239
has a feud with my family.

230
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,400
He isn't a friend.

231
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,145
You'd better stay away from him

232
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,880
lest you get involved in these affairs.

233
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:09,145
It's too late.

234
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,599
You seem to have
a lot of old friends here today.

235
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,200
Oh, right,

236
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,880
where is your Miss Hashimoto?

237
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,479
Isn't she chatting with them?

238
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:23,960
Besides,

239
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,020
she's not mine.

240
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,400
But she seems to care about you.

241
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,640
Miss Feng.

242
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:33,880
My relationship with her
is not what you think it is.

243
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,825
I know.

244
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,320
You sent her flowers

245
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,679
because you like her.

246
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,080
You sent me flowers

247
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,280
because you wanted to apologize.

248
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,719
Don't worry.

249
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,840
I won't take it wrong.

250
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:05,850
Bravo!

251
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,619
Miss Feng.

252
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,080
Miss Feng.

253
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,679
This is our second dance.

254
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,045
But I still can't figure it out.

255
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,111
What is it that you can't figure out?

256
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,725
Why did you invite me

257
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,941
to dance with you
in New Metropolis Club that day?

258
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,334
Why are you still thinking about this?

259
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,280
Because I can't think it through.

260
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:09,506
Today is my birthday.

261
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,174
Can you tell me the reason?

262
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,479
Tell me first

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,425
why you are so stubborn

264
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,424
about knowing the reason.

265
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
Is it because

266
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,094
I was the first one
to invite you to dance?

267
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,760
Even if I was the first one,

268
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,760
it was still just a dance.

269
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,200
Miss Feng.

270
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,159
For me,

271
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,760
it was more than a dance.

272
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,679
Do you really want to know why?

273
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,080
Rong Jiashang is a lovable man.

274
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,280
You were

275
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,679
having a big smile.

276
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,159
No one likes someone

277
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,599
with a sour face all day, right?

278
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,960
If I don't respond,

279
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,239
how would he open himself to me?

280
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,159
The fish is almost on the hook.

281
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,625
Boss.

282
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,359
They are all looking at us.

283
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,359
I know.

284
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,960
Let me remind you again.

285
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,960
Don't let the fish
drag you into the water.

286
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,375
Don't worry.

287
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,919
I know what I'm doing.

288
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,960
I won't have our plan affected.

289
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,330
Be careful, Shizhen.

290
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Don't forget

291
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,500
why you entered the Rong family
in the first place.

292
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,520
If you don't remember,

293
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,080
just think about your father.

294
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,799
Maybe he can sober you up.

295
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Besides,

296
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,280
Rong Jiashang

297
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:55,640
is the son of a wealthy family
in Shanghai.

298
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,850
But you...

299
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,000
But I'm just a poor governess.

300
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:02,559
I know

301
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,840
who I am.

302
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't need you to keep reminding me.

303
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,199
Looks like you're sober enough.

304
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,119
I can rest assured then.

305
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I really like the way you are.

306
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,575
You're stubborn,

307
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,079
but you have to give in.

308
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
There is one more thing

309
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,839
I find strange.

310
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,359
Rong Dingkun's

311
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,000
taste in women

312
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,040
never changed over these years,

313
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,560
but he doesn't like you.

314
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,760
His son likes me.

315
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,081
It's not that important

316
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,400
whether the father
likes me or not, right?

317
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,640
Right.

318
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,040
Stop being so sullen.

319
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,325
Take it easy.

320
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,560
It's a wonderful night,

321
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,920
and

322
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,950
you are beautiful, too.

323
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,691
Mr. Meng...

324
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,479
Mr. Meng

325
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,479
is a nosy man.

326
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,640
He asked about everything,

327
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,875
and his hands are strong.

328
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,359
I tried so hard to escape from him.

329
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:25,239
What did he ask you?

330
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,119
Just some ordinary stuff.

331
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,800
He asked me how I teach students

332
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,121
and if I get along with the Rong family.

333
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,560
Oh, right.

334
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:38,514
He also asked me about Miss Sun.

335
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,754
What did you tell him?

336
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,800
Don't worry, Mr. Yang.

337
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,959
I know the rules.

338
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,160
I never talk about
my employer's family affairs

339
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,199
with other people.

340
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,560
Moreover,

341
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,200
he's a slick guy.

342
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,525
I don't want to talk too much with him.

343
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,640
Anyway, Mr. Yang,

344
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,719
why didn't Miss Yu

345
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,160
come with you today?

346
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,200
When she came here to borrow a dress...

347
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,040
I'll take you there sometime.

348
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,800
Mm.

349
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,920
She mentioned
what happened between you two.

350
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:13,640
I can tell

351
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,400
that she has feelings for you.

352
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,880
That restaurant is great.

353
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,741
- I'll take you there.
- Yes.

354
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,041
- Did she borrow the dress from her aunt?
- Great.

355
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,565
Master Rong gave it to her.

356
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,640
I guess he was worried

357
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,439
that the Huang family would lose face

358
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,050
if Miss Yu didn't have a suitable dress
for such a big occasion.

359
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:35,319
Mr. Yang, don't you think

360
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,119
Miss Yu is particularly beautiful today?

361
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,040
What are you implying?

362
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:42,006
I think

363
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,646
you and Miss Yu

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
are a perfect match.

365
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,760
You'll look good together.

366
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,920
The fate

367
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,520
is not on our side.

368
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,959
I think

369
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,079
the best relationship in the world

370
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,560
is when two people grow up together

371
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,280
and stay with each other.

372
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,890
Fate needs

373
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,800
to be maintained sometimes.

374
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,280
You can try your best first

375
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,415
before you give up.

376
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,000
It's finally my turn.

377
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,079
Miss Feng, you are so pretty today.

378
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
It's like you're a different person now.

379
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,439
No matter how pretty I am,

380
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,319
it's only for one night.

381
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,119
After midnight,

382
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,640
I'll change back to myself.

383
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,599
You're graceful and elegant.

384
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,800
You don't look like
you will be poor forever.

385
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:50,175
Can you tell my fortune through my face?

386
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:52,359
When I get rich,

387
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,075
I'll send you a big gift.

388
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,520
Except for your face,

389
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,760
I can also see something else.

390
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,520
Miss Feng,

391
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,800
do you want to try it?

392
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,680
You're so...

393
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,760
Fierce?

394
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,215
Don't think that we don't know

395
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,400
how men talk about women
behind our backs.

396
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,225
No wonder Jiashang
is so obsessed with you.

397
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,959
Mr. Wu,

398
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,359
you'd better watch your words.

399
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,479
Otherwise,

400
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,319
you might be given a slap.

401
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,680
I can't live a day

402
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,800
without being

403
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,359
slapped by girls.

404
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,959
I really hope

405
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,439
you can give me a slap

406
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,090
with your delicate hand.

407
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,450
Mr. Meng, what are you looking at?

408
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm just wondering

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,280
where you borrowed

410
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,439
this dress.

411
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,359
Judging by your mannerisms,

412
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,400
you must still be a student.

413
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,079
I'm studying
at Ginling Women's University.

414
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,560
I love students.

415
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,079
They are obedient

416
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,160
and very simple.

417
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,560
Most importantly,

418
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:21,199
they are clean.

419
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,839
Maybe you should consider being with me.

420
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,040
At least,

421
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,719
I won't fool you with zircon

422
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,471
like Rong Dingkun did.

423
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:37,455
As a well-educated lady,

424
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:39,250
you're behaving inappropriately.

425
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:58,160
Mr. Meng is an interesting man indeed.

426
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,680
I thought he was
just an ordinary rich businessman.

427
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,969
But he's been hiding himself so well.

428
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,439
I think he came to Uncle Rong this time

429
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,359
probably

430
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,115
because he is up to something.

431
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,439
The Rong family
runs such a big business.

432
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,719
Will they be afraid of him?

433
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,959
There are so many banks in Shanghai.

434
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:16,925
Just don't do business with him.

435
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,930
I got you again.

436
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,961
Shizhen.

437
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,196
I won't let you go this time.

438
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,500
Have you decided?

439
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,319

Thank you for coming today.

481
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,875
My son has grown up.

482
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,125
It's time for him
to start his own family.

483
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,359
Our friendship with the Du family
spans for generations.

484
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,839
Miss Du is beautiful and smart,

485
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,959
considerate and sensible.

also like each other.

00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,625
Therefore, today...

Father!

491
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:17,700
Today...

492
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,199
I would like to announce to you

493
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,920
that the Rong family and the Du family

494
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,100
are about to become relatives
by marriage.

495
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,439
I hope you will be here

496
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:39,975
on the wedding day!

497
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,119
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

498
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:43,560
Come on.

499
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,640
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

500
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:48,325
Bravo!

501
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:21,800
- Put it on!
- Put it on!

502
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,125
- Jiashang, put it on!
- Bravo!

503
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:48,150
- Put it on!
- Put it on!

504
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:50,427
Excellent!

505
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,038
Bravo!

506
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,800
Bravo!

507
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,341
Excellent!

508
00:28:57,341 --> 00:29:00,550
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

509
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:02,135
Excellent!

510
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,575
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

511
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:11,800
What a perfect match.

512
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,250
Bravo!

513
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,650
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

514
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,575
Bravo!

515
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:26,775
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

516
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,199
You can cry

517
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,351
if you want to.

518
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,220
Why would I cry?

519
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:28,845
Actually, I already knew

520
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:31,760
that he would announce
their engagement today.

521
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,119
I saw their marriage contract

522
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,255
in Rong Dingkun's study before.

523
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,599
Rong Dingkun

524
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,160
lost the Nanyang Route

525
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,880
and opium den.

526
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,599
He won't sit still and do nothing.

527
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,839
The Du family

528
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,439
is wealthy,

529
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,499
and Mr. Du

530
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,811
is the next associate director
of customs.

531
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:58,239
It's such a lucrative deal.

532
00:30:58,475 --> 00:30:59,640
There is no way he wouldn't do it.

533
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,000
Anyway,

534
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,400
Rong Jiashang has a fiancée now.

535
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm afraid it won't be that easy for you

536
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:08,955
to get close to him.

537
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,994
Not only a fiancée,

538
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,561
Miss Hashimoto

539
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:15,839
was Rong Jiashang's girlfriend

540
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,400
when he was in Chongqing.

541
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:23,920
An ex-girlfriend

542
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,359
and a fiancée.

543
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,959
Rong Jiashang

544
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:28,715
is a lucky man

545
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,599
indeed.

546
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,150
You're in a bad situation.

547
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,199
There is no need to boost his morale.

548
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,599
If I can let Rong Jiashang

549
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,160
invite me back to the Rong family,

550
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,591
I will figure out a way

551
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,069
to keep him.

552
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,800
Even now the fish is on the hook,

553
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,359
it's still in the water.

554
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,801
Don't take it lightly.

555
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:03,900
Sure.

556
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,439
Our aim

557
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,640
is to get our work done

558
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,719
through him.

559
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,239
I never underestimated you.

560
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,450
After all,

561
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,839
you are my favorite student.

562
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,319
How about

563
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,199
let me give you a hand.

564
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,400
You need to know

565
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,159
that sometimes a man
needs some incentives

566
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,800

570
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,400
Stop fighting!

571
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,700
Good.

572
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,200
You're agile.

573
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,239
Have you practiced martial arts before?

574
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,479
I'll kill your whole family

575
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,439
if you come close to her again!

576
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,000
Rong Jiashang, what do you want to do?

577
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Are you done?

578
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,760
No!

579
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,200
Enough!

580
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,300
Miss Feng.

581
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,599
I told you

582
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,959
Meng Xu'an has ill intentions.

583
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,599
Why were you alone with him?

584
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,650
Did you listen to what I said?

585
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,410
Why should I listen to what you said?

586
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,880
Do I have to ask your permission

587
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,201
to meet someone?

588
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,520
He treated you frivolously.

589
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,439
Aren't you angry?

590
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,599
Of course, I'm angry,

591
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:02,326
but it's not your turn to scold me!

592
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,625
Let me go!

593
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:06,100
Miss Feng.

594
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,461
Do you like men like Meng Xu'an?

595
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,450
What are you trying to say?

596
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:17,496
I don't know what you're thinking.

597
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,695
What kind of man do you like?

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,175
Is it as old and mature as Meng Xu'an?

599
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,660
You're ridiculous.

600
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,800
I can do that, too.

601
