=Episode 33=

3
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,959
To enjoy the high position

4
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,000
and great wealth of our family,

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,600
they must take the responsibility
it comes with,

6
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,109
either making great efforts

7
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,421
or contributing themselves.

8
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,969
Our family

9
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,100
doesn't support useless people.

10
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,530
What about Mrs. Bai
who married you before my mother?

11
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,595
She bore a son and a daughter for you.

12
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:03,639
Just because she got in your way
of marrying up,

13
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,160
you must have
killed her and her children?

14
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,570
What did Zhao Hua'an tell you?

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,300
There seem to be
a lot of things he didn't tell me.

16
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:30,325
Is he

17
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,230
still seeing Ma'am?

18
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:37,755
I don't know.

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,919
If you want to know,

20
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,050
I can call her in.

21
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,440
That awful woman!

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,281
That awful woman!

23
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:49,525
I've had many women in my life.

24
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,071
Now I'm getting into such a plight.

25
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,965
Only your mother

26
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,351
was the nicest

27
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,300
and gentlest to me.

28
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,185
About Mrs. Bai,

29
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,376
it was complicated.

30
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,055
Zhao Hua'an and Huang Shujun

31
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,119
both have sinister motives

32
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,600
and harbor evil intentions.

33
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,035
Son.

34
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,875
You are my real

35
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:22,100
flesh and blood.

36
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:26,756
How can you turn against me
in cahoots with outsiders?

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,940
I'm not against you.

38
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,199
Father.

39
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:34,605
I'm saving you.

40
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,605
I'm correcting the past.

41
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,141
I'm making up for the past.

42
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:39,250
In the future, I don't want

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,479
another man like Meng Xu'an

44
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,679
to jump out at intervals

45
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,119
to wreak vengeance on us!

46
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,751
I want to smoke opium.

47
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,759
It's bad for your health.

48
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,240
I don't want to live long.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,125
No!

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
If you let me smoke,

51
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,075
I'll tell you

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,279
about Mrs. Bai.

53
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,550
Tell me.

54
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,790
After I married Bai,

55
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,600
I came to Shanghai to do business

56
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,120
and seldom went home.

57
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:04,119
Hating to be neglected,
she had an affair

58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,329
and had a son and a daughter
with a man.

59
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,175
I wouldn't acknowledge them,

60
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,489
so she took the children
and ran away with the man.

61
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:14,535
On their way…

62
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,200
On their way,

63
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,119
I don't know if they ran into bandits

64
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,675
or the man went back on his word.

65
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,019
Anyway,

66
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,100
they all got killed.

67
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,075
What about their children?

68
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,150
They all got killed.

69
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Just leave if you finished asking.

70
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:49,850
Don't bother me again.

71
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:34,395
Father.

72
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:53,414
Father.

73
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,230
Were Mrs. Bai's children

74
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,510
really not yours?

75
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,450
No.

76
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,959
Whose children were they?

77
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,469
They were Rong Dingkun's.

78
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,575
Then who are you?

79
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:18,975
I'm Rong Dingkun

80
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,951
from Guojia Town.

81
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,399
I was born on March 4, 1884.

82
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,250
My pet name was Guangge.

83
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,320
My father was Rong Youde.

84
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,929
I got it. Stop!

85
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,650
Father.

86
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,889
You mentioned before

87
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,736
that Mrs. Bai's children

88
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,175
were your brother's.

89
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:37,306
Where is he now?

90
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,475
Vanished.

91
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,650
I did it myself...

92
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,719
You'll never find him again.

93
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
What did you say?

94
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,925
Father.

95
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,425
What did you say?

96
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,215
What did you do?

97
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:07,305
Who was the man exactly?

98
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,630
He.

99
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,839
He.

100
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,025
He?

101
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,490
You'll never find He again.

102
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,890
He.

103
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:30,250
You knew I was desperate.

104
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,211
Why didn't you help me?

105
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,760
If you made allowances for me,

106
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,919
I wouldn't have done that.

107
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,929
You made me do it!

108
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,946
You made me do it!

109
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,799
Father.

110
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,559
Who was He?

111
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,675
Who was He?

112
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,420
Father!

113
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,719
You made me do it…

114
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Give us a minute.

115
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,119
Yang Xiucheng is back.

116
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,400
He found the clue about…

117
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,760
about your parentage.

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,280
Hello, Miss Feng.

119
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,280
Miss Feng.

120
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,479
Long time no see.

121
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:13,775
Hello, Mr. Yang.

122
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:16,684
So,

123
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,894
take your time.

124
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,071
I'll leave you alone.

125
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,860
I must apologize

126
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,231
to you and your family
for what happened in Wenchunli.

127
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:38,095
I didn't mean
to act as the paws of the tiger,

128
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,339
but still, I'm guilty.

129
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:41,876
I'm such a villain.

130
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,180
I deserve to be despised by you.

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,075
But from now on,

132
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,270
if there's anything I can help with,

133
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,970
just tell me.

134
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,534
I'll be at your service

135
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,040
without complaining.

136
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,259
Mr. Yang, playing your strong points

137
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,239
and helping Mr. Meng
to topple the Rong Family

138
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,486
are enough to atone for this sin.

139
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,015
As for your other sins,

140
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,369
I'm in no position to put in a word.

141
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,239
Have a seat.

142
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,359
Mr. Meng told me

143
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,949
that you found the clue
about my parentage.

144
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,119
Yes.

145
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,240
Rong Dingkun

146
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:26,925
is actually not a Rong.

147
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,425
He's a Qin.

148
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,980
What did you say?

149
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,650
Zhao Hua'an has been
following Rong Dingkun

150
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,690
since he started his business.

151
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,024
He knows all the secrets of him.

152
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,121
I bought off
one of his trusted followers.

153
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,320
The man told me something.

154
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:45,004
Zhao Hua'an's daughter
got married the year before last.

155
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,200
At her wedding,

156
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,520
he was so drunk

157
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,039
that he said a lot of crappy things.

158
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,835
One of those was

159
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,500
Rong Dingkun was supposed to be

160
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,571
Qin Shuigen.

161
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,825
How did he become Rong Dingkun?

162
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,840
Did he change his name midway?

163
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,699
He seemed to have assumed

164
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,850
the identity of Rong Dingkun
from the beginning.

165
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,796
He is probably not my biological father.

166
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,685
Were Zhao Hua'an's words credible?

167
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,660
It's said, "In wine there is truth."

168
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,460
I think they were credible.

169
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,780
All immediate family of Rong Dingkun,

170
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,930
his parents,

171
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,409
grandparents and siblings,

172
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,050
died of a plague.

173
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,750
But the local elders told me

174
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,920
that the Rong Family lived
outside the town,

175
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,799
sheltering at home.

176
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,599
They were fine all the time,

177
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,525
then Rong Dingkun

178
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,885
went home with the bodies
of his wife and children

179
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,799
who died of the plague,

180
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,000
bringing them with the disease.

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
That whole family
was infected with it and died.

182
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,599
Only Rong Dingkun,

183
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,855
who had taken western medicine,

184
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,599
was safe and sound.

185
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,186
You mean,

186
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,531
to disguise himself,

187
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,280
he killed the whole family?

188
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,424
That's my guess.

189
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,446
Over the past 20 years,

190
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,219
Rong Dingkun has never

191
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,019
been in touch with the rest relatives
of the Rong Family.

192
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,100
He'd rather put the children of
the Huang Family in important positions

193
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,445
than promote the people
of the Rong Family.

194
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:16,865
Isn't that strange?

195
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,250
You're right.

196
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,609
He has a guilty conscience

197
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,779
and dare not meet
with the people of the Rong Family.

198
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:23,976
Right.

199
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,736
If he was to hide
behind a false identity,

200
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,859
why was it Rong Dingkun?

201
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,036
Where is

202
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:33,936
the real Rong Dingkun?

203
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,701
I'll dig deep.

204
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:42,766
Mr. Yang,

205
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:45,846
thanks for your information.

206
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:46,966
I'm glad

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,199
it's helpful.

208
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:53,795
I want to correct my mistakes.

209
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:56,575
I hope Rong Dingkun

210
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,659
gets the punishment he deserves.

211
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,906
May I ask

212
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,425
what Mr. Meng will give you in return?

213
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:10,464
If I help him to absorb the Rong Family,

214
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,559
he'll give me their transportation line
to Taiwan.

215
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,775
That's a generous reward.

216
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,350
Miss Feng,

217
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,101
what's your plan next?

218
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,075
If the war is to be declared,

219
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,260
I'm afraid you and Jiashang...

220
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,816
We're done.

221
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:40,065
He seems

222
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,430
to mistake me for his sister.

223
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,481
But it's better this way.

224
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,559
Let him think like that.

225
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,981
Whatever the truth is,

226
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,029
we have no future.

227
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,850
So he got it.

228
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,559
Still talking?

229
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,440
You're back.

230
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,675
Come on. Let me carry it.

231
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,000
- You must be tired.
- Gotta go.

232
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,119
- OK. See you.
- See you.

233
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,000
See you.

(Red House Hospital)

235
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,841
Have you had lunch?

236
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,530
Yes.

237
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Haven't you had yet?

238
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,640
Don't be too late, or there will be
no braised chicken legs.

239
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:54,465
Got it. I'm going now.

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,491
(Municipal Junior Primary School)

241
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,400
They're out.

242
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,640
- Here they are.
- Here they are.

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm here.

244
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,820
- Mom.
- I'm here.

245
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,575
- This way.
- Be careful.

246
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:07,400
- Mom.
- Come.

247
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,025
Mom.

248
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,640
Come on.

249
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,250
Let's go.

250
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:11,975
Come.

251
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,025
Shizhen,

252
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,075
don't wait.

253
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,329
Your brother probably

254
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,769
went home.

255
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:21,970
He wouldn't.

256
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,009
He promised me.

257
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:26,450
OK, then.

(Municipal Junior Primary School)

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,539
Shixun.

261
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:32,900
Come on, let's go home.

262
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,650
Yeah.

263
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,159
Sorry, I'm late.

264
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,520
I hear

265
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,679
you apply to the hospital

266
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,880
for taking a family member abroad.

267
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,719
The news has spread among the nurses.

268
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,719
It's my sister.

269
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,550
I'm going to take her with me.

270
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,880
Your sister?

271
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,559
Isn't she teaching at Peking?

272
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,919
The scholarship

273
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,039
is generous enough

274
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,200
for the two of us

275
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,679
to live abroad.

276
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,400
I have

277
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,080
chosen a good college for her.

278
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,159
She is very intelligent.

279
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,650
I'm sure she'll get a master's degree.

280
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,040
I've never seen a brother
who loves his sister so much.

281
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm afraid your future wife

282
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,520
wouldn't get along with your sister.

283
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,825
I have no plans to get married for now.

(Wenchunli)

285
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,525
Miss, do you want to buy a house?

286
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,560
The new houses
are built by the Rong Company.

287
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:06,925
They're all detached houses,

288
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,400
with four bedrooms,

289
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
two bathrooms

290
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,040
and the latest drainage.

291
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,160
Have all the old houses

292
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,275
been torn down?

293
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,719
Not yet.

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,081
There,

295
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,149
at the west corner,

296
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:19,350
there is an old house.

297
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,400
It isn't badly burned.

298
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,530
Somehow,

299
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,560
it hasn't been demolished.

300
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,880
Thanks.

301
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:25,075
You're welcome.

302
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,599
Almost 60%

303
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,680
of the houses here have been sold.

304
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,400
Go along the street, you'll find
the river at the third turning.

305
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,575
When the port is completed…

306
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,288
Very good.

307
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,400
…private boats can...

308
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,550
And...

309
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,834
Jiashang,

310
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,375
what's wrong?

311
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,300
Nothing.

312
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,721
Sorry, where were we?

313
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,975
The port.

314
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:15,925
It will be a civilian port

315
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,800
with 80 to 100 berths.

316
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,375
The supporting shops

317
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,495
and hotel apartments

318
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,175
are all under construction.

319
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,119
Jiashang,

320
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,721
do you like sailing?

321
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,439
My uncle gave me a new yacht.

322
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,520
It was launched last month.

323
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,280
I'd have a cocktail party on it

324
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,640
with my schoolmates and friends.

325
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,325
Will you come?

326
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,239
Thanks for your kind invitation.

327
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,751
But,

328
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,950
I'm a little afraid of water.

329
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:47,476
I seldom go to the sea.

330
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:49,079
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

331
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,620
Hello?

332
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,630
Mr. Rong. Hello.

333
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,131
This is Peking Hotel.

334
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,225
About the hairy crabs
we've been keeping for you,

335
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,940
since Miss Feng never came again,

336
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:07,000
do you still want to keep them?

337
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:08,805
Keep them.

338
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:09,880
Yes.

339
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,400
Hello? Who's calling?

340
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,439
Hello.

341
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,119
May I talk to Miss Feng
on the third floor?

342
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:29,640
Miss Feng?

343
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,880
She isn't here.

344
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,189
Where is she?

345
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:34,079
I have no idea.

346
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,239
She left in a hurry

347
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,000
and didn't say goodbye to us.

348
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,379
When did she leave?

349
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,000
About two days ago.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,360
She left early in the morning
with a suitcase.

351
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,480
OK, I see.

352
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:46,456
Thanks.

353
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,690

Trace the whereabouts
of Feng Shizhen right away.

356

Yes.

357
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,200
Young master,

358
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
is something wrong

359
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,199
with Miss Feng?

360
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,174
I suspect
that she has returned to Shanghai.

361
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,971
How could she be in Shanghai?

362
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,319
Isn't Miss Feng

363
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:21,900
teaching in Peking?

364
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:24,475
Send your men

365
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:25,850
to look for her all over Shanghai,

366
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:27,640
especially at Meng Xu'an's place.

367
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,501
Once you find her,

368
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,501
tell me immediately.

369
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,240
Yes.

370
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:57,800
What's wrong?

371
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,579
What happened out there?

372
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,946
You seem to be in a bad mood.

373
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,115
Is it because of your aunt?

374
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,074
I tell you what,

375
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,261
you can ask her at dinner.

376
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,305
Let's see what she'll say.

377
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,611
OK.

378
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,105
Be my guest.

379
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:24,959
Help yourself.

380
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,160
OK.

381
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,439
I just

382
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,350
had the kitchen cook several dishes.

383
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,265
I wonder if they're to your taste.

384
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,025
How would they not be?

385
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:34,599
Shanghai cuisines
are known to be delicate.

386
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,766
I'm lucky to enjoy them.

387
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,019
Here.

388
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:40,580
Thanks.

389
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Aunt,

390
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,800
my father...

391
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
I know you want to know

392
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,560
what happened to your parents.

393
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,635
I've searched my memory.

394
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,675
I'll tell you everything I remember.

395
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,211
The Rong Family

396
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:08,090
was rich in their early years.

397
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,999
Later, the harvest

398
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:11,520
got worse year by year.

399
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,400
Actually, before you were born,

400
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,159
their life had already become hard.

401
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,509
Most of the farmhands were fired.

402
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:20,354
Your father was far-sighted.

403
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,975
He didn't want to rely on
the several acres of land.

404
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,149
He wanted to go out.

405
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,725
He took

406
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:29,885
about 50 silver dollars

407
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:31,306
and went to Shanghai

408
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:32,925
with some fellow-townsmen
to do business.

409
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,515
Why didn't my mother come with him?

410
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,050
She conceived you
soon after they were married.

411
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,690
So she stayed in Guojia Town.

412
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:41,596
What did my father do for a living

413
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,470
after he came to Shanghai?

414
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,840
He did...

415
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,516
I don't know it well.

416
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,959
He seemed to buy some

417
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,920
inferior imported goods on a dock

418
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,336
and go round the streets to sell them.

419
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,319
Later, he rented a shop
with one of his friends.

420
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,175
Their business was much better.

421
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,275
But it didn't last long.

422
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,839
His friend owed money,

423
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,959
so he pledged the shop

424
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,319
in order to pay debts for his friend.

425
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,430
Did my father

426
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,379
often help his friends?

427
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:14,485
He was very helpful.

428
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,021
He had many friends.

429
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,661
When he arrived in Shanghai,

430
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,479
he rented a house

431
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:22,558
with several friends at Shikumen.

432
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,599
One of his friends had a big family.

433
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,050
So he gave up the big sunlit room

434
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,225
to his friend.

435
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,719
He lived in the garret instead.

436
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,599
Because of that,

437
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,199
my sister often complained

438
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,840
that he was too honest

439
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,561
and he might get the worst of it.

440
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,800
Though your parents often lived
in two places,

441
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:41,754
they loved each other very much.

442
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:44,599
Fangzhen,

443
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,910
I hear

444
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:48,396
your father is now

445
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:50,695
the richest man in Shanghai.

446
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,160
Why don't you go to see him?

447
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,160
If he knew you were alive,

448
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,479
he would be so happy.

449
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes.

450
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,479
Ms. Qian.

451
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,280
You said Rong Dingkun

452
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:06,800
made a lot of money

453
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,250
and became rich.

454
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,439
How did he make the money?

455
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,680
He hit the jackpot.

456
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:15,315
My sister wrote to me about it.

457
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,119
Did his friends at Shikumen

458
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,239
know about it?

459
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,225
I'm not sure about it.

460
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:24,694
But they lived in the same house.

461
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,000
Those who were

462
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,439
close with him must know.

463
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,525
Of all his friends,

464
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,531
did anyone look like him?

465
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:34,284
Yes,

466
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,810
there was one, actually.

467
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,959
When he arrived in Shanghai,

468
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,000
he saved a man
who was about to kill himself.

469
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,839
He paid the man's debt for him.

470
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,040
My sister blamed him
for spending money recklessly.

471
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
He said

472
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,160
the man looked very like him.

473
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:48,800
He thought they had a bond.

474
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,239
Later, they even

475
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:51,675
became sworn brothers.

476
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,600
Aunt,

477
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:55,545
do you remember that man's name?

478
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:57,425
Was it

479
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,550
Qin Shuigen?

480
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,460
Name?

481
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,316
I don't remember.

482
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:06,439
I think he was a bricklayer.

483
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,175
Because your parents

484
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,880
quarreled over him.

485
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Your father said

486
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,000
the man got a job fixing roofs.

487
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
He would pay back the money.

488
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,525
My husband was fixing roofs, too.

489
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:19,075
So I remember it clearly.

490
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,439
He.

491
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,350
I...

492
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,920
Didn't I bury you?

493
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,400
Why do you come again?

494
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,850
Don't keep pestering me.

495
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,835
Go away.

496
00:26:58,475 --> 00:26:59,475
Mr. Meng.

497
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:02,400
It occurs to me!

498
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:03,925
It occurs to me

499
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:05,085
when I heard the name He.

500
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,450
Calm down.

501
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,450
Take your time.

502
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,770
I once approached Rong Dingkun
after he smoked opium

503
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,375
in order to steal his seal.

504
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:17,884
He was clouded in mind

505
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:19,675
and mistook me for He.

506
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:21,154
He kept yelling at me,

507
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,835
begging me not to take revenge on him.

508
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,595
He almost had a meltdown.

509
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,449
Look at the evidence Mr. Yang found.

510
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,300
This is Rong Dingkun's
medical examinations.

511
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,640
(Medical Examinations of Rong Dingkun)
It records in detail

512
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,000
(Medical Examinations of Rong Dingkun)
Rong Dingkun's condition.

513
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:36,696
His legs were never broken.

514
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:38,604
There are no signs of healing
of the bones.

515
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,100
(Medical Examinations of Rong Dingkun)

516
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,475
(The upper and lower limb bones
are intact without traces of healing.)

517
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,991
That's the truth.

518
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,940
Aunt said my father

519
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,880
was honest,

520
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,225
kind,

521
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,970
loyal to his friends,

522
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:01,295
and loved my mother very much.

523
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:03,615
But Rong Dingkun

524
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,416
is suspicious,

525
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,870
has lots of women,

526
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:10,079
and traffics arms and opium.

527
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,920
He is a devil.

528
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,435
That's enough to prove

529
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
they're two different men.

530
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,375
Though they were unrelated,

531
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,675
they looked so alike

532
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,751
that one could

533
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:22,565
take the place of the other

534
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:24,925
and win his relatives' trust.

535
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,760
He could intimate
the accent and behavior,

536
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
but

537
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:32,346
they were still two different men.

538
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:36,174
So all of the Rong Family
suddenly fell ill and died.

539
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,275
My mother died miserably.

540
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,515
People who were close
to the real Rong Dingkun

541
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,781
and could tell the true from the false

542
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:49,319
all died.

543
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,100
It's easy to explain.

544
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,456
You would think

545
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:54,496
the one who killed your mother
was your father.

546
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:58,044
I remember it was dark

547
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,300
in cold winter.

548
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,625
If a man who looked like my father

549
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,620
changed his appearance a bit with,

550
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:09,696
for example, a beard or a hat,

551
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,359
my mother was likely to mistake him.

552
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,991
If it were me,

553
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,119
I would kill your mother

554
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,079
before she knew.

555
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,520
An injured girl falling into a river

556
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,175
was the most hopeless.

557
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:26,554
And the little baby

558
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,625
was even easier to get rid of.

559
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,400
I began to remember things at that time.

560
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,925
He had to kill me.

561
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,275
But my brother

562
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,450
was just a baby.

563
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:47,425
He might...

564
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,884
He might be still alive.

565
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:54,845
Even though Rong Dingkun
is extremely violent and wicked,

566
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,629
he wouldn't have killed a baby.

567
00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:00,160
Miss Feng, don't worry.

568
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Tomorrow morning, I'll look into

569
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,691
if Rong Dingkun had given away a baby

570
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,400
or placed him with foster parents
around that time.

571
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,245
Mr. Yang,

572
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,526
I don't

573
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:14,005
quite agree with you.

574
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:16,920
Rong Dingkun…

575
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,825
Qin Shuigen.

576
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:25,439
Qin Shuigen didn't hesitate

577
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,079
to kill the entire Rong Family.

578
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,765
How would he care about a baby?

579
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,581
I'm going to see Qin Shuigen.

580
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:37,475
I'm going to ask him

581
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,225
where he hid my father's body.

582
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,331
Over the past 20 years,

583
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,534
my father has been accused

584
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,460
of killing his wife and children.

585
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,350
If he knew about it in heaven,

586
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,559
how painful would he feel?

587
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:53,775
(Medical Examinations of Rong Dingkun)

588
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:55,435
I must find him

589
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,675
and clear his name.

590
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,600
Though Qin Shuigen

591
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,050
is disabled now,

592
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,445
he isn't an ordinary person

593
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:10,804
after all.

594
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,231
If we confront him hastily,

595
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:14,830
we may be led by the nose.

596
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,991
We'll be thrown into passivity.

597
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,950
So,

598
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:18,466
the priority

599
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:20,256
is to find your father's body.

600
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:21,856
Then we'll make him confess.

601
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,780
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

602
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,465
It's been over 20 years.

603
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,100
Who knows where he hid the body?

604
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,079
Anyway,

605
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,159
I'll ask my men to look into it.

606
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,319
Help!

607
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,680
Help!

608
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:00,015
Help!

609
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,599
Master,

610
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,359
what's up?

611
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,040
There...

612
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,199
There is a man.

613
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,424
Master,

614
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,361
they are just clothes
and the clothes stand.

615
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,525
No one is here.

616
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,739
Master.

617
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:14,500
This is...?

618
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,680
(Tian Qian runs 40%)
You think I have no idea

619
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,450
(or more of his business in Shanghai...)
about what the old guys in the company

620
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:22,650
have concealed from me?

621
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,050
People

622
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,450
are always insatiable.

623
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,190
Give them an inch,

624
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,969
and they'll reach out for a yard.

625
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:38,505
After some time,

626
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,654
we'll always catch them tripping.

627
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,351
Make good use of it.

628
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:52,150
Retake Rong Company's ownership
as soon as possible.

629
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,691
But...

630
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,920
Jiashang...

631
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Ignore him.

632
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,490
He's a family traitor.

633
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:10,100
You and I made the Rong empire.

634
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,850
I won't watch him ruin it.

635
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,900
Hua'an.

636
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,375
Yes?

637
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,900
You're my most trusted man.

638
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,016
Don't betray me.

639
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,509
Dingkun,

640
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,300
I've been following you for years.

641
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,639
I've long regarded you

642
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,360
as my own elder brother.

643
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,479
Of all people,

644
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,439
I'm the least likely to betray you.

645
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:51,386
Good.

646
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,850
Young master.

647
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,479
Miss Feng

648
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,950
has left Peking

649
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,250
and returned to Shanghai.

650
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:12,639
Where is she now?

651
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,350
She's

652
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:16,934
at the Meng's Residence.

653
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:29,919
Mr. Meng.

654
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,100
Rong Jiashang came.

655
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,300
He asked to see Miss Feng.

656
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:41,959
Where's Miss Feng?

657
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,600
She's in the study with Mr. Yang.

658
00:35:49,575 --> 00:35:50,775
Don't disturb her.

659
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,164
You can leave now.

660
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:54,061
Yes.

661
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:20,705
Where is Shizhen?

662
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:24,185
Why are you so sure she is here?

663
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:25,594
We both know it.

664
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,011
Stop playing games.

665
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:29,555
Since you know everything,

666
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:30,754
why don't you ask yourself

667
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:32,125
what right do you have to see her?

668
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,879
If you have the time,

669
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,350
you'd better go ask your father

670
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,110
what he had done.

671
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:38,500
What do you mean?

672
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:39,835
The photo…

673
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:41,200
Shizhen has seen it.

674
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,700
Meng Xu'an!

675
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,325
Get off him!

676
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,195
Don't get too worked up.

677
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,900
There are some things

678
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,751
that you just can't pretend

679
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,540
they've never happened.

680
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,400
Walk him out.

681
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:10,194
Meng Xu'an!

682
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:39,065
How is it going?

683
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,320
Mr. Meng,

684
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,375
we've overlooked

685
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,879
very important information.

686
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,566
When Qin Shuigen mistook me for He,

687
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:47,895
he said

688
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:49,650
he buried He with his own hands.

689
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,399
In that case,

690
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:53,626
my father's body must be somewhere.

691
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,679
But Shanghai is such a big city.

692
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,265
Your father's body

693
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:00,600
could be buried anywhere.

694
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,040
No.

695
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,680
The body was too important.

696
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,600
Qin Shuigen wouldn't
dispose of it carelessly.

697
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,551
He is very paranoid.

698
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,831
He killed my father

699
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,390
and took his identity.

700
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,751
Over the past 20 years,

701
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:13,675
he's been scared.

702
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:15,634
He's scared of my father.

703
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,170
He's scared of my father's ghost

704
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,560
coming back to demand his life.

705
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:23,644
Qin Shuigen did a lot of bad things.

706
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:25,676
He would make sure again and again

707
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:26,800
that his secret

708
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,225
couldn't be found out.

709
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:29,734
He probably buried the body

710
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:31,125
in a place

711
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,679
that under his own control,

712
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,280
nobody can find

713
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,050
and he can check on it

714
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,639
at any time.

715
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,900
Only in this way would he feel at ease.

716
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,825
The Rong Family
has many enemies in Shanghai.

717
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,440
Everyone wants to dig up their scandals.

718
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,599
Such a big secret

719
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,850
can never fall into the hands of others.

720
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,800
Therefore,

721
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,350
he must have buried your father's body

722
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,850
in his own territory.

723
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,479
20 years ago,

724
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,225
Qin Shuigen took
My father's lottery ticket.

725
00:38:58,225 --> 00:39:00,030
At that time, he had no foundation

726
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,230
and no business

727
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,494
in Shanghai.

728
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,700
I remember, in his files,

729
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,680
the first properties he bought

730
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,840
were two warehouses.

731
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
(Wenchunli)
They should be near the water-gate.

732
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,199
Later, he married Mrs. Tang,

733
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,040
bought a house and a shop

734
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,320
and started a company.

735
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,275
Two years later,

736
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,074
he bought a piece of land,
on which he built

737
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:22,500
the Rong's Residence.

738
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,009
He shouldn't have buried the body

739
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:27,575
in his own residence.

740
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,439
Where would it be?

741
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:35,656
The warehouses are in use all the time.

742
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,075
It's inconvenient to hide a body there.

743
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,080
Guojia Town is too far away.

744
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,315
Besides, in a small town in the country,

745
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,150
any rustle of leaves in the wind

746
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,330
would attract attention.

747
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,365
What if we reason it reversely

748
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,250
and start with the clues
concerning my father?

749
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:52,806
Didn't my aunt say

750
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,124
when my father was in Shanghai,

751
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,054
he bought goods on a dock?

752
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,156
He should have lived nearby the dock.

753
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,080
I remember it.

754
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,611
Behind Wenchunli

755
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,159
was a small dock.

756
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:06,360
When I was a child,

757
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,360
I used to watch freighters
unloading there.

758
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:09,845
If

759
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,900
this friend my father mentioned
in his letter

760
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,320
who borrowed money from him
was Qin Shuigen,

761
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:17,436
they should have lived together.

762
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,991
So they must be near the dock.

763
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,080
There are many docks in Shanghai.

764
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Why are you sure it's the dock
behind Wenchunli?

765
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,475
Because Qin Shuigen

766
00:40:30,425 --> 00:40:32,146
set fire to that one.

767
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,750
It occurs to me

768
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:39,335
that the Rong Family
owns a property in Wenchunli.

769
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,169
They didn't buy it after the fire.

770
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:42,675
They've owned it since before.

771
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,370
Is it an old house

772
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:53,795
located near
a sweet-scented osmanthus tree

773
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:56,246
at a distance of 20 or 30 paces?

774
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,390
A house of an arched iron gate

775
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,040
with two stories

776
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,475
and iron fences
both upstairs and downstairs.

777
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,750
I only went there once after the fire.

778
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,650
I don't recall it clearly.

779
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,070
But it really is a two-story house.

780
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:13,975
The other houses around it

781
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,336
have all been torn down.

782
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:17,100
Qin Shuigen wouldn't
have this one demolished.

783
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,675
He only let the workers
repaint its wall.

784
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,360
He wouldn't let the workers in.

785
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,120
Yes.

786
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:24,905
I thought it was weird,

787
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:26,575
so I asked Zhao Hua'an.

788
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,275
He told me

789
00:41:28,575 --> 00:41:30,825
it was the place where Rong Dingkun
lived before he made a fortune

790
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,159
in his early years.

791
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,080
He had emotional ties for it,

792
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:34,639
so he bought it

793
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,760
to mourn for the past.

794
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,760
He kept everything the same
in the house.

795
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,761
He also fitted a new big iron gate on.

796
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,120
Right.

797
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,650
It was the place.

798
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,586
They were together at that time.

799
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:54,615
They did business together.

800
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:56,315
They rented the house together.

801
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,340
Later on,

802
00:41:59,675 --> 00:42:01,155
Qin Shuigen

803
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:04,116
killed my father

804
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,625
for a lottery ticket.

805
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,640
I suddenly remember a clue.

806
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,439
I thought it had nothing to do with it.

807
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,360
Now thinking about it, it's relevant.

808
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,805
The Zhang Family,
the real estate mogul in Shanghai,

809
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,159
once offered to buy Wenchunli.

810
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,600
But the negotiation had just begun

811
00:42:22,825 --> 00:42:24,466
before Qin Shuigen stepped in.

812
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,259
He was afraid
people would know about the house,

813
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,671
so he rushed into absorbing Wenchunli

814
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,470
by setting fire to it.

815
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:39,206
But that's the only house
he dare not touch

816
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,725
because my father

817
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,296
is buried in there.
