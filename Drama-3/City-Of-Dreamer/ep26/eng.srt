3
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,925
1,500.

4
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,750
1,800.

5
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,150
I hear 1,800 from No.7.

6
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,270
1,800.

7
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,225
1,800?

8
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,879
He can buy a small apartment
with a little more money.

9
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,775
Yeah.

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,440
Whose son is this?

11
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,319
He's careless about money.

12
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,000
Aren't his family afraid
he'll dissipate their fortune?

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,319
1,800.

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,150
Is anyone bidding more than 1,800?

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,250
2,000.

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,600
No.16 bid 2,000.

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,481
2,000.

18
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:10,759
It's 2,000 already!

19
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,600
Is anyone bidding

20
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,679
more than 2,000?

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,600
2,000 going once.

22
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,421
2,000.

23
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,759
Going twice.

24
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,871
2,000.

25
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,531
Going thrice.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,161
Sold.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,050
- Good!
- Good!

28
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,045
Congratulations to this gentleman
for getting the jewelry.

29
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,639
The bidding
seems to be aggressive.

30
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:39,919
Yeah.

Good.

It suits you well.

Mrs. Qian. This way.

44
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,600
Those desserts are delicious.

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
Really? Let's go upstairs and have some.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Come on, let's get to the front.

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,300
Let's come here next time.

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,092
OK. This way, please.

49
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,300
Here, please.

50
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,146
Let's sit over there.

51
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,919
You look beautiful today.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,440
But the gems are not fine enough.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,800
I still think the south red agate
fits you better.

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,279
It's a pity you don't like my agate.

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,025
Which woman doesn't like
nice jewelries?

56
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,759
What I mind is your motives
for giving me gifts.

57
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,759
Like just now,

58
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,349
what did you want me to say?

59
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,911
What did I do?

60
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,240
The necklace only costs
several hundred yuan

61
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,559
and you bid 2,000.

62
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:13,225
Are you the decoy

63
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:14,066
of the Auction House?

64
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,559
If you hate Meng Xu'an,

65
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,519
you should be grateful
that I made him pay more.

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,559
If you like him,

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,720
you should be more grateful

68
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,640
that I tested him for you.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,040
In short,

70
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,320
you think I owe you a favor?

71
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,850
I like it when you owe me a favor.

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
At least we have some bonds,

73
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,559
don't we?

74
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,484
It was highly competitive just now.

75
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,286
Why aren't you with Miss Du?

76
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,050
Let's come back later.

77
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,550
OK. Come here, please.

78
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,119
She is expecting

79
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,320
and in a bad mood.

80
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,640
I don't want to annoy her.

81
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,075
Expecting?

82
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,250
Do you mean...

83
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:55,925
It's not mine.

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,839
What about you?

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,959
Meng Xu'an's junior?

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,279
Or what?

87
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,640
Baoli thought I was bored all day long

88
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,475
and suggested
bringing me to the auction.

89
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:12,320
Mr. Meng happened to be there.

90
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:13,725
He was willing to be my date.

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,300
Why should I say no?

92
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,275
Meng Xu'an is really a gentleman.

93
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,920
Of all the social gatherings in Shanghai
at the end of the year,

94
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,225
why did he bring you to this auction?

95
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,500
What's special about this auction?

96
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,050
By the way,

97
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,790
what's going on with Fanglin?

98
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,925
Your family

99
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,500
don't want to

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
pair her off with that sickly man,
do they?

101
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,325
It's just a perfunctory effort
out of courtesy.

102
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,100
I hear Hashimoto Taichi

103
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,550
has heart disease.

104
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,519
Why doesn't he rest at home?

105
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,275
Isn't he afraid of
having any accidents

106
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,040
at the auction?

107
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,440
A sick man also needs
some time out of doors.

108
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,500
Besides,

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,075
it's just an auction.

110
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,475
What accidents can you expect?

111
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,144
Meng Xu'an is quite charming.

112
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:09,215
Is he the reason

113
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:11,406
why you've been turning me down?

114
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,799
Why do you always bring him into this?

115
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,800
Why do you always tangle with him?

116
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,325
I have social activities, too.

117
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,890
You interfere too much.

118
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,534
Besides, you're no better than me.

119
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,480
You have Du Lanxin

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
and Hashimoto Shiori
at the same time.

121
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,839
Why don't you
take care of the two women first

122
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,959
before you mind my business?

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
My engagement to Du Lanxin

124
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,525
will be broken off soon.

125
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,421
What about Hashimoto Shiori?

126
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,375
I won't get engaged to her.

127
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,351
It's a dead end, Jiashang.

128
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,920
Without Du Lanxin
and Hashimoto Shiori,

129
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,500
there will be other women,

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,100
other rich families that want to
connect with your family by marriage.

131
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,799
It's not the problem of women.

132
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,160
The problem is

133
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,880
you can't decide your own marriage.

134
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,679
In this case,

135
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
you still want me to promise you.

136
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,399
Don't you think it's selfish?

137
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
Give me some more time.

138
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,000
Six months.

139
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,480
Would you wait for me
for another six months?

140
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,079
Six months later,

141
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,519
if I'm still so disappointing,

142
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,720
you can marry Meng Xu'an.

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,399
Why would I marry him?

144
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:16,455
Besides,

145
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,125
I can't wait for six months.

146
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,841
Let's get this straight.

147
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:28,555
How much time will you give me

148
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,750
so that I can fight for us?

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,921
Tonight.

150
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,445
Just tonight.

151
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,559
What did you say?

152
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,225
Are you serious?

153
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,225
I'm serious.

154
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,920
Right now.

155
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,400
Will you go with me?

156
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:50,839
Where are we going?

157
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,236
We can go anywhere.

158
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:53,959
Let's get two train tickets

159
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,160
and leave here.

160
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,880
Leave your family and my family.

161
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,125
Let's leave Shanghai.

162
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,519
Are you testing me

163
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,500
or is it a hypothesis?

164
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,951
Jiashang,

165
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,600
you're not the same with them.

166
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,239
You have ideals and ambition.

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,959
You want a different life

168
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,399
and you have the qualifications
and abilities to pursue it.

169
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,501
God has been good to you.

170
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,169
You shouldn't give up.

171
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,975
Jiashang.

172
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:25,224
Let's go. Leave here.

173
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,825
Say yes. Just say it.

174
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Sorry, Shizhen.

175
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,445
I'm the eldest son of my family.

176
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,835
Though I don't want to
take over the family business,

177
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,011
I can't walk away like this.

178
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,976
Admit it or not,

179
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,719
the Rong family is a giant ship
that is destined to sink.

180
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,575
Your father is doomed to failure.

181
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,000
If you stay with him,

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
you'll be drawn into trouble
step by step.

183
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,719
I know.

184
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,900
Who wouldn't want to

185
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,425
do whatever he likes freely?

186
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,975
But there are

187
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,375
innocent members in my family.

188
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,960
I must protect them.

189
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:09,796
I have to take the responsibility,

190
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,760
even if the giant ship

191
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,220
is destined to sink.

192
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,365
What about us?

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
You asked me to wait for you.

194
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,719
Do you want me to rescue you

195
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,025
after the ship sinks?

196
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:25,679
Or do you think in six months,

197
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,000
your family will collapse?

198
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,475
Don't you yearn for
the blue sky and white clouds?

199
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,650
You should fly

200
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,039
to the blue sky

201
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,080
and pursue whatever you want to.

202
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,989
I hate your father.

203
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,400
But I really hope...

204
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,200
I really hope one day,

205
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,725
I don't have to hate you.

206
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:51,000
Shizhen,

207
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,550
what happened

208
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,175
that makes you
want to run away with me?

209
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,600
You're always rational and restrained.

210
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
It was a spur of the moment.

211
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,760
Just think of me as drunk.

212
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,300
No.

213
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,375
What else do you want?

214
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,975
Do you want me to say
I'm so crazy about you

215
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,584
that I can't wait for you
to deal with your family mess

216
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:14,075
to run away with you?

217
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:21,960
Shizhen.

218
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,725
Jiashang.

219
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,675
Leave with me tonight.

220
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,625
I'll do anything.

221
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,086
I remember it.

222
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,125
I remember everything you said today.

223
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,015
The day will come
when I leave with you.

224
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,250
The invitation is available

225
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,175
just for tonight.

226
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,361
Shizhen.

227
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,950
I know what you feel now.

228
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm very touched.

229
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,936
But there are things I have to do.

230
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,359
Maybe in your opinion,

231
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,719
I should give up my family

232
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,039
for my future.

233
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:27,265
But in my view,

234
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,840
I want both.

235
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,440
I want to protect my family

236
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,599
and fulfill my ambitions.

237
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,875
And you,

238
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,625
I want you, too.

239
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,891
He still doesn't

240
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,721
want to leave with you, does he?

241
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:32,905
Did you

242
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:35,565
expect this?

243
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,039
Believe me.

244
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,760
It's his loss

245
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,840
that he doesn't leave with you.

246
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,751
Not necessarily.

247
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,100
First,

248
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,500
elopement never ends well.

249
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:51,446
Second,

250
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,320
though I don't know

251
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,025
what plan
do the Rong family have tonight,

252
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,159
but Rong Jiashang

253
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
is always careful.

254
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,999
He may allow for
unforeseen circumstances.

255
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,525
But you seem to

256
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,335
have a well-thought-out plan

257
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,025
and want me to see a big play.

258
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,996
I dare not say

259
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,469
there will be a big play.

260
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:18,545
You know me.

261
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,425
I don't guarantee anything.

262
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:26,136
But women

263
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,881
are all the same.

264
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,049
You would be crazy about love.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800
I knew a woman

266
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:38,250
who once smiled like
she smelt flowers in the air.

267
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,919
But in the end,

268
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,559
she was devastated by love.

269
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,400
In your words,

270
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,280
love always seems to be
a dreadful monster.

271
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,875
Have you never seen true happy love?

272
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,880
It would be better if it's really

273
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,760
a dreadful monster.

274
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,175
Everyone would avoid it, then.

275
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:01,935
However,

276
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,145
what is love really like?

277
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,435
It's like opium.

278
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,800
Smoking it once,

279
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
and you'll feel carefree and joyous

280
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,559
like treading on air.

281
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,840
But as soon as it's cut off,

282
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,400
you'll be miserable like hell.

283
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,231
Such being the case,

284
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,450
people shouldn't smoke it
in the first place.

285
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:24,800
What should they do?

286
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
They couldn't stop themselves

287
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,025
from falling in love.

288
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,239
Those who can't curb their impulses

289
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,919
are usually weak.

290
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,440
But what should they do

291
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,799
if they're already addicted to it?

292
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,559
Mrs. Rong, you're really lucky.

293
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,679
You have a handsome
and talented son

294
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,811
- as well as a beautiful daughter.
- Have some water.

295
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:09,840
OK, thanks.

296
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,039
Thanks.

297
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,400
We're flattered.

298
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,250
My big brother seems to
like Fanglin very much.

299
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,159
Taichi doesn't look well.

300
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,159
Does he need to go home
and have a rest?

301
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:33,756
Our children have a lot to talk about.

302
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,719
Let's not

303
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:37,520
bother them.

304
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:38,975
Sure.

305
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,000
That's right.

306
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,239
Mrs. Rong, don't worry.

307
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,239
Taichi is in good health.

308
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,725
Well, that's good.

309
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:50,935
Miss Rong,

310
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,479
I'd like to have a drink.

311
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,920
Would you drink with me?

312
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,600
Sorry.

313
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,559
It's embarrassing

314
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,275
for our first meeting.

315
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,030
It makes you uncomfortable.

316
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,359
Are you unhappy because

317
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,725
I look like in bad health?

318
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,650
No.

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,599
Because my father pairs me off with you
without asking my opinion.

320
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,119
His intention is too obvious.

321
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,875
That's what I hate.

322
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,200
You seem to be an independent woman.

323
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,050
I don't think you would like
an arranged marriage.

324
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,375
Me too.

325
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:48,559
In Japan, there is a saying that

326
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,760
an instant, one second,

327
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,350
which means time is short.

328
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,300
Since we are both under pressure,

329
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
we'd better get along as friends

330
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,159
and cherish the present.

331
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,791
How about that?

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,079
Are you all right?

333
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm fine.

334
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:15,905
I'm used to it.

335
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,400
It's my first time, too.

336
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:26,774
Yeah.

337
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,280
Miss Feng.

338
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,119
I remember clearly.

339
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:30,959
Miss Xiao said she felt sick

340
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,400
and asked you to accompany her.

341
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,199
What happened to her?

342
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,018
She seems to be drunk.

343
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,079
Please come with me.

344
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's go.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,625
Please.

346
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,640
Mr. Meng.

347
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,920
How is Baoli?

348
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:47,416
Let her in.

349
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:55,800
Miss Feng.

350
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,825
Hello, there.

351
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,925
Meng Xu'an, open the door.

352
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,100
Keep Xiaojiu good company.

353
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,800
Have a guess when you get time.

354
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,425
Who will be the winner

355
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,755
of tonight?

356
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,475
Meng Xu'an, what are you doing?

357
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,520
Are you insane?

358
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,925
Let me out.

359
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,450
Let me out!

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,199
Let me out!

361
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,294
Let me...

362
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,675
Xiaojiu,

363
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,839
why did your big brother bring you here?

364
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,880
He wants me to watch a play.

365
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,520
Miss Feng,
are you here to watch the play?

366
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,569
Watch the play?

367
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:14,520
What does that mean?

368
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,239
My brother said my daddy
is down there.

369
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,850
Do you know who he is?

370
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,916
My brother will
take me to see him later.

371
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:24,959
Do you think he will

372
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,160
like my suit?

373
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,475
How many people have your brother
brought here to watch the play?

374
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,475
They all work for my brother.

375
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:35,599
My brother said

376
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,456
he would make Daddy acknowledge me.

377
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,850
At that time,

378
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,050
he'll put that man...

379
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,775
He'll kill that man.

380
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,199
He'll kill that man.

381
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Kill who?

382
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,094
Your daddy?

383
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,119
How could he kill my daddy?

384
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,880
He'll kill the man
who took my birthright.

385
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,375
Took your birthright?

386
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,599
Who was it?

387
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,319
Daddy's eldest son, of course.

388
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,599
My brother said,

389
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,280
Daddy owes me and Mommy.

390
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,100
He owes me all the property

391
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,640
of the Rong family.

392
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,300
He also said,

393
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,119
Daddy misses me and Mommy very much.

394
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,625
He'll be happy

395
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,145
to see me.

396
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,175
Meng Xu'an doesn't care about
the Gold Kylin at all.

397
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:29,319
He doesn't care

398
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,359
if Rong Dingkun apologizes to him.

399
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,250
He wants Rong Jiashang's life,

400
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,509
then present Rong Dingkun
with a crippled and crazy son.

401
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,675
He wants him to know

402
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:41,119
what a terrible sin

403
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,079
he had committed 16 years ago.

404
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:46,575
Crazy!

405
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:47,760
Crazy!

406
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,250
Meng Xu'an has gone crazy.

407
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,225
He has no principles.

408
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
He won't hesitate
to kill someone innocent.

409
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,334
But what had

410
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,450
Rong Jiashang done wrong about it?

411
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,800
Your brother left you here.

412
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,500
What if you get sick?

413
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,479
The bodyguard has the pills.

414
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,023
And I'll behave,

415
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,599
or Daddy may not acknowledge me.

416
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,400
But your brother just locked the door.

417
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,560
How do you get the pills?

418
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,959
I have another key.

419
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Where is it?

420
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,700
Miss Feng,

421
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,560
have a guess.

422
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,160
Rest assured. I've notified the bank.

423
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,160
Great.

424
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,680
Do give us a chance to bid.

425
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,425
No problem.

426
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:49,425
I agree with you.

427
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,750
Come on. You'll be satisfied.

428
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,920
Ladies and gentlemen.

429
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:59,725
(Central China Antique Charity Auction)
The next item up for bid

430
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:01,439
is the most closely watched

431
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,680
and the most expensive treasure

432
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,199
in the auction,

433
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,750
Gold Kylin.

434
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,439
Gold Kylin?

435
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,875
I guess it may cost
thousands of silver dollars.

436
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,280
Let's wait and see.

437
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,479
It looks nice.

438
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,981
Let me see.

439
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,200
This is the first time I see it.

440
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,063
It's the Gold Kylin.

441
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,325
Mr. Hashimoto.

442
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,640
Mr. Hashimoto.

443
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Did you donate it anonymously?

444
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:36,700
No.

445
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,560
Are there two gold kylins?

446
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Are you all right?

447
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,786
Don't you feel well?

448
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,175
I didn't hear of it.

449
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,319
I've been looking for the Gold Kylin
for years.

450
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,479
I didn't hear it was a pair.

451
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,319
They shouldn't be a pair.

452
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,200
Take a closer look at the Gold Kylin.

453
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,820
It looks exactly the same

454
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,049
with the one the Hashimotos have.

455
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,680
It faces to the right.

456
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,655
If they're a pair,

457
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,075
it should face to the left.

458
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,050
Bid it at any cost.

459
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,850
Yes, Master.

460
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,650
- Not possible.
- Not possible.

461
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Not possible.

462
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,890
If it's authentic,

463
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,375
the one the Hashimotos own...

464
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,640
Thanks.

465
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,175
You didn't take a close look.

466
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,400
You can't be sure.

467
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,725
Jiashang.

468
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,280
Make sure you win it.

469
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,525
It can't fall into other hands.

470
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,225
- Jiashang.
- Yes.

471
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,500
- Let me see.
- Did you hear it?

472
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,525
Impossible, absolutely impossible.

473
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,680
Uncle, don't worry.

474
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,319
If your Gold Kylin

475
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,680
is in your house safe and sound,

476
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,359
this one must be fake.

477
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,075
Since I put an advertisement
in the papers,

478
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,479
I've seen many fakes.

00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,800

Take your men home quickly.

00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,700
Check if the Gold Kylin is still there.

483

Yes, Father.

- Taichi.
- What's going on?

- Taichi, how do you feel?
- Taichi.

- Take it easy.
- Don't worry.

496

He has the pills.

497
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,188
He must be sent to the hospital.

498
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:51,750
Yeah.

You'll feel better soon. Relax.

502
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,079
Take it easy.

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Tell me.

not to tell you.

to give me the key.

00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,250
Do as Mommy told you.

564
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh.

565
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,000

00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,250
Going once.

Going twice.

568
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,975
We don't have so much money.

569
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,880
150,000.

570
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,125
Forget it.

571
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,920
150,000.

572
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,175
It's in increments of 30,000.

573
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:40,719
Any more bidding?

574
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:42,755
What's wrong with your son?

575
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,254
150,000.

576
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,680
- What do you women know?

577

- He doesn't own all your money.
- 150,000 going twice.

578
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,050
You have other children.

579
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,025
Aren't they your own children?

580
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:53,900
- Shut up.
- Is there anyone who bids more?

581
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,239
Anyone who bids more?

582
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,550

Do I hear more bidding?

588
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,700
Do I?

589

180,000.

590
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,359
180,000.

591
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,040
What a lucky number!

592
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,825
180,000 from No.7.

593
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,119
180,000.

594
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,600
Anyone who bids more at the back?

595
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:23,839
Anyone who bids more than 180,000?

596

Going thrice.

601
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,225
Sold.

602
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,600
- Good.
- Good.

603
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,400
Congratulations to Mr. Rong

604
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,560
for getting the treasure.

605
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,525
We have troubles.

606
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,560
Send for a doctor.

607
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,439
Xiaojiu passed out.

608
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,479
He almost has no pulse.

609
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,075
- Yeah.
- Yes.

610
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,675
Thanks for modestly declining it.

611
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,319
You're welcome.

612
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,160
The Gold Kylin

613
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,675
must return to its owner.

614
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,560
Sure.

Congrats.

Good.

621
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,280
Hurry. Leave.

622
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,319
Why is someone shooting?

623
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,880
What's going on?

624
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,640
Leave!

625
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,900
Be careful!

626
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,082
Let's go.

627
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,280
Stop.

628
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,600
Stop!

629
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,382
Taichi.

630
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,280
- Taichi.
- Taichi.

631
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,479
- Son.
- Taichi.

632

Master.

633
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:45,625
Get out of here.

634
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,950
- No. Fanglin is still here.
- Go.

635
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,319
Get out of here.

636
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,750
Jiashang.

637
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,911
I can't watch them kill innocent people.

638
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:01,839
You leave first.

639
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,500
Jiashang.

640
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,600
Jiashang.

641
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,239
Miss Feng.

642
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,280
Don't go, will you?

643
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,400
Is Mr. Meng insane?

644
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
Many innocent people died.

645
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
How could he wind this up?

646
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,880
Miss Feng, I'm begging you.

647
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,079
Get out of here.

648
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,000
You betrayed Mr. Meng.

649
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,880
He is furious.

650
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,439
Could that be an excuse
of killing people?

651
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,640
He kills innocent people at will.

652
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,800
Are you still going to follow him?

653
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,599
Leave her alone.

654
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm here.

655
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,719
Catch Rong Jiashang.

656
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:33,280
Go.

657
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,599
- Go!
- Go!

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,450
- This way.
- Hurry.

- Boss.
- Ah?

661
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,520
Where are your wife and children?

- Hurry.
- I...

663
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,640
Go ahead. I'll save them.

664
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,250
Stop! Don't move!

665
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,640
You, don't move!

666
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,700
Stop, do you hear me?

667
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,855
- Stop!
- Stop!

668
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:53,680
Don't move!

669
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,600
Get out of my way!

670
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,700
What are you doing?

671
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,175
Shujun, Shujun.

672
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,640
Are you all right?

673
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
No, go to find Fanglin.

674
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,719
I can't live
if something happens to her.

675
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:15,599
They're coming for your family.

676
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,400
You're not safe staying here.

677
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,079
Find Fanglin. Go!

678
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,160
- Let me escort you out.
- Find Fanglin.

679
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,075
Hurry up.

680
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:21,425
- Fanglin.
- Go.

681
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:25,520
Go.

682
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,710
Go. Hurry up.

683
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,025
- Stop!
- Go away.

684
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,575
Fanghua.

685
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,475
Fanglin. You leave first.

686
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:44,199
Go to ask Uncle Zhao to help us.

687
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:46,160
No, you must leave with me.

688
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,479
Yunchi.

689
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Yunchi.

690
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,075
Let's go.

691
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,079
Follow up.

692
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,640
Guys, protect Boss.

693
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,750
- Be careful.
- Go.

694
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,359
Are you all right, Fanglin?

695
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:06,479
I'm fine.

696
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,800
Where is Fanghua?

697
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,280
Go.

698
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,439
Go.

699
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,560
- Be careful.
- They are coming.

700
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:13,719
Be careful.

701
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,680
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

702
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,359
What's wrong?

703
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,350
Where are you hurt?

704
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,839
Are you OK?

705
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,450
I'm bleeding.

706
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:26,400
Hurry. This way.

707
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,450
Hurry.

708
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,175
Help!

709
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,107
Follow up.

710
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,800
- Taichi.
- Taichi.

711

Taichi.

717

Taichi.

718
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,775
Taichi, don't die, Taichi.

719
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:49,471
- Taichi.
- Taichi.

720
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,425
Rong Jiashang.

721
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,080
I'm impressed.

722
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,080
I really underestimated you.

723
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:34,475
After killing half of my men,

724
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,650
you still stand there unhurt.

725
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,320
Tell me,

726
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:41,455
if the headline on the front page
of tomorrow's Shun Pao is

727
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,125
"Mr. Rong Jiashang

After Being Shot",

730
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:49,450
will it be dramatic?

731
00:34:49,925 --> 00:34:51,445
Meng Xu'an, you're crazy.

732
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,486
I'm not crazy.

733
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,199
I'm not the crazy one.

734
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,120
Xiaojiu,

735
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,850
didn't you tell me

736
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,525
you wanted to see your own brother?

737
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,159
He is your own brother.

738
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,600
Now you see him.

739
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,425
Is he my brother?

740
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:23,125
Yeah.

741
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,479
Then, kill him quickly.

742
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,639
Shoot him now.

743
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,239
Daddy will love me when he is dead.

744
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,479
Do it now.

745
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,060
As blood brothers,

746
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,911
don't you feel close to each other?

I've been thinking.

751
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:53,239
I want the boy

752
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,800
to meet Rong Dingkun.

753
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,479
Don't you think it's more fun

754
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:58,875
if I present him with your dead body

755
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,784
when they meet?

756
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,560
You want to kill me

757
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:08,199
and make the lunatic
the heir to the Rong family?

758
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:17,396
Meng Xu'an,

759
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,479
it turns out the whole thing
about the Gold Kylin

760
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,759
was a trap laid by you.

761
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,825
You set up the auction, too.

762
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,925
You are not bad yourself.

763
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,725
You made a fake Gold Kylin
for the auction.

764
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,399
You and your father

765
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,479
went through a lot of trouble
to find the treasure

766
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:33,479
of the Meng family.

767
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,399
I am

768
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:35,719
very grateful.

769
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,000
It's impolite not to reciprocate.

770
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,000
Tell me,

771
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,239
if I send such a big son

772
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,439
to Rong Dingkun,

773
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,360
will he shed tears

774
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,600
of gratitude?

775
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,000
An illegitimate son won't be
acknowledged by the Rong family.

776
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Mr. Meng,

777
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,690
your efforts are in vain.

778
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:58,560
Miss Feng.

779
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,800
Let them drop the guns.

780
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,479
I repeat,

781
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,280
let them drop the guns.

782
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,775
I've been thinking

783
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,175
when you will show up.

784
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:37,226
I'm disappointed in you.

785
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,971
Killing innocent people for revenge,

786
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,919
you're the one who is disappointing.

787
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,175
Jiashang, leave.

788
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:48,100
Come here.

789
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,500
Does Rong Jiashang know your secret?

790
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,875
Shut up.

791
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,700
Shizhen.

792
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,175
Come here.

793
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,350
Leave with me.

794
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:14,320
Rong Dingkun tried every means

795
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,760
to help me find the Gold Kylin.

796
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,611
Aren't you curious

797
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
what I threatened him with?

798
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:24,704
I don't care what you've got on him.

799
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,879
My father did a lot of evil things.

800
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,525
It has something to do

801
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,016
with an elder brother
and an elder sister of yours.

802
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,360
I'm the eldest son of the Rong family.

803
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,919
I don't have any
elder brothers or sisters.

804
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,439
That's what he told you?

805
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:39,175
Shut up.

806
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,520
Shizhen.

807
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,800
Come here.

808
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,800
Let's leave.

809
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:50,354
Don't move.

810
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,425
Don't move.

811
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,120
Are you all right?

812
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm fine.

813
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,040
Are you OK?

814
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,199
Get them!

815
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:16,080
Go!

816
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,700
- Yes!
- Yes!

817
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:17,650
Go.

818
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:18,875
Hurry.

819
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,159
Hurry.

820
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,100
They're coming.

821
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,450
This way, hurry!

822
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,959
Wait for me.

823
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:31,900
Be careful.

824
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,280
What are you doing?

825
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,950
- This is my car.
- Take this.

826
00:39:35,325 --> 00:39:36,705
Here are the cars. Come on.

827
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:38,879
My car! My car!

829
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,675
Hop in. Go.

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,825
Get them!

832

834

One, two.

There are two more cars.

836
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:27,400
Meng Xu'an is betting all
on a single throw this time.

837
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,360
Let's see what he can do.

838
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,239
Hold on.

839
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,500

Rong Jiashang

841
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,080
seems to be going around in circles.

842
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,199
Will there be a trap?

843
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,000
Catch up with them.

844
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:57,850
