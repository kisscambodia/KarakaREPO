Coming.

Shixun.

5
00:01:58,775 --> 00:01:59,440
Shizhen.

6
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,550
What a surprise!

7
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:02,265
Let's celebrate the New Year
as a family.

8
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,466
Great!

9
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:04,506
Come in. Come in.

10
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:05,725
I'll take your suitcase.

11
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,486
Father, Mother, guess who's coming!

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,960
Mother.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,839
Shizhen!

14
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,400
- Shizhen!
- Shizhen!

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,304
Father.

16
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,471
Did you have dinner?

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,520
I'm hungry.

18
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,559
Shixun,

19
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,524
I'd like to eat your noodle.

20
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:23,404
Sure.

21
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,600
I'll go make it.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,840
- Let me check. Did you lose weight?
- Sit down.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,075
I've put on weight.

24
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,250
Why is everybody looking at me?

25
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,344
Look at you, daughter,

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,821
you come home at the New Year Eve.

27
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:52,355
You should let us know in advance.

28
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,990
We thought you'd spend the new year
in Peking.

29
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,056
I miss you all.

30
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,530
I miss home.

31
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,051
Welcome home.

32
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:01,290
Spend more days at here.

33
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,850
Don't hurry to go.

34
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,229
Mother,

35
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,900
I've quitted my job in Peking.

36
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
From now on,

37
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,940
I'll stay with you.

38
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,639
I'll stay with the family.

39
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:14,400
What…?

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Did you

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,320
have a bad time in Peking?

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,800
Anything bad happened to you?

43
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:24,199
Mother,

44
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:26,085
Father,

45
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,330
I have something

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,480
to talk with you.

47
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,480
Go ahead.

48
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,700
I've found my biological parents.

49
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,651
But my biological father

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,280
passed away

51
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,219
like my biological mother

52
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,930
20 years ago.

53
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,389
Shizhen,

54
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,880
it's alright.

55
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,910
If they knew

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
you've grown up

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,960
to such a good girl,

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,039
they'd

59
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:11,685
be very happy.

60
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,575
Yes.

61
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:15,166
My mother has a sister.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,480
She told me all these.

63
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,271
My aunt is in Shanghai.

64
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,810
She said

65
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,486
she'd come here

66
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:24,679
to visit you.

67
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,925
- She's welcome.
- Great.

68
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,630
Shizhen, this is good news.

69
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,675
Go tell her,

70
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
the family welcomes her.

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,797
We're looking forward

72
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:35,277
to a family reunion.

73
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,440
Yes.

74
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,959
Thank you, Mother.

75
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,270
Get out of here.

76
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:48,950
Yes.

77
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,775
What do you want?

78
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,044
Who is the dead body in Wenchunli?

79
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,685
I want the truth.

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,779
If you have the time,

81
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,720
think about

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
how to make money for the company

83
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,295
rather than the rubbish.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,075
Are you Qin Shuigen?

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,560
Qin Shuigen?

86
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,239
Qin Shuigen.

87
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:36,426
Qin Shuigen.

88
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,575
Do you know?

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,300
Bai's daughter is alive.

90
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:55,959
Can't be!

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,050
I saw her fall into water.

92
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,250
She survived.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,760
She's back for revenge.

94
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,255
Father,

95
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,795
tell me everything about Wenchunli.

96
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,550
Tell me what happened there.

97
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,336
What does she want?

98
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,899
She wrote the IOU.

99
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,640
Tell me what she wants.

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Father,

101
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,350
don't hide it from me.

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,199
Tell me the truth,

103
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,915
or I will ask Uncle Zhao.

104
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:28,475
He would put all the blames

105
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,755
on you, though,

106
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:30,835
I can still

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,719
make out the truth.

108
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,860
Zhao Hua'an is not a simple man.

109
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,524
Don't trust a single word of him.

110
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,940
He's ambitious.

111
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,580
He wants to take your place.

112
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,359
Father,

113
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,485
he knows too much about you.

114
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:54,165
It's easy for him to hurt you
and our family.

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,399
But I am ignorant of this.

116
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,621
I don't know how to defend.

117
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,350
Know yourself,

118
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,704
know your enemy.

119
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,235
Tell me the truth,

120
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,290
for the family's sake.

121
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,490
My mother died

122
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,720
when I was young.

123
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,770
I lived as a mason.

124
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,535
Zhao Hua'an was no better than me.

125
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:56,365
We decided

126
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:58,915
to do some business.

127
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,950
We traded imported goods

128
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,236
to scrap a meager living.

129
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,640
Later,

130
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,050
we met He,

131
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,650
who was the real Rong Dingkun.

132
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:18,800
It was interesting that

133
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:22,725
we were neither kith nor kin
but looked very alike.

134
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:25,300
He was a good man,

135
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,959
kindhearted,

136
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,440
loyal to friends,

137
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,959
and

138
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,386
paid off my debts.

139
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,650
We became sworn brothers.

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Men

141
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,300
may be good to you,

142
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,960
but not always.

143
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:56,624
In three days,

144
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:57,824
I will have my money,

145
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:58,775
or I will

146
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,000
have your hand.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,159
Please help me!

148
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,029
Ma Laojiu said

149
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,469
if I can't pay the debt,

150
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:06,108
he'll take my hand.

151
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
300.

152
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,666
I need just 300.

153
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,420
Bro,

154
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,800
I can't help you.

155
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,215
My wife is having a baby.

156
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,219
She's coming to Shanghai.

157
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,320
I have to settle them down.

158
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,275
I don't have extra money.

159
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,150
He won the lottery, 1,000 yuan.

160
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:35,444
He had the money but didn't help me.

161
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,361
He'd rather watch them chop my hand.

162
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,530
And he blamed me

163
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,171
for breaking the rules.

164
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,220
We all make a living in the dock.

165
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,800
Nobody has clean hands.

166
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,760
I just got something

167
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,800
from Ma Laojiu and I failed

168
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,025
in selling them.

169
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,384
So you killed him?

170
00:09:56,384 --> 00:09:58,475
He forced me to.

171
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Who are you?

172
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,225
Shuigen?

173
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:29,975
What are you doing?

174
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,025
You're taking my lottery!

175
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,575
I've been so good to you.

176
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:38,760
How can you do this to me?

177
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,799
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

178
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,479
Go!

179
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,599
I'll take you to the police.

180
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,675
No!

181
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,425
Go!

182
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,350
To the police! Go!

183
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:03,274
Bro, are you crazy?

184
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:06,700
Bro,

185
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,905
don't tell a word of this!

186
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,025
You'll have half of the lottery.

187
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,650
What about him?

188
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,625
We've got too many lodgers here.

189
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,095
They'll see the body.

190
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,700
How do you hide it?

191
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,150
The wall.

192
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,365
So you sealed him up in the wall?

193
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,435
Or what should I do?

194
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,860
I can't afford the risk.

195
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,979
I can't afford the risk

196
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:46,125
to move his body.

197
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,250
I sealed him up

198
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,900
in the wall.

199
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,326
At the night,

200
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,026
I disguised as him

201
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,475
and told the neighbors

202
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,400
I'd go visit my hometown.

203
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,570
They believed he had gone.

204
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,275
Nobody noticed anything.

205
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,875
Then I disguised as Rong Dingkun

206
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,225
and cashed the lottery.

207
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,675
It was then that I knew

208
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,674
he had written home

209
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,625
about the lottery.

210
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,575
His wife and parents were coming to him.

211
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,570
I talked with Zhao Hua'an that

212
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:38,085
though we looked very alike,

213
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,660
I wouldn't fool his wife and parents.

214
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,859
I can't do this by half.

215
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,784
So I killed

216
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,025
them all.

217
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:54,054
So

218
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,325
you're Qin Shuigen.

219
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,330
Yes.

220
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,179
That woman

221
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:09,799
was so stupid.

222
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:13,475
She didn't recognize her own husband.

223
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,450
I… I stabbed her twice.

224
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:19,435
I stabbed her to death.

225
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,206
And her family…

226
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,350
It was so easy.

227
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,925
I found a cloth

228
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
of a plague patient.

229
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,181
They all died.

230
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,075
Were you crazy?

231
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,635
You'd have hidden somewhere

232
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:44,650
for a while.

233
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,154
Why did you do that?

234
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,900
I didn't have the time.

235
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,860
If I didn't do that,

236
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,050
how could I marry your mother?

237
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:55,845
If I didn't do that,

238
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,729
how could I have you?

239
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,200
But…

240
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,820
I cut the weeds
and didn't dig out the roots.

241
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,760
I saw

242
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:19,025
that girl fell into water.

243
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,230
Zhao Hua'an said

244
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:23,755
"she couldn't survive!

245
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,400
she couldn't survive!"

246
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,470
We went to the police
and didn't see her body.

247
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,381
I thought she was eaten by wild dogs.

248
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,100
I forgot her.

249
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,275
Now!

250
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,909
Look at it now!

251
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,425
She comes back

252
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,125
for revenge!

253
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,296
It was Zhao Hua'an!

254
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,099
Zhao Hua'an pushed me into this.

255
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,650
You killed him

256
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,580
and tell me he forced you to.

257
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,119
She comes back for revenge

258
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,239
and you blame Zhao Hua'an
for not having killed them all!

259
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,000
You have blood on your hands

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,721
and you stand clear of all these

261
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,644
and blame others.

262
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,685
You are the innocent.

263
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,020
Have you ever thought of the victims?

264
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,526
They were not guilty!

265
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,086
They were innocent!

266
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,905
And the girl who survived,

267
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:23,715
she did nothing wrong

268
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,275
but has to take the hatred

269
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,875
and live in pain!

270
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,770
Isn't she innocent?

271
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,075
You traitor!

272
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,125
I brought you to this world!

273
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,975
I'd rather I was not born!

274
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,370
For 20 years, you've been

275
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,850
playing Rong Dingkun.

276
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,400
It's time to end all these

277
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,576
and be yourself.

278
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,100
Get out!

279
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,709
A sextant?

280
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,875
Navigators in the past

281
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,525
used the sextant to locate the bearings.

282
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,425
You told me

283
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,325
that you wanted to be a pilot.

284
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:57,719
I hope one day,

285
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,678
you can bravely chase your dream

286
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
and be a free and fearless pilot

287
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,325
high up in the sky.

288
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,999
When I

289
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,925
first saw you in the dancing hall,

290
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,886
I didn't know who you were,

291
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:14,225
but I knew I'm in love

292
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,209
with you.

293
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:41,300
I thought

294
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,800
between you and me was the bloodline.

295
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,600
I didn't know it was a blood debt.

296
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,520
How could I face you?

297
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,850
We…

298
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,725
What shall I do?

299
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:02,800
Are we finished?

300
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,925
Shizhen told us

301
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,300
you'll visit us.

302
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,200
We've been

303
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,999
looking forward to it.

304
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,425
Hope I didn't ruin your new year.

305
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:21,750
Not at all.

306
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:22,800
We're family.

307
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,961
You're welcome.

308
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:26,114
May I

309
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:28,514
call you Sister Feng?

310
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,431
You're really nice people.

311
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,050
You've taught Shizhen so well.

312
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,460
I…

313
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,775
I will

314
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,650
enshrine you at home,

315
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,255
offer incense,

316
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,984
and pray to Buddha for your family.

317
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:51,000
Wish you good luck

318
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,500
and fortune.

319
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:53,744
Ms. Qian,

320
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,281
you flattered us.

321
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,375
Shizhen

322
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,140
is our daughter.

323
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,304
We love her very much.

324
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:01,944
We're a family.

325
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,264
Yes.

326
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,099
Shizhen,

327
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:06,259
lead your aunt to the table.

328
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:07,425
Yes.

329
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:08,479
Aunt,

330
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,439
Mother,

331
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,225
dinner time.

332
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:10,850
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

333
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,425
Coming.

334
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:17,079
Dinner is ready.

335
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,075
Tonight

336
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,036
there's a lantern show in Zhaofeng Park.

337
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,884
After the dinner,

338
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,426
let's go have a look,

339
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,475
shall we?

340
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:27,475
- Great.
- Great.

341
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,221
Look at this.

342
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,000
It's beautiful!

343
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:36,800
This one.

344
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,839
How much is it?

345
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,319
This is good, too.

346
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,800
Shixun, look at that lanterns.

347
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,490
We saw them when we were little.

348
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,150
A long row of them.

349
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,674
When they were little,

350
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:04,233
in the new year,

351
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,275
we brought them to the lantern show.

352
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,471
At that time,

353
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,111
Shixun loves roast chestnuts,

354
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,264
- and Shizhen
- Yes, yes.

355
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,870
was crazy for ice cream.

356
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,040
Yes, yes.

357
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,500
The boy and girl begged me.

358
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,064
They wouldn't go until

359
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:18,475
they got what they wanted.

360
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:20,950
Kids are always greedy.

361
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,080
- They got me greedy now.
- This is amazing.

362
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,875
Shixun, I want some roast chestnut.

363
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:27,775
Go for it.

364
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:32,800
All yours.

365
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,075
It's good to have a brother.

366
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:35,600
Flatterer. Go get it.

367
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,640
Keep going with them.

368
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,280
Sure.

369
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,385
Don't waste your holiday at home.

370
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,850
Alcohol is something

371
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,940
that pleases you.

372
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,250
But don't indulge in it.

373
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:48,455
If you miss her,

374
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,450
go to her.

375
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:53,725
- Hello, I want a pack of this.
- Yes.

376
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,700
See her or not see her,

377
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
what's the difference?

378
00:20:58,575 --> 00:20:59,575
You always tell the opposite

379
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,125
of what you want.

380
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,245
Come to me if you like.

381
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:05,075
New Metropolis has lots of fun.

382
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,450
Hey.

383
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,650
Shizhen.

384
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,550
Happy New Year.

385
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,575
How are you doing?

386
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:12,485
Is your father well?

387
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,850
He's fine.

388
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,120
He quit opium.

389
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,635
Now he gets better.

390
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:22,325
My aunt joined us.

391
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,551
This new year

392
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,416
is not bad.

393
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:30,900
Will you

394
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:34,025
go back to Peking?

395
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,375
No, I won't.

396
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:43,956
I have my job in Shanghai.

397
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,625
The phone call…

398
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,675
I should have known it.

399
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,116
So what?

400
00:22:58,525 --> 00:22:59,875
It makes no difference.

401
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:04,975
The IOU…

402
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,100
Did he get it?

403
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,600
He did.

404
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,875
So…

405
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,250
he didn't acknowledge?

406
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:39,584
It doesn't matter.

407
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:41,506
God

408
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,615
is watching.

409
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,350
Sooner or later

410
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,575
it will be paid off.

411
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,015
He didn't acknowledge,

412
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:51,875
but I do.

413
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,471
I apologize for my father's sins.

414
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:00,254
I'll pay my father's debt.

415
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,841
It's a natural thing.

416
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,925
You can't choose your parents.

417
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,575
I don't blame you.

418
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:16,825
But

419
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,475
we can't be together.

420
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,175
Time to say goodbye.

421
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,179
Shizhen,

422
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,575
I'll make my father acknowledge.

423
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,630
On the 11th of next month,

424
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,150
Fanghua and Yunchi will get married.

425
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,111
They'll live abroad then.

426
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,150
And I'll

427
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,975
send Fanglin to school with them.

428
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:58,775
Then I'll hold a press conference.

429
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:01,550
I'll make my father

430
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,825
acknowledge all his debts.

431
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,350
I'm tired of all these.

432
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,875
I used to believe

433
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:18,350
though Rong's business was a shame,

434
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:21,775
my father fought for it.

435
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:24,714
I'm the heir

436
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,920
and I should carry it on.

437
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,950
I didn't know the Rongs…

438
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,520
no,

439
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,550
the Qins…

440
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:43,700
Every piece of the Qin's brick

441
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,575
has the Rong's blood on it.

442
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,650
And I…

443
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,850
I grew up by sucking their blood.

444
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm afraid of going to that house.

445
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,839
I'm afraid that

446
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,590
I'll smell the blood once I get in.

447
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,300
I always think

448
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,859
the wall

449
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,200
has more dead bodies in it.

450
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:19,425
Jiashang.

451
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,500
Don't pity me.

452
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,316
Every time I go home,

453
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,070
I see my father lying in bed

454
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,275
with opium.

455
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,950
He's like a ghost.

456
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,609
I'm afraid one day

457
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,150
I'll become him.

458
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,450
This is not my life.

459
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,451
Ah,

460
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,599
the sextant you gave to me

461
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:48,384
is always on my desk.

462
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,416
Every time I see it,

463
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:52,875
it reminds me of what you said to me,

464
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,115
and reminds me

465
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,250
of the beautiful wishes.

466
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,740
But I always let you down.

467
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:10,950
Shizhen,

468
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,850
take care of yourself.

469
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:18,725
I hope one day

470
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:21,400
I could stand before you,
clear and clean.

471
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:26,850
Good bye.

472
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:28,150
Go tell Master.

473
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:28,775
Yes.

474
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:40,825
What's it?

475
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,100
The hospital called.

476
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:52,350
Young master

477
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,425
is gone.

478
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:14,450
Master!

479
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,025
Master, young master is gone.

480
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,611
Jiakang!

481
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:15,325
Mother's taking you home.

482
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,894
Mother's taking you home.

483
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:24,775
Let's go home.

484
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,450
I'm sorry, Concubine Sun.

485
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,225
Please give him to me.

486
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,546
Excuse me.

487
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:34,500
No! No! No!

488
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,825
- He's sleeping!
- Sis.

489
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,075
- Give him to me. He's sleeping!
- It's alright.

490
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:39,950
It's alright.

491
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:42,885
This is fate.

492
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,476
Weeping and mourning

493
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,075
won't bring him back.

494
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,275
Don't cry.

495
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,030
Calm down.

496
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,319
Don't cry. Take care of yourself.

497
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
He's my son,

498
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,750
not yours!

499
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,675
Of course you don't care about him!

500
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:00,359
You…!

501
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,640
Ma'am.

502
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,959
So ungrateful!

503
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:05,160
Let's go!

504
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,040
Go!

505
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,175
He died too young.

506
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,575
There's no grand funeral.

507
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,076
Get some men

508
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,575
and bury him soon.

509
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:28,400
Yes.

510
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:34,075
Sister,

511
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,125
you've got to face it.

512
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,170
Don't cry.

513
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,875
Let him go.

514
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,801
You have a long life

515
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,220
ahead of you.

516
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,575
Jiakang is gone.

517
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,705
He was my only son.

518
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:57,075
Master is in this condition.

519
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,700
He can't give me another son.

520
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:03,854
Without a son,

521
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,950
I don't have

522
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,849
a future in this house.

523
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:17,806
Sister,

524
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,150
everyone knows

525
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,775
Master is dying.

526
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,570
Mr. Jiashang takes the wheel
for the family.

527
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:29,975
Mr. Jiashang is cold,

528
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,575
but he's responsible

529
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,425
for the younger brother and sisters

530
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,699
and the family relatives.

531
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,859
I think

532
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,584
he will be good to you.

533
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,459
I failed

534
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,081
to save your son.

535
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,950
Sorry.

536
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,520
Miss Feng.

537
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,560
Let me.

538
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:26,079
Miss Feng,

539
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,000
I drove your aunt
to the railway station yesterday.

540
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
She'll be in Guangzhou in a few days.

541
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,599
She's fine.

542
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,638
Thank you, Wen.

543
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:32,850
My pleasure, Miss Feng.

544
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:34,875
Give it to me.

545
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,229
Thank you.

546
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,351
Do they agree

547
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:54,135
you live in Baoli's apartment?

548
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,410
I told them Baoli needs an assistant.

549
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:00,125
Shixun begged them for me.

550
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,726
They approved.

551
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:03,915
Your brother

552
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,600
is an open-minded man.

553
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:07,989
Ah, yes,

554
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,350
is he

555
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:10,469
interested in politics?

556
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:13,025
Recently he's close to

557
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:14,025
some progressive youth.

558
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,175
Did he tell you

559
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:17,815
he joined some society?

560
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:20,356
He doesn't talk about that.

561
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,866
Is there anything wrong?

562
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,684
Not yet.

563
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:27,445
How about

564
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,790
I keep an eye on him?

565
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,509
Should anything happen,

566
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,590
I'll let you know soon.

567
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:36,005
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

568
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,350
Don't worry too much.

569
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:52,826
Did you read the news today?

570
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:54,360
Nope.

571
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,439
At 7:00 AM,

572
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,460
Commander Cao and Commander Ma

573
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,151
started a war at Dongpoping.

574
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,239
Good start of the year.

575
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,679
I can't wait to see.

576
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,615
For the commanders,

577
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,625
war is part of their life.

578
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:08,096
Think about it,

579
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:09,256
they're good for nothing.

580
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,219
Newspapers always exaggerate.

581
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:14,600
Are the wars so violent?

582
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:15,606
The truth is

583
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,639
none of them would

584
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,175
spend on civil war.

585
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,546
The soldiers are reluctant to shoot,

586
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:23,875
not to mention combat.

587
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:26,075
Men talk about fighting and killing.

588
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,415
I'm out.

589
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:30,439
Shizhen,

590
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,875
in fact this has

591
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:39,225
something to do with the Rongs.

592
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,120
You mean the Rongs

593
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,050
supply arms to Commander Cao?

594
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,000
More than that.

595
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,741
They're closely related to the Mas.

596
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,040
I know it.

597
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:56,025
Zhao Hua'an plotted this.

598
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:57,305
But Rong Jiashang

599
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,800
is not clean of this.

600
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,444
Mr. Meng,

601
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,250
I've made a decision.

602
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:04,424
Rong Jiashang

603
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:05,600
and Zhao Hua'an

604
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,439
make no difference

605
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,425
to me.

606
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,399
Mr. Yang,

607
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,800
share what you've got.

608
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:15,719
Apparently,

609
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,164
Rong Jiashang

610
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:18,399
is at the helm.

611
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:20,835
Actually most of the businesses

612
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,325
in his hands

613
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,250
are lawful businesses.

614
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:29,204
Of course,

615
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,025
this is because the Wenchunli incident

616
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,454
has consumed all the cash

617
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:35,479
available to Rong Jiashang.

618
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,975
The Rong's moneymakers,

619
00:36:38,325 --> 00:36:41,159
arms, opium and antique trafficking,

620
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,290
are controlled by Zhao Hua'an

621
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:45,465
and some crafty assistant managers.

622
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,086
Rong Jiashang
is seemingly sitting in glory,

623
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,125
which actually tortures him.

624
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,000
Rong's Company's large shareholders

625
00:36:57,425 --> 00:36:59,600
started a war because of

626
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,679
the Wenchunli incident.

627
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,895
Many of them withdrew their shares.

628
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,221
The rest of them are

629
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:07,465
forcing Rong Jiashang to split the cake

630
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,675
and are fighting for profitable shares.

631
00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:13,625
The information I got this time

632
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,081
is a bit strange.

633
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,100
Why is it?

634
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,019
The information is reliable.

635
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,696
Both Commander Cao and Commander Ma

636
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,750
are using the arms supplied
by Zhao Hua'an.

637
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,679
Technically,

638
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,625
the Rongs are in internal conflicts.

639
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,775
It can't coordinate and supply

640
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:37,374
a huge amount of arms in a short time,

641
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,550
not even in its heyday,

642
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,700
since the shareholders are
friendly foes.

643
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,020
It doesn't have the efficiency.

644
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,050
It's strange that

645
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,774
how Zhao Hua'an did it.

646
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,830
After Qin Shuigen fell ill,

647
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,949
he's more cautious of Rong Jiashang.

648
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,289
Is it possible that

649
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,125
the one behind Zhao Hua'an,

650
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,325
or

651
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:02,825
the one who helps him

652
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,889
is Qin Shuigen?

653
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,280
He has but one purpose.

654
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,959
He will retake the rule

655
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,350
as soon as possible

656
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:11,800
from Rong Jiashang.

657
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,525
He is

658
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,341
always coldblooded.

659
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:16,904
He shows no mercy

660
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,979
even to Rong Jiashang.

661
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,740
Qin Shuigen

662
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,175
has many old followers.

663
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,040
Zhao Hua'an is not the best,

664
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,719
but the most trusted.

665
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,025
I agree with Mr. Meng.

666
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,690
The one behind

667
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:37,475
is Qin Shuigen.

668
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,821
It's not about trust.

669
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,595
These two men

670
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,311
know each other's secret.

671
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,890
They share a balance of interests.

672
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,700
They're two-in-one.

673
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:50,994
In Rong's house today,

674
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,239
Zhao Hua'an

675
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,325
is next only to one man.

676
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,879
If Qin Shuigen does not

677
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,350
try to coordinate the powers,

678
00:38:59,825 --> 00:39:00,719
soon

679
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:02,915
they'll collapse from inside.

680
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,725
Mr. Meng suggests

681
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:05,986
we make unrest

682
00:39:06,275 --> 00:39:08,115
and make the Rongs' seniors believe

683
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:10,276
Zhao Hua'an wants to take power,

684
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,355
and heat up their ambitions.

685
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:14,120
And then

686
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,640
break up their family.

687
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:19,280
That's right.

688
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,775
I've considered

689
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,530
Miss Feng's idea.

690
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,335
But the current situation is

691
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:28,384
Zhao Hua'an

692
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:30,225
is loyal to the Rong's family.

693
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:35,560
Zhao Hua'an has a trump card.

694
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,746
What's it?

695
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:37,975
He has a henchman

696
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,425
at the high level in the south.

697
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,439
That man has the code book

698
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:42,425
of the transport corps.

699
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,360
That's to say,

700
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:45,435
only he and his henchman

701
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:46,556
know where the corps is,

702
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:47,925
where it is going,

703
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,900
and where it delivers.

704
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:52,320
Qin Shuigen had a code book.

705
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:55,125
I suppose Rong Jiashang's taking it.

706
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,700
I know that code book.

707
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,150
Is it the one I decoded?

708
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,211
Yes.

709
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,085
Miss Feng decoded it

710
00:40:03,085 --> 00:40:04,444
and they changed the code.

711
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,205
The most important thing is

712
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,605
Zhao Hua'an

713
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,165
has the code only known to him.

714
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,229
The code for his own corps.

715
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
He's not the only one.

716
00:40:14,775 --> 00:40:16,735
All the other gang managers

717
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:18,244
have their own businesses.

718
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,674
Sometimes they embezzle Rong's goods

719
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,289
for private profits.

720
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,209
It has been Qin Shuigen's long headache.

721
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,520
Well,

722
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,205
can you get the code,

723
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,875
Mr. Yang?

724
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:32,525
Very possible.

725
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:34,050
By telegram interception.

726
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,525
But it takes time

727
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,184
to decode it.

728
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:39,345
That's my job.

729
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:40,575
The key is

730
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,441
we should get that code book.

731
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,520
Miss Feng is good at this.

732
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,320
I admire that.

733
00:40:48,975 --> 00:40:49,675
Alright,

734
00:40:50,175 --> 00:40:51,254
I'll work on this.

735
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:52,050
Em.

736
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:00,360
Any comment, Mr. Meng?

737
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:04,066
It sounds like a plan.

738
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:06,066
Just do it.

739
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,190
I have one concern,

740
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,650
or scruple.

741
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,360
The man you love might get hurt.

742
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,370
There is no more a tie between us.

743
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,320
What's more,

744
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,040
he's a man.

745
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,600
