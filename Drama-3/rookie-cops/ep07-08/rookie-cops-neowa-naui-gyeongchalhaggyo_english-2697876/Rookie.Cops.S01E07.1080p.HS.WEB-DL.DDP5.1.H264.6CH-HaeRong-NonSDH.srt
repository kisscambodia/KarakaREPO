5 WAYS NOT TO FAIL YOUR FIRST KISS

3
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:26,488
<i>I once read from a book</i>

4
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,118
<i>that the moment comes at unexpected times.</i>

5
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,088
Yes!

6
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,518
<i>And that I shouldn't avoid it.</i>

7
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,118
An eyelash.

8
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:20,338
I must have lost my mind...

9
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:56,748
An eyelash.

10
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,718
<i>That night,
someone was excited...</i>

11
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:15,098
NEW YORK SCHOOL OF FASHION ART

12
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:31,198
<i>...while someone else was
preparing a goodbye.</i>

13
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:34,738
So when are you leaving?

14
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,368
After this semester.

15
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:39,868
Are you sure you won't regret this?

16
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:42,328
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,958
It may be late,

18
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,378
but I want to do what I want.

19
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:07,278
<i>As the flowers bloom and wither,
spring was also leaving campus.</i>

20
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:22,168
EPISODE 7

21
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:25,338
<i>Freshmen,
assemble in the yard immediately.</i>

22
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:30,418
<i>Freshmen, put your uniforms on
and assemble in the yard in five minutes.</i>

23
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:34,298
Tak.

24
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:37,468
Tak.

25
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,428
Hey. Get up.

26
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:42,888
Get changed.

27
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:11,338
Hey. It's an emergency muster.

28
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,258
So it wasn't a dream.

29
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:15,588
Hurry up.

30
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,398
Gosh!

31
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:31,028
Hey, Juyoung. Get up!

32
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,398
It's 3 a.m., and we need to assemble.
Come on. Hurry.

33
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,068
We need to hurry.

34
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:49,588
Run!

35
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:19,868
BE A WARNING TO THE PEOPLE

36
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:39,468
Hey, Daeil.

37
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,238
I said, five minutes!

38
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:06,538
Sorry, sir!

39
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:08,458
Lazy bastards.

40
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:17,918
You. What's this?

41
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:22,298
Right. I was rushing and...

42
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:24,888
You get ten penalty points
and the rest gets five.

43
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:27,678
Hand in a report on it
by the end of today. Understood?

44
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:28,938
Yes, sir!

45
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:44,988
Where's Ari?

46
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:46,908
She went back to sleep again.

47
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:48,868
I didn't get any sleep either.

48
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,868
I'm glad my classes are in the afternoon.

49
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,208
If I had morning classes,
it would've been horrible.

50
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:57,168
I hate that darn emergency muster.

51
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,418
It'll be the first thing I abolish
once I become a senior.

52
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,048
I want to abolish the penalty system.

53
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:05,048
I'm so sick of it.
I'm becoming a slave to penalty points.

54
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:06,098
Mm-hm.

55
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:08,178
I already got 45 points.

56
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,938
At this rate, it'll reach 100 in no time.

57
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,978
Mine is much worse.

58
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,058
I got over 70 points.

59
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,818
I heard the penalty points
would affect our grades too.

60
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,408
We're in serious trouble.

61
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,038
Oh. Hey, Seunghyun.

62
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,458
I need to hand in a report.

63
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,418
Could you bring this
to Insik's room later?

64
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,418
Okay.

65
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:43,378
-What did you order?
-I ordered some books online.

66
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,798
WI SEUNGHYUN

67
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,138
Hey.

68
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,598
-This is yours. Here.
-Thanks.

69
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:02,858
What was that?

70
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,238
Did something happen between you two?

71
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,618
What do you mean? Nothing happened.

72
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:09,488
Then why can't you look at each other?

73
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:13,868
Maybe he has a sty.

74
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:16,668
I guess so.

75
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:18,998
What's that?

76
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,268
Wow.

77
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,058
She's indeed
a science high school graduate.

78
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:37,188
-She went to a science high school?
-You didn't know?

79
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,568
She's definitely
a science high school graduate.

80
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:49,368
There.

81
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,208
Sports festival?

82
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:57,208
We're having
Cheongram Sports Festival soon.

83
00:08:57,288 --> 00:09:00,168
I heard they're going to film it
with the drone and post it online.

84
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,878
Oh, so you're in charge of this?

85
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,088
Yes. Ari will be commentating,
and I'll control the drone.

86
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:08,008
A drone for a school festival?
That's too much.

87
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:09,008
Mm-mm.

88
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:11,638
It's not too much.
It's the school's biggest event.

89
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,768
Especially you, Eunkang,
have to put everything into this festival.

90
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:16,938
Huh?

91
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,938
It's a golden opportunity
to make a fresh start.

92
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,768
The winner gets 100 points.

93
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:25,148
That's more than enough
to deduct all the penalty points you got.

94
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,448
You can deduct your penalty points
with the prize points.

95
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:29,568
Did you know this?

96
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,368
Does it matter?

97
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:34,538
It won't be easy to win.

98
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:54,518
I should at least join a team
that has a good chance,

99
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,348
but that's not something I can control.

100
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,688
<i>A team that has a good chance?
Is there a front-running team?</i>

101
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,898
<i>There is.</i>

102
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:04,398
<i>Which team is that?</i>

103
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:06,488
<i>The best team is...</i>

104
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,948
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

105
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,448
<i>...either one of the two.</i>

106
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:16,328
<i>First, Student Squad One,
where Jang Juchan is the leader.</i>

107
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,788
<i>He brings his team together
with his smooth leadership skills,</i>

108
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,458
<i>which is why his team has good teamwork.</i>

109
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,538
GENTLE YET STRONG LEADERSHIP
JANG JUCHAN

110
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:26,048
<i>But it doesn't mean he's always so gentle.</i>

111
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:33,928
<i>He's as hard as nails
when it comes to competition.</i>

112
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:39,268
<i>Juchan's team has always won.</i>

113
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,018
<i>But this year's game
will be hard to predict.</i>

114
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:45,478
<i>Because he and his legendary partner
are on different teams.</i>

115
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:47,648
<i>"Legendary partner"?</i>

116
00:10:57,748 --> 00:10:58,948
KNPU KENDO CLUB

117
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:00,118
Head!

118
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,748
-Head!
-Head!

119
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:08,548
<i>-Juchan's archrival...</i>
-Head!

120
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:10,718
<i>...Um Hyuk of Student Squad Two.</i>

121
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,428
A COOL HEAD AND POWERFUL CHARISMA
UM HYUK

122
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,348
<i>As you know, he's really good
at pushing people.</i>

123
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:19,138
<i>He pushes his team to the limit
and brings out the best in them.</i>

124
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,388
<i>He's like a general.</i>

125
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:26,268
<i>And Hyuk has two reliable assistants,
Sunyu and Insik.</i>

126
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,148
<i>Sunyu has always been</i>

127
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:31,318
<i>the winner of women's triathlon
since she entered the school.</i>

128
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,108
<i>She's the ace of KNPU.</i>

129
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,798
So we should join one of the two.

130
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,758
-How do we do that?
-It's obvious.

131
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:58,468
We...

132
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,428
-don't have a choice.
-Damn it.

133
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:03,808
We'll be sorted
by our rooms automatically.

134
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,518
2017 CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL
PARTICIPANTS LIST

135
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:06,898
There's my name.

136
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:09,318
STUDENT SQUAD 1, JANG JUCHAN

137
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,858
WI SEUNGHYUN, KIM TAK
KO EUNKANG, GI HANNA

138
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,778
I'm on
the same team as Tak.

139
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:15,488
I'm so jealous.

140
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,618
STUDENT SQUAD 2, UM HYUK

141
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,788
YOO DAEIL, SEO BUMJU
SHIN ARI, WOO JUYOUNG

142
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:23,458
-You're so lucky.
-Good luck.

143
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,088
KIM TAK
GI HANNA

144
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,878
WI SEUNGHYUN
KO EUNKANG

145
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,758
-We're on the same team.
-Of course. We're roommates.

146
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:39,678
What?

147
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,428
Of course. Right.

148
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,268
Let's crush them all.

149
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:44,268
Okay.

150
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:49,058
<i>None of that matters.</i>

151
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:52,228
No matter how good the guys are,
the women's games are the most important.

152
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:55,278
Even if the men win all the games
like volleyball, rugby, and trench fight,

153
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,778
if their female teammates suck
at the triathlon, they'll all lose.

154
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,698
The points you can get from women's games
are more than twice as high.

155
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,908
That's why the guys train
their female teammates.

156
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,918
Wait. Then who gives the training?

157
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:09,498
Depends on the team.
Your team might assign a trainer to you.

158
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,248
Or maybe you can ask someone personally.

159
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:15,008
Why? Is there someone
you'd like to train with?

160
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:17,008
No. But I know
who I don't want to do it with.

161
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,178
Yoo Daeil and Seo Bumju.

162
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,678
Those weaklings are on my team.
Seriously. Can you believe it?

163
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,928
-What about you? Who will you ask?
-Me?

164
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:27,138
I'm not sure.

165
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,778
Hanna?

166
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,858
It'd be nice if one of her colleagues
could take her.

167
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:41,828
As you know, none of the seniors
want to take her.

168
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:44,158
Many of them still don't like her.

169
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,578
I'd love to do it myself,

170
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,918
but I don't have much time
to prepare for it.

171
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:49,918
Hmm...

172
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,998
-Would that be difficult?
-No, sir. Anything for the team.

173
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:56,508
Thanks, Seunghyun.

174
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:20,108
My. Who should I ask?

175
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,988
Maybe not one of the seniors.
I might not be comfortable with them.

176
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,788
I guess I should ask one of my colleagues.

177
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:26,618
No. Seniors will be better.

178
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:30,168
Are we meeting in front of the dorm
after class tomorrow?

179
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,078
-Yes.
-Okay. I'll see you then.

180
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,718
-Are you helping her with the training?
-Yes.

181
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,928
Man. You're a hero.

182
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,738
Professor Cha wants to see you
after class.

183
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,278
Okay. Thanks.

184
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,498
SCHOOL RECORDS
NAME: KIM TAK

185
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:19,418
Come in.

186
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:26,718
We managed to smooth
it over this time,

187
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:29,678
but don't you ever let others
provoke you again.

188
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:32,098
You even got accepted
through special admission for athletes.

189
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:33,348
You need to be extra careful.

190
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,268
Your one mistake can abolish
the special admission.

191
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:39,778
-I'll keep that in mind, sir.
-Those who work in uniform...

192
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:41,738
should always be careful.

193
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:44,988
-That's the weight of responsibility.
-Yes, sir.

194
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,828
I checked your school records.

195
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,408
You played judo in high school.

196
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,248
Why did you decide to come to KNPU?

197
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:56,838
-My brother went to this school.
-Is your brother a graduate here?

198
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,458
He didn't graduate.

199
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,468
A week before he graduated,

200
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,598
he had died in an accident.
That's ten years ago.

201
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:26,738
5, UGAE-RO 25-GIL,
GIMHAE, GYEONGNAM PROVINCE

202
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:28,448
Is your brother's name...

203
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,038
Kim Hyunsoo?

204
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,368
Do you know my brother?

205
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,258
SUMMER 2006

206
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:47,338
My parents passed away.

207
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,008
Is that so? I didn't know.

208
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:52,768
It's okay, sir.

209
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,058
Are you alone then?

210
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:58,608
No, sir. I have a grandmother
and a little brother in Gimhae.

211
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:01,358
My!
You're the breadwinner.

212
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,278
-Eat up.
-It's okay, sir. This is enough for me.

213
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,858
Come on. Eat more.

214
00:17:05,948 --> 00:17:08,488
Hey. He'll be watching
the security cameras all night.

215
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,028
Being full will only make him sleepy.

216
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,078
Sir.

217
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:17,708
Don't you think you're being
too harsh on him?

218
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,668
Look at his eyes. They're all red.

219
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,338
He's been watching
the security cameras for days.

220
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,458
Then you do it.

221
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,088
Oh, no. A mosquito.

222
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,178
By the way, sir.

223
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,928
Which class were you in?

224
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:37,438
Don't suck up to me
because we went to the same school.

225
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:40,228
Nepotism is what I hate the most.

226
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:42,068
Sorry, sir.

227
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,318
-If you're done, go make some coffee.
-Yes, sir.

228
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:56,118
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

229
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:29,358
It's hot. Careful.

230
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:30,408
Thank you, sir.

231
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,278
How are you doing?

232
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:34,948
I'm a sergeant on my last leg.

233
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,118
I'm also graduating soon,
so I have a lot of free time.

234
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:39,918
Right, sir.

235
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:42,498
I heard you're on
Seoul's Drug Investigations Unit.

236
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:44,288
I head from Constable Park.

237
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,338
-I talk to him from time to time.
-Mm-hm.

238
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,338
I see.

239
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,548
By the way,

240
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:51,838
why did you...

241
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,268
Hyunsoo.

242
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,228
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,238
My name is Kim Hyunsoo,
and I'm a fourth-year law student at KNPU.

244
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,118
Good.

245
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,948
Lieutenant Cha told me about you.

246
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:22,168
He said you're a brilliant
and responsible person.

247
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,498
I'm flattered, sir.

248
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,338
We're planning an operation.

249
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:47,478
THE LATE KIM HYUNSOO

250
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:52,548
But he was following your orders.

251
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:55,008
You should at least go to his funeral.

252
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,098
CAPTAIN OF DRUG INVESTIGATIONS UNIT
WI GIYONG

253
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,808
Officially, both my team and I

254
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,098
don't know that student.

255
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:08,058
Is that so?

256
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,528
All right, sir.

257
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:40,798
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

258

SCHOOL RECORDS
NAME: KIM TAK

259
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,908
STUDENT DORMITORY

260
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,188
Huh?

261
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:42,408
What do you mean by training?

262
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:45,488
You need to practice. It's only two weeks
until the sports festival.

263
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:48,038
I thought you were helping Hanna.

264
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:49,828
I was.

265
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,628
Then why are you helping me?
What about Hanna?

266
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,088
Well, Hanna...

267
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:01,178
-I'll help Gi Hanna with the training.
-What?

268
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,058
You can take care of Eunkang.

269
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,308
It seemed like she was
looking for a training partner.

270
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,518
Tak is helping her.

271
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:14,058
-Tak?
-Yes.

272
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:15,768
Let's go. We have a lot to do today.

273
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,728
Hey, wait.

274
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:21,238
Why? You don't want to do it with me?

275
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:26,698
No, that's not it...

276
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,538
All right. Let's go.

277
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,338
I'm already out here. So why not?

278
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:44,428
You want to ride this?

279
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,768
The first game of the triathlon is biking.

280
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:55,018
Consider it a lower-body exercise.
Let's go bike around this neighborhood.

281
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,738
I haven't ridden a bike in so long.
I'm not sure if I can ride it.

282
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:09,578
Gosh. This is really nice.

283
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,038
I had no idea there was a place like this
near our school.

284
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,998
We're not here to hang out.
This is a part of training.

285
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,788
-It's a long course, so take it slow.
-Okay.

286
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,508
Be careful.

287
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:33,848
All right. This is where
the uphill segment begins.

288
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,808
Take it slow.
Don't push yourself too hard.

289
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:38,228
Don't worry. This kind of thing
should be done at once.

290
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:39,568
Or you get tired soon.

291
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:42,108
I said, take it slow.

292
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:03,008
You're the weakest
and the least athletic freshmen.

293
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:04,628
You're in the bottom five percent.

294
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:08,008
By what standard, sir?

295
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:10,928
Based on your fitness scores
from the entrance exam.

296
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,688
You're supposed to be
excluded from the games,

297
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,228
but according to the regulations
of the sports festival,

298
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,268
all students must participate in
at least one game.

299
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,898
We won't have much time, but we,
seniors, will help you with training.

300
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:26,988
So bite the bullet and follow our lead.

301
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:28,238
Understood?

302
00:25:28,448 --> 00:25:29,658
Yes, sir.

303
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:30,868
Yoo Daeil. Seo Bumju.

304
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:31,988
Yes, sir.

305
00:25:32,078 --> 00:25:33,538
Choi Insik will be your trainer.

306
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:35,958
Follow me.

307
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:37,168
Shin Ari. Woo Juyoung.

308
00:25:37,248 --> 00:25:38,168
Yes, sir.

309
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:39,668
Baek Sunyu will be your trainer.

310
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,458
Okay. Follow me.

311
00:25:42,088 --> 00:25:44,008
And I'll take the remaining two.

312
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:44,918
Follow me.

313
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,218
Here.

314
00:25:53,258 --> 00:25:55,768
You're going to participate
in the Women's One-Leg Fight.

315
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:58,518
You need a strong lower body
and good balance to play this game.

316
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,268
So I want you to jump rope
1,000 times a day.

317
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:02,148
-One thousand...
-All right. Go.

318
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,948
Yes.

319
00:26:16,248 --> 00:26:17,158
Now?

320
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,618
Okay.

321
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:24,798
I need to go somewhere.
Keep practicing until I'm back.

322
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:27,258
Those have counters on them,
so no funny business.

323
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:28,298
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,298
Darn.

325
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,858
Well, this is surprising.

326
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,068
-What?
-You're not bad.

327
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:46,478
Did you take a private lesson?

328
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:48,318
-Yes.
-Really?

329
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:51,358
To get a good grade in gym class
when I was in elementary school.

330
00:26:51,448 --> 00:26:54,158
I also took rollerblading lessons
and kickball group lessons.

331
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,538
Looks like I still remember it
because I paid for it.

332
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:57,868
It's worth the money.

333
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,288
Those Gangnam kids spend money like water.

334
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,798
Hey. Is that Tak?

335
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,258
I guess Tak is helping Hanna
with the training.

336
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,718
I thought Seunghyun was helping her.
I guess they changed it.

337
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:41,788
You run better than I thought.

338
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:45,338
I guess having company helps.

339
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:47,958
Let's call it a day.

340
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,668
You should take it easy on the first day.

341
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:51,968
Here.

342
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:53,678
Okay. Thanks.

343
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:55,638
Wait.

344
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,768
Why did you switch with Seunghyun?

345
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:01,938
Oh. He's helping Eunkang.

346
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,728
-Ko Eunkang?
-Why? Are you upset that we switched?

347
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:10,608
No. I was just curious. See you tomorrow.

348
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:11,778
Okay.

349
00:29:19,138 --> 00:29:20,218
Here.

350
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,398
Hey.

351
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:34,988
Why is this uphill road so long?
Where does it end?

352
00:29:35,988 --> 00:29:37,358
I told you it's a long course.

353
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:38,948
And yet you would just speed up.

354
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,988
Well, I didn't know it'd be this long.

355
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:42,988
And when you take a difficult path,

356
00:29:43,078 --> 00:29:46,118
you should just push yourself and
get it over with. With a fighting spirit.

357
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,368
You shouldn't drag it out.
Then you'll get tired.

358
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,668
Hey, not everything is
about having spirit.

359
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,378
That's why you easily tire out.

360
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,628
If you don't know where your path ends,
you should pace yourself.

361
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:57,508
-Only then you can finish the course.
-Okay.

362
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,138
Anyway, good luck.

363
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:01,048
It's a downhill slope soon,
so hang in there.

364
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,178
I'm off.

365
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:03,718
Hey.

366
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:05,978
Hey, wait.

367
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:11,188
Hey! Wait up!

368
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,278
Oh, no. I can't slow down!

369
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:49,558
-Let's take a short break here.
-Okay.

370
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,648
-One second.
-My legs hurt.

371
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,608
-What is that?
-Wait.

372
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:03,528
-What are you doing?
-Sit.

373
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:10,998
I just did it since I had it.

374
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,248
Well, this is nice.

375
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,458
It is.

376
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:24,678
So, you do mountain biking
and shooting for fun.

377
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,768
You have many hobbies.
When did you have the time to study?

378
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:29,888
I'm not good at them, though.

379
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:31,768
I just tried them a bit.

380
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,978
Come on. You're just being modest.

381
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,278
I also had so many things
I wanted to do.

382
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,448
But only my sister got to go to academies.

383
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,988
Right. Are you an only child?

384
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,078
I have a big sister.

385
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:49,118
But she's been studying abroad
ever since she was little.

386
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:52,118
-So I grew up like an only child.
-Why didn't you go abroad?

387
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:54,248
Because my mom was lonely.

388
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:56,498
But she has your father.

389
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:59,548
My father is busy... all the time.

390
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,258
Ah...

391
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,548
My father is a police officer.

392
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:07,558
-Really?
-Yes.

393
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:08,468
Wow.

394
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:11,598
Is that why you came here?
To become like your father?

395
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:16,108
You must be really close to him.

396
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:22,528
When I was little,
my father once gave me a pat on the head.

397
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,658
He barely gives out compliments,

398
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:29,198
but when I said I'd like to be
a police officer like him,

399
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,408
he seemed so proud.

400
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:34,208
I think that's when...

401
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:37,918
I started to dream of
becoming a police officer.

402
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,838
Your father must be really happy then.

403
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,798
Since you'll be an officer
after graduating.

404
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:47,098
-I hope so.
-I'm sure he is.

405
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,468
Many parents want their children
to be civil servants.

406
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:51,888
Because they never get fired
and get a good pension.

407
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:54,388
My mom and dad also started
treating me differently

408
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:55,598
since I got into this school.

409
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:58,938
Before, they used to nag me all the time.

410
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,648
They called all their relatives
to brag about me.

411
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:04,988
I mean,
what are they going to do if I quit?

412
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:10,118
Don't quit.

413
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,498
Let's see through it to the end.

414
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:24,878
I'll think about it.

415
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:29,428
If I stay here until I graduate,

416
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:32,218
it would be because of
what you said today.

417
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:48,108
Jeez.

418
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:51,118
-I saw you practicing with Hanna.
-Yes, I'm training her.

419
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:54,658
So? How's it going?

420
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:57,538
Well, she's more athletic than I thought.

421
00:33:59,128 --> 00:34:00,078
Really?

422
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,248
Okay.

423
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,298
-Good luck.
-Okay. Good luck to you too.

424
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:10,848
I want to do it too.

425
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:13,888
-What?
-The training. I want you to train me too.

426
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,768
-But you're not on my team.
-So what? You don't want to do it?

427
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:19,478
No, I mean...

428
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,268
Shouldn't you practice
with people from your team?

429
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:23,318
No?

430
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:26,488
-Others will think it's strange and...
-Yes or no?

431
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:27,778
Tell me your answer.

432
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,618
I'm afraid that will be difficult.

433
00:34:31,158 --> 00:34:33,078
I won't have enough time
to help two people.

434
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:39,828
Okay.

435
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:49,968
<i>Sounds like she likes you.</i>

436
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,928
-No way. Why would she like me?
-Why would she be upset then?

437
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,598
I think she's jealous
because you're training another girl.

438
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:59,688
-Okay.
-Come on.

439
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:02,978
Yes!

440
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:07,608
-Stop cheating.
-I'm just that good.

441
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,398
-How was training? Was it all right?
-It was all right.

442
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,318
-What did you do?
-Biking.

443
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,448
You had a date.

444
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,788
It was training. It was tough.

445
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:19,998
Come on. We both know that's a lie.
I know you like Eunkang.

446
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,038
-No, I don't.
-Like hell, you don't.

447
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:23,958
You may fool others,
but you can't fool me.

448
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,248
I'm sensitive
and very astute about these things.

449
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:27,838
I get what's going on.

450
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,008
Keep it a secret.

451
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:32,258
Hey.

452
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,508
If you're so astute,
how could you not know Ari likes you?

453
00:35:35,598 --> 00:35:38,218
Well, because
there's no reason for her to like me.

454
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,558
She's so smart and pretty.

455
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,728
Hey. You should be more confident.
It's all about confidence.

456
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,938
-Mind your own business.
-What?

457
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,398
Be confident and ask her out.
Do you want me to call her out?

458
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:49,318
-Hey.
-Eunkang!

459
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,238
Hey!

460
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:51,318
You little!

461
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:52,698
-Eunkang!
-Ari!

462
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,158
Ari!

463
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:56,618
Ari... Ari!

464
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:57,658
Shin Ari!

465
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,868
Ari!

466
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,328
-Eunkang!
-Ari!

467
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,498
-You...
-Eunkang!

468
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:05,578
You...

469
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:08,338
-Eunkang!
-Ari!

470
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,628
Darn it. Are you okay?

471
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,088
-Shin Ari!
-Ko...

472
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,388
-Ko Eunkang!
-Shin Ari!

473
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:22,598
What are you doing?

474
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:25,978
Oh. Just some tonic for Seunghyun.
I packed some snacks too.

475
00:36:26,398 --> 00:36:28,978
You said you're having a special lecture
at his school tomorrow.

476
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:30,608
Please make sure to give this to him.

477
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,898
I'm not going there for fun.
I won't have time for that.

478
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:37,118
Come on. Just call him out for a second...

479
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,328
Or maybe I should go with you.

480
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:47,128
It's just...

481
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:50,418
I miss Seunghyun, that's all.

482
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,258
He hasn't come home for three weeks now,
and doesn't even call.

483
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:58,258
Gosh. I can't believe
this is how he repays his mother's love.

484
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:00,598
No news is good news.

485
00:37:01,598 --> 00:37:03,478
He's not coming
because he's enjoying school.

486
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:05,018
Do you think so?

487
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:08,478
What time is the special lecture tomorrow?

488
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:10,358
AUDITORIUM

489
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:11,978
<i>Everyone, stand up.</i>

490
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,488
Salute to the dean.

491
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,158
Salute!

492
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:21,328
Salute.

493
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:24,208
At ease.

494
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:27,708
At ease.

495
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,628
It seems like yesterday
when the new semester started,

496
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,338
but we're already halfway through.

497
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,098
Especially this year,
there had been many changes

498
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:41,808
inside and outside of school,

499
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:45,728
which probably confused some of you.

500
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:49,308
So today, we invited one of your seniors

501
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:53,898
who will give you valuable advice
on what you should prepare

502
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:56,778
as future police executives,
in this fast-changing world.

503
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,988
Let me proudly introduce your senior,

504
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,528
a KNPU graduate of Class 15,
Commissioner Wi Giyong

505
00:38:01,618 --> 00:38:03,448
of the East Gyeonggi Provincial
Police Agency.

506
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,158
Please welcome him
with a big round of applause.

507
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,218
Hello, my juniors.

508
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,888
Hello, sir!

509
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,678
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

510
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,428
As you'll probably experience yourself

511
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:28,518
when you actually start
working in the field,

512
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:31,438
one of the most frustrating things
that can happen to cops

513
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,068
is when arrest warrants are rejected
for no apparent reason.

514
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,398
While the arrest warrants
are rejected and requested again,

515
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:39,028
the criminals destroy the evidence,

516
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,238
and eventually,
the cops miss this golden hour.

517
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:45,488
According to Article 12,
Paragraph 3 of the Constitution,

518
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:51,038
only prosecutors have the authority
to request arrest warrants.

519
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:52,998
The police believe

520
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:56,958
that the prosecution's exclusive right
to request arrest warrants

521
00:38:57,048 --> 00:39:00,798
is one of the fundamental reasons
of corruption.

522
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:05,058
It's unfair that they have all the rights
to request arrest warrants.

523
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:14,358
That's about it.

524
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:15,608
Do you have any questions?

525
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:24,868
You.

526
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:29,458
I'm a KNPU freshman,
and my name is Wi Seunghyun.

527
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,368
I agree

528
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,588
that a lack of checks
on the power of prosecutors is a problem.

529
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:37,048
But if the reason
for the prosecution's corruption

530
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:38,758
is the right to request arrest warrants,

531
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:42,298
when the police are given the same right,
it can corrupt them too.

532
00:39:43,178 --> 00:39:45,758
How can we prevent
the corruption of police?

533
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,228
That should

534
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:57,438
not happen.

535
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:01,568
Which is why your role is important.

536
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:05,238
The controversy
between the prosecution

537
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:08,158
and the police over jurisdiction
may be seen as a power struggle.

538
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:11,498
At the end of the day, the structural
reform of the investigation system

539
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,918
can only be done by developing
competence for investigation.

540
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,798
In the near future, we'll have
the National Bureau of Investigation

541
00:40:17,878 --> 00:40:19,798
in Korea, just like the FBI in the US.

542
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:23,378
I want you to build
expertise in your field

543
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:26,388
and eventually grow
into a professional investigator

544
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:28,218
when the day comes.

545
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:49,198
Thank you so much for coming, sir.
I know how busy you are.

546
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:50,288
Don't mention it.

547
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:53,038
I haven't seen young students in a while.

548
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,538
Seeing them reminded me of my past.
It was nice.

549
00:40:57,378 --> 00:41:00,128
This is probably why you're in school.

550
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:04,168
Well, it is indeed nice
to be around young people,

551
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,678
but young people these days are not easy.

552
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:09,928
They don't blindly accept
what the school says.

553
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:13,518
They would even break into my office
if they have something to say.

554
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:17,268
Well, we had students like them too
when we were young.

555
00:41:17,938 --> 00:41:21,278
Kids around this age
are ignorant of the real world.

556
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,858
Which is why the school plays
a crucial role.

557
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:27,358
We need to tame these kids.

558
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,368
I'll do my best, sir.

559
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,328
Oh, no. I hope I didn't sound
like I was pressuring you.

560
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:43,258
Please think of it as a parent's concern.

561
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:44,838
Don't worry.

562
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:49,508
The billiards hall incident has been
smoothed over.

563
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:52,008
There won't be any more big trouble.

564
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:53,808
"The billiards hall incident"?

565
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:59,398
I'm sorry. I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to worry you.

566
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,148
It soon turned out
it was just a misunderstanding and...

567
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,438
I think you shouldn't
hang out with that boy called Kim Tak.

568
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,658
He was trying to protect me.

569
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:12,828
-He's a good friend.
-A good friend

570
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:14,748
doesn't put his friends in danger.

571
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:20,248
Cops who get involved with corruption
and resign weren't always bad people.

572
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:24,168
They resign because they can't
turn their backs on old friends,

573
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,798
because they feel sorry
and want to return favors.

574
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:31,218
A friend who cannot control his temper

575
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,598
will put you in trouble one day.

576
00:42:35,468 --> 00:42:38,768
Choose your friends wisely.

577
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,608
He's my friend.

578
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:46,528
I'll take care of it myself.

579
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,278
I'll go now.

580
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,668
We should've called
Seunghyun and Tak over too.

581
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:06,048
I would have too
if we had four drumsticks.

582
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:09,298
-We only have two.
-Then order one more chicken.

583
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,548
Jeez...

584
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,218
Hey.

585
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:15,678
This is not about money.

586
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,228
This is a quasi-state of war.

587
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:22,058
They're our enemies who we'll be
fighting against in the finals.

588
00:43:22,148 --> 00:43:23,938
We can't eat with our enemies.

589
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:28,278
Stay strong. Okay?

590
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:31,158
Don't even look at them
until the sports festival is over.

591
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:32,738
Just don't do anything. Okay?

592
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:34,618
Okay.

593
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,368
Did you see Wi Seunghyun

594
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,198
challenging his father
at the special lecture?

595
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:43,578
Looks like they don't get along.

596
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:45,288
Hey, they're putting on a show.

597
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:48,798
-He met his father after the lecture.
-What?

598
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:51,378
I saw him getting out
of the Commissioner's car.

599
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:53,798
Well, having such
a powerful father,

600
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:55,388
I'm sure he has nothing to fear.

601
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:56,508
Of course.

602
00:43:56,598 --> 00:43:58,518
-No way.
-Gosh.

603
00:43:58,598 --> 00:44:00,138
That's just ridiculous...

604
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:02,688
I mean, his name is Wi Seunghyun.

605
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,058
What was the Commissioner's name?

606
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:06,018
-Wi Giyong.
-Wi Gi...

607
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:13,108
Is it a special day today?

608
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:19,408
No, it's not.
I think of you whenever I eat good food.

609
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:23,578
Eat up.

610
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:26,668
You must be tired from
practicing for the sports festival.

611
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,508
Here.

612
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,678
-Thanks.
-Sure.

613
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:44,308
Though we have to be enemies
for the time being by a quirk of fate,

614
00:44:44,388 --> 00:44:45,478
we are actually one.

615
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,188
We're like brothers. No,

616
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:49,858
even real brothers aren't
as close as we are.

617
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,358
-Isn't that right?
-Yeah.

618
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,738
I see what's going on. Trying to bribe us.

619
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:57,448
-You'll ask us something weird again...
-Bribing? I'm...

620
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:02,328
I'm not bribing you. Stop talking
like that. You're hurting my feelings.

621
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,248
I even prepared this for us.

622
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:05,868
Look.

623
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,498
They're friendship rings.

624
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:11,798
-What?
-What?

625
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:13,588
-Grab him.
-Excuse me.

626
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:14,628
-What...
-Just a second.

627
00:45:14,718 --> 00:45:16,218
Hey, wait. No.

628
00:45:16,678 --> 00:45:18,178
We're more than just friends. Okay?

629
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:21,388
Let's always be good friends.
Let's be friends forever.

630
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,018
Here. Bumju.

631
00:45:25,018 --> 00:45:26,768
All right. This is for me.

632
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:27,858
Tak.

633
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,268
Have you lost your mind?

634
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:34,438
Let me put it on your finger.

635
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,948
Give me your finger.
Come on. Give me your finger.

636
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:40,328
Give me your finger!
Just give me your finger...

637
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:42,158
Hey!

638
00:45:42,538 --> 00:45:44,658
My finger!

639
00:45:44,748 --> 00:45:46,578
-Eat up.
-Put it on!

640
00:45:46,668 --> 00:45:49,038
Put it on your finger.

641
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:52,918
Well, that was hard.

642
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:57,378
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

643
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:34,128
Is this seat available?

644
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:36,378
Yes.

645
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:44,718
Oh, boy.

646
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,438
You're finally going home this week.

647
00:46:48,518 --> 00:46:51,148
-You always stayed at school.
-Right.

648
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:53,518
You haven't gone home
in a while either.

649
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:55,228
Your mom was worried you didn't call.

650
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:57,528
-Did you talk to my mom?
-Yes.

651
00:46:57,608 --> 00:47:00,238
She said I should come over
this evening to try the new menu.

652
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,818
She called you too?

653
00:47:02,908 --> 00:47:06,038
My gosh!
She's making a huge deal about it.

654
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:12,418
It's okay. I didn't have any plans anyway.

655
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:14,378
I haven't seen her in a while,
so it'd be nice.

656
00:47:15,088 --> 00:47:17,338
I can't believe her.

657
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,378
Hey.

658
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:00,258
-Hi.
-Have you eaten?

659
00:48:02,968 --> 00:48:04,008
I'm not hungry.

660
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:17,068
It's okay. I don't want to eat much.

661
00:48:17,148 --> 00:48:18,688
It's your first time back home.

662
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:20,988
I don't want you complaining
about no soup on the table.

663
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:22,528
Even if I did, you wouldn't listen.

664
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:25,368
Gosh.

665
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:30,078
Why do you have to put it like that?
That's heartless.

666
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,158
How rude.

667
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,918
Call Detective Kang.

668
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,798
I got into a fight with a customer
who wanted to pay later on a tab.

669
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:46,138
So I went to the police station,
and Detective Kang was there.

670
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:49,718
-Did you ask him for help again?
-He recognized me and came to me first.

671
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:53,638
Anyway, thanks to him, I got all the money
that the customer owed me.

672
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:54,728
Mom.

673
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:56,478
So hurry and graduate.

674
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,858
Once you become a cop,

675
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,978
I won't have to ask others for help.

676
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:06,908
Don't worry.
I can help her with those things.

677
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:09,408
Tell her to let me know
if she's in trouble again.

678
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,158
But I have to run your errands then.

679
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:14,998
You seem pretty angry.

680
00:49:17,578 --> 00:49:18,588
I understand.

681
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,588
You can't enjoy your college life
because of what I asked you.

682
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:23,468
I'm not there to have fun.

683
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:26,218
But I'm not there
to run your errands either.

684
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:27,838
I just...

685
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:33,098
want to live my own life.

686
00:49:33,678 --> 00:49:36,228
Hanna, once you learn
why I'm asking you this...

687
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:38,808
I'm not interested in why you're doing it.

688
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,228
I did it because I trusted you.
There's no other reason.

689
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:46,278
But I'm not sure
how long I'll be able to trust you.

690
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:49,158
Whenever I trust someone,

691
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,868
it never ends well.

692
00:50:39,878 --> 00:50:41,128
How much longer?

693
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,628
It's almost ready!

694
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,338
Okay.

695
00:50:45,588 --> 00:50:47,168
Here it comes.

696
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:50,588
Come on. Take one each.

697
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:52,758
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

698
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:55,138
-Thank you.
-Be careful. It's hot.

699
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,978
Thank you.

700
00:50:58,268 --> 00:51:01,558
How is it? It's a very special chicken.

701
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,018
The chicken was fed
organic blueberries only.

702
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:05,318
Do chickens eat that?

703
00:51:05,398 --> 00:51:07,148
They're omnivorous. They eat bananas too.

704
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:08,698
Right. Bananas.

705
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:11,868
I told the owner of the chicken farm
that he should feed them some bananas.

706
00:51:11,948 --> 00:51:15,118
Apparently, bananas are
really good for your immune system.

707
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:17,908
I don't think
it'll make much difference, though.

708
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:21,078
They're much better than those
that weren't fed bananas.

709
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:24,748
People these days are really sensitive
about their well-being and their food.

710
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:27,628
So tell me. Do the drumsticks
taste like blueberries?

711
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,878
It only tastes like oil.

712
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:34,098
But it's tasty and well-seasoned.
It's crispy too.

713
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,258
Then try this one.

714
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:39,348
It's sweet
and sour lemon chicken.

715
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:43,018
Dad, but doesn't this menu already exist?
I think I've seen it somewhere.

716
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:46,608
It's the sauce.
Our sauce tastes different.

717
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:50,108
We put a lot of lemons
in this sauce. So...

718
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:56,528
It doesn't taste greasy at all.

719
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,328
I'm not sure.

720
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,958
The batter feels a little different.
It's a little chewier.

721
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:05,248
-Because it's made with sticky rice.
-I see.

722
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:07,588
I think this will sell well.

723
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:09,838
It's a good alternative
for those who can't eat pork.

724
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,048
Do you think so?

725
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:12,508
Right?

726
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:15,388
Honey, we should listen to Juchan.

727
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:17,848
Juchan is a very prudent boy.
When he says something,

728
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:19,558
he says it for a reason.

729
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:21,688
-Okay.
-Okay.

730
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:24,478
So this is our new menu then.
It's decided!

731
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,358
-Decided.
-Decided!

732
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:29,358
Are we done? I'm off.

733
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,818
-Where are you going?
-Home.

734
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:34,278
Sit. Juchan is visiting us today.
And we haven't seen him in a while.

735
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:36,658
Juchan. Are you free?

736
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:37,868
Sure.

737
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:44,538
-Cheers! Cheers. Good.
-Cheers.

738
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:47,838
By the way, Juchan,
how come you are free this weekend?

739
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,378
You said you were busy.

740
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,588
Well, since I've become a senior,
I have more free time.

741
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,838
When you belong to a society,
the longer you stay in it,

742
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:54,928
the easier things get.

743
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,848
In schools, armies, and soccer clubs.

744
00:52:56,928 --> 00:52:58,848
Even in prisons, someone I knew...

745
00:52:58,928 --> 00:53:00,308
-Gosh.
-Okay. Forget this one.

746
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:03,178
You must have been really busy
if you had a girlfriend.

747
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,558
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Pardon?

748
00:53:05,648 --> 00:53:07,768
Mom, you're making him uncomfortable.

749
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:10,688
-He'll take care of it.
-Can't I even ask him a question?

750
00:53:11,028 --> 00:53:14,028
Well, if he doesn't have a girlfriend,

751
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:18,528
I wanted to set you up. Do you have one?

752
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:25,868
No. Not now.

753
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:27,878
"Not now"?

754
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,628
See? I told you.

755
00:53:30,048 --> 00:53:30,998
Really?

756
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:34,878
Then what do you think of girls
who are older than you?

757
00:53:35,628 --> 00:53:36,678
Older...

758
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,348
I haven't really thought about it.

759
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:40,138
Then think about it now.

760
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,558
-Now?
-Yes.

761
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,928
People these days say
that older girls are more understanding,

762
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:47,398
so they barely fight
with their boyfriends.

763
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:51,188
Well, since a police officer's job is
rather formal and conservative,

764
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:53,278
a frank and easy-going type of girl

765
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,778
-would be a great match for you.
-She's right.

766
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,408
-Don't you think?
-Mom. What are you doing now?

767
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:00,278
-What?
-Are you...

768
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:02,988
trying to set him up with me?

769
00:54:04,248 --> 00:54:05,288
What?

770
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:10,338
Mikang is two years older than him.

771
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:12,378
Stop it.

772
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:16,088
-Do you want us to be in a love triangle?
-"A love triangle"?

773
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:19,718
Eunkang has a crush on Juchan.
Didn't you know that?

774
00:54:20,138 --> 00:54:21,848
What are you talking about?

775
00:54:21,928 --> 00:54:23,348
What? You do.

776
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:25,518
You went to that college because of him.

777
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:30,938
Mom. When he was her tutor,
she even stole my makeup.

778
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:33,398
And the pass candy you got from Juchan.

779
00:54:33,818 --> 00:54:37,608
I only ate one,
and she pulled out a chunk of my hair!

780
00:54:37,698 --> 00:54:39,988
Mikang, that's a long time ago.

781
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,408
Now, I don't...

782
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:44,118
The same profession? That's even better!

783
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:46,328
It is!

784
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,958
He's right. How nice is that?

785
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:49,618
You can go and leave work together.

786
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:52,378
You'll be able to understand
each other better. You won't fight much.

787
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:54,048
Gosh! Eunkang!

788
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:56,708
How could you not tell us
anything about this?

789
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:57,968
That's not it.

790
00:54:59,428 --> 00:55:01,298
Seriously. It really isn't.

791
00:55:01,388 --> 00:55:03,558
-I'm sure she doesn't.
-"I'm sure she doesn't."

792
00:55:03,638 --> 00:55:04,678
Sure, let's say it's not.

793
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:06,178
Gosh!

794
00:55:06,978 --> 00:55:09,188
Since this came up anyway,
I hope you get along.

795
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:11,228
Seriously.
I really don't like him.

796
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,858
Yes, you do.
You even stole my clothes

797
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:14,518
the other day before meeting Juchan.

798
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:15,728
<i>The person
you have reached is...</i>

799
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:17,568
She's not answering.

800
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,028
Did she go to bed already?

801
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:27,908
-Hey.
<i>-Cheers!</i>

802
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:30,078
-<i>Cheers! Today is the farewell party.</i>
-Where are you?

803
00:55:30,168 --> 00:55:31,708
-Where is he?
-Another beer, please.

804
00:55:31,788 --> 00:55:32,788
Okay.

805
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:37,548
The seniors called me out.

806
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:43,548
Daeil, can't you see all your seniors
are looking for you?

807
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:45,348
I don't know. Hurry and come over.

808
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:48,138
Why would I go there?
It's Student Squad Two's party.

809
00:55:48,218 --> 00:55:49,848
No, it's not.

810
00:55:49,928 --> 00:55:51,848
-Thank you, Sunyu.
-Okay. So...

811
00:55:51,938 --> 00:55:52,808
Sir.

812
00:55:52,898 --> 00:55:54,518
I think this is
a farewell party for Sunyu.

813
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:55,858
"A farewell party"?

814
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:57,858
<i>Insik got drunk and told me.</i>

815
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,528
Sunyu is going to study abroad
after this semester.

816
00:56:00,778 --> 00:56:03,238
Is she taking a year off?
Why would they throw a farewell party?

817
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,448
No, she's not taking a year off.
She's going to study abroad.

818
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,368
Study...

819
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:09,078
She's quitting school!

820
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:10,788
Okay?

821
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,078
Yes!

822
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,248
I don't know. I heard
she broke up with her boyfriend too.

823
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:17,708
Well, it's her life.

824
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:20,048
Anyway, I don't want to go.

825
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:21,718
It's getting late too.

826
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:24,298
Don't drink too much. Okay.

827
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,308
So they broke up.

828
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,058
Okay, Eunkang. Good night.

829
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,688
It's dangerous at night,
so please walk her home safely.

830
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,108
-Mom, please.
-Don't worry.

831
00:56:38,188 --> 00:56:41,108
-I'm going home too.
-You'll wait.

832
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:42,738
Mom. Dad.

833
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:45,108
I really don't have a crush on him.

834
00:56:45,198 --> 00:56:46,868
There's nothing going on between us.

835
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:48,118
Fine! We get it.

836
00:56:48,198 --> 00:56:49,988
So go now. Go.

837
00:56:50,078 --> 00:56:51,788
Come on. Go.

838
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:54,668
-Gosh.
-All right. Let's get back inside.

839
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,338
Gosh. This is just unbelievable.

840
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:00,458
What's wrong with them?

841
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,548
STOP

842
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,338
Juchan, why did you lie?

843
00:57:05,428 --> 00:57:07,888
They're like that because you said
you didn't have a girlfriend.

844
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,268
Whatever. I'm going to just tell them.

845
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:14,308
I really don't have a girlfriend.

846
00:57:15,518 --> 00:57:16,648
We broke up.

847
00:57:17,978 --> 00:57:19,148
Sunyu and I.

848
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:34,658
INCOMING TRAIN

849
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:44,508
She wants to study fashion.

850
00:57:45,878 --> 00:57:48,428
I knew she thought about it a lot,
so I couldn't stop her.

851
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:53,808
I thought being a cop really suited her.

852
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:04,488
It's a full moon.

853
00:58:06,898 --> 00:58:08,238
Juchan, you know what?

854
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:13,198
You know how people make wishes
when they see a full moon.

855
00:58:14,288 --> 00:58:17,748
But you're not supposed to wish
for something you want.

856
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:21,878
You're supposed to wish

857
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:24,298
for something you want to be gone.

858
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:26,878
Is that so?

859
00:58:27,298 --> 00:58:31,548
Try wishing for
all the sad and negative feelings

860
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,388
inside of you to be gone.

861
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:36,388
It'll make you feel much better.

862
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:44,898
Gosh. The little freckled girl
has all grown up.

863
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:48,608
-Look at you, comforting me now.
-I'm all grown up. I'm 20 years old.

864
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:55,868
It's a cat.

865
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:59,248
It's a cute cat.

866
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,038
Juchan, let me give you a question.

867
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:06,128
What does a cat say

868
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:09,258
when you say "meow" to it?

869
00:59:12,428 --> 00:59:15,058
"Why-meow?"

870
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:17,308
That's not fair.

871
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,268
You should've said it's a trick question.

872
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,148
