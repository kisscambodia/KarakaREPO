1
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:08,138
What's the blood type of most cops?

2
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,258
Blood type?

3
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:13,638
Take your time. I'm going to the restroom.

4
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:14,808
Okay.

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:22,988
I've read that somewhere...

6
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:24,858
Was it A?

7
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,868
WI SEUNGHYUN

8
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:33,328
Blood type...

9
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:40,088
WI SEUNGHYUN

10
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:52,888
Hello?

11
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:54,928
<i>Hey, Seunghyun.</i>

12
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:58,558
Is that you, Juchan?

13
00:00:58,648 --> 00:00:59,648
Yes.

14
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:01,518
Eunkang went to the restroom.

15
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:02,608
Where are you?

16
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:04,238
Are you together now?

17
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:08,238
Never mind.

18
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,328
I'll call her later.

19
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:11,868
Bye.

20
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,888
The most common blood type of cops is...

21
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:35,888
<i>B-woo, B-woo.</i>

22
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:37,978
What's that?

23
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,768
What? It's type B.

24
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:41,518
<i>B-woo, B-woo.</i>

25
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:44,358
You little punk.

26
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,488
What? You're just upset
that you didn't get the answer.

27
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:49,858
-Hey, you got a bump.
-Really?

28
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:53,328
-Just kidding.
-Gosh, you're so immature.

29
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:55,078
Seriously.

30
00:01:58,748 --> 00:01:59,958
Go on in.

31
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,208
Okay.

32
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,468
Juchan.

33
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,798
Chin up. You'll get through this.

34
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:13,258
When things get too hard, call me.

35
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,808
I can buy you a drink.

36
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:17,558
-You're being cheeky.
-What? I'm a grown-up now.

37
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,848
-I'm old enough to drink now.
-Just go home.

38
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:20,898
Okay.

39
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,068
-Good night.
-Bye.

40
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:04,018
EPISODE 8

41
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,528
Hurry up.

42
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:37,428
Gosh!

43
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,268
Slow down. You might upset your stomach.

44
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:56,738
The food tastes amazing.

45
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,908
I feel like I'm in an Olympic Village
these days.

46
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:02,828
I wake up so early in the morning
and all I do is to eat, sleep, and run.

47
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,618
But it made you much stronger now.

48
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,288
At first, you could barely
make half the course.

49
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:08,458
At this rate, I'm going to be the winner.

50
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,418
Just focus on finishing the course.
That's your goal.

51
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:12,128
You don't know anything about me.

52
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:16,138
I got the best score
on the physical fitness test at my school.

53
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:17,638
Really?

54
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,888
I ran 1,000 meters in
4 minutes and 50 seconds.

55
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,728
I did 35 push-ups
and my grasping power measured 35.

56
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,108
I may not look it,
but I'm actually quite strong.

57
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:38,318
Okay. Then let's get right to it.

58
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:40,698
Forty...

59
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:42,698
...nine.

60
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,498
Fifty...

61
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,258
Gosh.

62
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,428
You said you did 60 sit-ups
on the test. Was it a lie?

63
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:57,968
That was last year.

64
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,388
I'm a year older now. It's so hard.

65
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,518
One more sit-up. Then we call it a day.

66
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,728
-Really?
-Yes.

67
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,408
What was that?

68
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:21,828
I was almost there. You messed it up.

69
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:24,198
You're just making an excuse.
I just laid one finger on you.

70
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,908
Haven't you heard
of the expression,

71
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:28,958
"The straw that broke the camel's back"?

72
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,788
Apparently, she's still got some energy
to joke around.

73
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,378
Make sure to be hard on her.

74
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,128
Don't let her fool you
if she pretends to be sick.

75
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:38,888
What? Oh, okay.

76
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,888
-What are you doing this evening?
-What?

77
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:43,308
You said you'd buy me a drink.

78
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:46,598
Right. I'm free after classes.
I'll call you.

79
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,898
Okay. Keep it up then.

80
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,858
Gosh. My whole body aches.

81
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,898
-Keep going.
-Let's take a short break.

82
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:57,148
-Come on. Ten more sit-ups.
-Are we done after ten more?

83
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:58,778
Just do it.

84
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,868
When he was my tutor,

85
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:05,038
I once faked being sick
because I didn't want to do homework.

86
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:07,038
I hate math so much.

87
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:10,668
Don't tell the others
that Juchan was my tutor.

88
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:11,748
Okay.

89
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,878
Where should we go?

90
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,918
There are too many students
near the school.

91
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:20,508
Do you know any quiet place
where we can talk over a drink?

92
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,048
Not really.

93
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,388
Are you talking about something serious?

94
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:25,928
Well...

95
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:29,268
It's just that
Juchan is having a hard time these days.

96
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,728
-Then maybe I should come too.
-What?

97
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:35,398
I'm free this evening too.

98
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:37,738
The more the merrier.

99
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:38,858
Ahh...

100
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,328
No. Not today.

101
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,488
Let's hang out together
another time. Okay?

102
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:47,748
-Okay.
-See you.

103
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:48,788
Bye.

104
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,668
-Hey, Seunghyun.
-Yes?

105
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,498
-I saw you applied for the Cheering Squad.
-What?

106
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,128
Good luck. I'm looking forward to it.

107
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:02,798
Cheering?

108
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:04,678
I signed us up.

109
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,638
The highlight of Cheongram Sports
Festival is the freshmen's talent show.

110
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,888
Who else would do it besides us,
the handsome Freshmen Four?

111
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:12,848
What are you saying? Who said that?

112
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:14,108
Well, obviously, I say...

113
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,488
And I know we all agree with me.

114
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,948
Your mind, my mind. My mind, your mind.

115
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,028
In the end, we are all of the same mind.

116
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,868
Whatever. Good luck with that.
I'm out of this.

117
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:30,708
You can't be out. You're the center.

118
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,628
The name of our team is...

119
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,418
Wivengers.

120
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,498
Wow. You finally lost your mind.

121
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:39,958
You know what?

122
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:43,088
I've always thought of you
as our leader ever since we first met.

123
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,848
Having you in the center
makes me feel safe.

124
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,178
-Why am I...
-Don't ask why.

125
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:49,638
It's just because...

126
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,928
you're my favorite.

127
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,978
You're acting weird these days.

128
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,768
Does Seunghyun have something on you?

129
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,858
-Why are you sucking up to him?
-You little...

130
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:03,318
Hey. Seunghyun is not that kind of guy.

131
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:06,238
How could you not know how great he is?
You're even his roommate.

132
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,658
Gosh. You're upsetting me.

133
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:09,328
You're not mad, are you?

134
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:10,948
Anyway, I can't do the talent show.

135
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,788
Let's do it.

136
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:18,788
I want to try it.

137
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:20,958
It'll be a good memory too.

138
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:27,508
If you really don't feel like it,
we don't have to.

139
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,138
Okay. Let's do it.

140
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,688
Come on. Bumju wants to do it.
Let's do it.

141
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,268
Yes!

142
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,898
Okay.

143
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:45,108
I actually found some videos
that might help us.

144
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:46,108
You did?

145
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,738
EAST GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

146
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:55,408
Here's the information
about Seunghyun's roommate you asked for.

147
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:56,578
Thanks.

148
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,708

PERSONAL INFORMATION
NAME: KIM TAK

150
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:02,128
His parents ran a small business
before dying in a car accident,

151
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,378
and his brother died ten years ago.
He was a KNPU student.

152
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,548
My name is Kim Hyunsoo
and I'm a 4th-year law student at KNPU.

153
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:12,518
I'm Kim Hyunsoo.

154
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,648
Should I do more research?

155
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:28,568
No, it's okay. You can go now.

156
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:38,918
HIS BROTHER KIM HYUNSOO DIED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT WHILE ATTENDING KNPU

157
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:40,878
Did you bring your wallet?

158
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:42,628
Hello.

159
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,088
-Hi, Ari.
-Goodness.

160
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,098
Hi.

161
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,018
Hey. You want the one with red bean?

162
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:02,108
It's sold out.

163
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,548
Why would he give me the strawberries?

164
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,338
Is he playing hard to get or what?

165
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:32,218
-Who's playing hard to get?
-What?

166
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:35,428
-No one.
-Hey, it's melting.

167
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:39,558
Darn it.

168
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,268
Gosh!

169
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,528
Why does he even like this?

170
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,438
Then give it to me. I love it.

171
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:52,488
Come on. Who is it?
Who is this boy tantalizing you?

172
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,988
He's not tantalizing anyone.
I'm not interested in him at all.

173
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:59,078
If anyone, he'd be the one
being tantalized, not me.

174
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,958
Tsss... So there is a guy.

175
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:02,288
I don't know!

176
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,128
He's not my type anyway.

177
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,168
I hate corny country boys like him.

178
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:09,168
Like I'd care
if he has a crush on me.

179
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:26,688
<i>What are you doing this evening?</i>

180
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,858
<i>I'm free after classes.
I'll call you.</i>

181
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,118
Cheers!

182
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:04,098
THE CAFE IS OPEN
TAKEOUT AVAILABLE

183
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,518
RESTAURANT ENTRANCE

184
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:18,328
It's cut like a pizza.

185
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:21,038
Right. Pizzas like this are really good.

186
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,198
Right. But I haven't really tried.

187
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:23,538
-You haven't?
-No. Not so many times.

188
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,828
Oh.

189
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,038
-Hey.
-I didn't know you were here.

190
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,208
-Hello.
-Hey.

191
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:31,758
What are you doing here?

192
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,298
-I came to grab a drink.
-Alone?

193
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:37,508
I love drinking alone. Well...

194
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:40,098
I just came across this bar.
It seems nice, so I came in.

195
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,058
What a funny coincidence.

196
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:44,438
Actually, Seunghyun,
why don't you join us?

197
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:45,938
Is that okay with you?

198
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,148
I hope I'm not bothering you.

199
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,148
Could we have another glass, please?

200
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:57,358
Cheers.

201
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,078
Help yourself. It's my treat.

202
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:09,288
-No, it's on me.
-There you go, being cheeky again.

203
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,748
I said I was going to pay today.

204
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,588
You always paid for me.

205
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,298
-I'm not that shameless.
-You can be shameless.

206
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,258
That's an unusual color for a wallet.
It really stands out.

207
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,808
Really? Eunkang got it for me.

208
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,728
I gave it to him for his birthday
when I was a high school freshman.

209
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,398
But Juchan,
I think you should get a new one.

210
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:31,608
It seems all worn out.

211
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:33,318
It looks fine to me.
I can use it for at least ten more years.

212
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:36,198
It's not even real leather.

213
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:39,408
I couldn't get you a good one
because I didn't have money then.

214
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,868
But I really like this wallet.

215
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,788
To be honest, I lost it twice.

216
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,868
But it always found its way back to me.

217
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:49,998
-Really?
-Yeah.

218
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,338
-I must be destined to keep it.
-How interesting.

219
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:55,168
-Right?
-You must not have had much cash in it.

220
00:13:56,798 --> 00:14:00,138
-I guess so.
-I think that's probably why.

221
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:02,808
If there was,
it wouldn't have been returned.

222
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:04,518
Maybe you're right.

223
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,018
I'm going to use the restroom.

224
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,108
-Let's drink.
-Okay.

225
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,748
-Eunkang is a fine girl, isn't she?
-Pardon?

226
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:35,748
Right.

227
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,758
She may look stubborn, fussy, and fiesty,

228
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,008
but inside, she has a soft heart.
She's also very caring.

229
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:45,058
I know.

230
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:47,888
Please take good care of her.

231
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:51,098
-You're her colleague, so be nice to her.
-Okay.

232
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:53,688
That's a weird thing to ask though.

233
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:56,148
It's not like she's your girlfriend.

234
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:10,748
I've known her since she was little,

235
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:13,328
so she has always been
like a little sister to me.

236
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:15,788
But seeing her at school now,
it feels different.

237
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,208
These days, I even find myself
relying on her when things get tough.

238
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,928
It's natural that you feel comfortable

239
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:25,798
around the person you're familiar with
during hard times.

240
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,698
-I have to get this.
-Sure.

241
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:00,918
RESTROOM

242
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:03,838
Eunkang.

243
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:05,928
Can we talk for a moment?

244
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,778
It looks like
Seunghyun came because of you.

245
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:33,958
I'm sorry.
I wanted to make you feel better today.

246
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,958
I think he likes you.

247
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,088
What?

248
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:43,008
Oh, no.
There's nothing going on between us.

249
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,338
It's not like he confessed to me.

250
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,428
Then can I say it first?

251
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,188
You once said you liked me.

252
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,608
Do you still feel the same?

253
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:11,578
I...

254
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:14,998
like...

255
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,288
you too.

256
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:30,428
But I like you as a senior.

257
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:34,928
I like someone else now.

258
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,108
I see.

259
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,748
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable...</i>

260
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,878
Where did he go? Why won't he pick up?

261
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,908
47TH CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL

262
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:37,078
Athletes' oath.

263
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,708
Athletes' oath!

264
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:43,038
We promise to take part
in the 47th Cheongram Sports Festival,

265
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:45,498
respecting and abiding by the rules
that govern them,

266
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:50,088
and in the true spirit of sportsmanship,
for the glory of sport

267
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:51,638
and the honor of KNPU.

268
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:53,298
Order arms.

269
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,428
UNITE AS ONE CHEONGRAM FAMILY WITH PASSION
47TH CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL

270
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,768
BE A WARNING TO THE PEOPLE

271
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,688
Today is finally the day
of the Cheongram Sports Festival,

272
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,768
which you've been looking forward to.

273
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:08,028
I know how hard you've worked
for the midterms.

274
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:12,948
Today, I hope you can make the most of
all the strength you've been building up,

275
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,028
showing us your youth and passion.

276
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,078
But what's most important is

277
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,328
that we don't have any injuries.

278
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,418
I hope we can all sweat
and compete safely,

279
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:26,088
and that this event
will bring us all together.

280
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:30,168
Now, let's begin
the 47th Cheongram Sports Festival.

281
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,278
BLUE FLAME OF STUDENT SQUAD 1
STUDENT SQUAD 2 IS THE ONLY WINNER!

282

00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:14,258

STUDENT SQUAD 2 WINS

290
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:31,338
Professor Bang.
Let's drop rank during the game, okay?

291
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:33,708
Don't be easy on me
just because I'm the dean.

292
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:35,258
But how can I...

293
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:36,758
All right, then.

294
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,798
-Fair play!
-Ready.

295
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,298
Let's do this!

296
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,648
Pull!

297
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:52,188
Pull!

298
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:54,028
Guys! Pull!

299
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,568
Pull!

300
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:02,868
One!

301
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:08,038
One! Lie down!

302
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,168
Just lie down!

303
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:13,548
Pull it!

304
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,008
Lie down!

305
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:17,918
Just lie down!

306
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:23,718
RELAY RACE

307
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:33,728
Ready.

308
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,108
UM HYUK IS WATCHING YOU!

309
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:42,028
STUDENT SQUAD 1 IS THE CHAMPION!

310
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,868
CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL SCOREBOARD

311
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:09,678
STUDENT SQUAD 1 IS THE CHAMPION!

312
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:10,768
JUCHAN WILL LEAD US TO VICTORY!

313
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:46,098
Hurry!

314
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:48,098
-You're almost there!
-Come on.

315
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:49,558
Hurry!

316

318
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:45,218
STUDENT SQUAD 2 LOSES

319
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:06,528
Hey, Daeil, are you all right?

320
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:13,238
It can happen to anyone.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

321
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:26,418
Help yourself, Professor Bang.

322
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,258
You worked hard today.

323
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,718
He's right. Eat up, Professor Bang.

324
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:35,008
Professor Bang.
I've discovered a new side of you today.

325
00:26:35,848 --> 00:26:38,808
If Student Squad Two wins this year,

326
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,148
you should be the MVP.

327
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:43,768
Come on. You're just being humble.

328
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:46,278
She was really famous
even back when she was a student here.

329
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,488
Do you know what she was called?

330
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,778
-Ms. Loud Voice.
-What?

331
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:53,238
Because her voice was so loud,
she was called Ms. Loud Voice.

332
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:56,078
She was infamous.

333
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:00,918
It's tasty.

334
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:03,418
Well, you can call it
a skill too.

335
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:06,418
I mean, they say
even the ancient Roman soldiers

336
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,418
shouted in the battlefield
to sap the morale of their enemies.

337
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,388
By the way, you know what?

338
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,518
I still can't believe...

339
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,478
that you two were in the same class here.

340
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,058
I studied law for two years before
coming here, making me two years older.

341
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:26,728
Still, it's hard to believe.

342
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:30,198
Hearing that you were colleagues
surprises me every time.

343
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,568
Is it that hard to believe?

344
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:34,988
Professor Cha.

345
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:37,658
She's saying you look old. Okay?

346
00:27:39,578 --> 00:27:40,498
Ahh...

347
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,298
KNPU

348
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:51,048
-We've got to really get it together.
-Just you, man.

349
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,638
That's why
you should be good at running.

350
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:55,968
But still...

351
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:58,968
Women's triathlon
will decide everything.

352
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:02,938
As expected,
it's a battle between Squads One and Two.

353
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:05,938
We're winning for now,
but we've got to be careful.

354
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,108
There's only a five-point difference.

355
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:10,858
The games in the afternoon
will decide the victor.

356
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,028
TOTAL SCORE, CURRENT RANKINGS

357
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,748
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

358
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:22,328
Got it?

359
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:25,038
STUDENT SQUAD 1'S INTELLIGENCE AND PASSION
WILL LEAD TO VICTORY!

360
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:28,628
What's wrong with your foot?

361
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,798
Oh, hey. I just hurt it a bit.

362
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,508
-Are you okay?
-I can still run. Don't worry.

363
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:36,678
Why didn't you tell me?

364
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,718
You should have told me
even if it's a small injury.

365
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:40,808
I didn't have the chance.

366
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:43,348
You even told me
to practice alone yesterday.

367
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,808
Sorry. Our team had a meeting that day.

368
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:51,148
What kind of meeting takes the whole day?

369
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:57,778
Tell me. Are you mad at me?

370
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:01,368
You left the bar without telling me,
and you didn't answer my calls.

371
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:05,958
No. I went home that night
because I wasn't feeling well.

372
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:11,418
<i>All triathlon participants,
please prepare for the game now.</i>

373
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:14,168
All trench fight participants
may also wait in the arena.

374
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:15,718
Let's get going.

375
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:19,178
You've been training hard,
so I'm sure you'll do a good job.

376
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,808
Take it easy though.

377
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:22,768
-Your goal is to finish the course.
-Okay.

378
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,268
Good luck to you too. Don't hurt yourself.

379
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,558
Thanks.

380
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,448
Seunghyun.

381
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:43,908
There's something I want to tell you
after the game.

382
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:46,118
What is it?

383
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,538
I'll tell you after I win. See you later.

384
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:57,758
Don't hurt yourself.

385
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:00,088
Good luck.

386
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:07,848
If you get injured or don't feel well,

387
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:09,648
wave the handkerchief immediately.

388
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,488
On your marks!

389
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:34,588
TRIATHLON

390
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,268
Trench fight is all about strength.

391
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:49,518
We're going to make use
of our physical advantage to the utmost.

392
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,398
Let me pair you up
with each of their players.

393
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,438
Make sure to mark them thoroughly.

394
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,108
Who's marking Kim Tak? It won't be easy.

395
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,358
Right, he's strong.

396
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,488
-Hey, Juchan is...
-It'll be tough even for Juchan.

397
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,198
-Kim Tak?
-We'll have him marked...

398
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,238
by you.

399
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:04,238
Pardon?

400
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:16,128
You need to push the entire
opposing team out of the trench to win.

401
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:18,758
Take one step out of the trench,

402
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:21,088
and you're out. Understood?

403
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,638
Yes, sir!

404
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:23,848
Captains.

405
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:25,348
Shake hands.

406
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:36,108
Let's go.

407
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,488
All right.

408
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,658
Let's do this!

409
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,738
-Okay!
-Let's do this!

410
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,908
Go for it!

411
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:55,748
Let's go!

412
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,218
LET'S GET 1ST PLACE

413
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:30,788
You're out!

414
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:42,668
Out!

415
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:51,848
Out!

416
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,038
This is the final lap.

417
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:10,178
If Tak is our last man standing,
we'll win hands down.

418
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:13,348
Our goal is to cover him
and make it a one-on-one match.

419
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,308
Squad One will try
to make Tak their last man standing.

420
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,598
We will sacrifice a player
to remove him before that.

421
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,168
Out!

422
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,638
But what if Tak gets pushed out first?

423
00:35:00,018 --> 00:35:01,228
When that happens...

424
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:06,648
I'll stall for time then.

425
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,578
Lift him up.

426
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:20,788
Come on.

427
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,168
Juchan! Look at Seunghyun! Look at him!

428
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,558
Come on! Juchan!

429
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:01,538
Squad Two, out!

430
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,628
If you'd come a little later,
the whole plan would have failed.

431
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,128
But I didn't. Gosh. This is killing me.

432
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:21,388
Student Squad One wins!

433
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:35,948
STUDENT SQUAD 1 WINS

434
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,348
Come on. Stand up.

435
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:01,098
-We've got to win.
-I'm so sorry. Go ahead.

436
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,018
-Sorry.
-See you soon.

437
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:08,228
Kim Semi of Student Squad Two forfeits.

438
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:28,128
This is the halfway point!

439
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,788
-Okay!
-Okay!

440
00:37:29,878 --> 00:37:32,128
-You can do it!
-You're doing great!

441
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:42,258
Ko Eunkang! Ko Eunkang!
Ko Eunkang! Ko Eunkang!

442
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:48,978
Yes! Yes!

443
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,058
She might make a comeback.

444
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:54,028
Baek Sunyu!
Baek Sunyu! Baek Sunyu!

445
00:37:58,448 --> 00:38:01,408
Pace yourself. Take it slow.

446
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,508
47TH CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL
COURSE 2

447
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:24,848
Go! Go! Go!

448
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:25,928
It's raining!

449
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:50,498
I think it fell
because of the rain.

450
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,828
I don't think I can fix it.

451
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:53,998
That's a shame.

452
00:38:54,088 --> 00:38:56,338
I guess we should use the radio
to see how it's going.

453
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,588
How strange though. The forecast
didn't say it was going to rain.

454
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:02,008
I know. I think it'll stop soon though.

455
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:04,008
Why does it have to rain now?

456
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:11,268
It hurts.

457
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:53,438
All right!
This is the halfway point!

458
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:54,938
You got this!

459
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:03,738
COURSE 2 HALFWAY POINT

460
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,698
Thank you.

461
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,328
-You can do it!
-Go for it!

462
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:08,738
The last contestant
has just passed the halfway point.

463
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:14,118
47TH CHEONGRAM SPORTS FESTIVAL
COURSE 2

464
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:29,768
Hey. Hanna.

465
00:40:30,348 --> 00:40:31,558
Thank goodness.

466
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,848
I knew I wasn't supposed to die here.

467
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:35,898
Please help me. I can't walk.

468
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:37,858
Just forfeit.

469
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,188
The staff is coming soon, so tell them.

470
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:41,148
What?

471
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:44,108
Hey, you can't just leave. Help me.

472
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:47,028
Why should I help you?

473
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,698
Because we're on the same team.

474
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:53,288
You never shoot friendly fire during a war
no matter how much you hate them.

475
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:59,128
If this is a war, it's a great chance
to shoot your teammate quietly.

476

COURSE DIRECTION

477
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:03,758
Hey.

478
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:07,138
Hey! Why do you hate me?

479
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:09,388
What is it that I did so wrong?

480
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,928
Telling the Training Corps
that the spy cam belonged to you?

481
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:13,678
I did that because you framed me for it.

482
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:15,348
Don't you remember
what you did to me first?

483
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:16,848
Do you even have a conscience?

484
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:19,058
I told you I didn't mean to
frame you for it.

485
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:21,438
And I said it was an accident.

486
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:24,988
Anyway, if you hadn't brought
the charger to the Training Corps,

487
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:27,318
things wouldn't have become
so complicated.

488
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:29,618
Then you acted
like you worried about me.

489
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:31,578
Seriously.

490
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,998
So stop being such a hypocrite.

491
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,078
Hypo...

492
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:37,168
I'm not being a hypocrite

493
00:41:37,248 --> 00:41:39,338
and I wasn't necessarily
worrying about you either.

494
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:41,798
Why would I care about you?
I've got my own problems to deal with.

495
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:45,668
I brought it into question
because I thought it was unfair.

496
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,928
But fine. I get you're mad.

497
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:51,348
But thanks to what you filmed
with the spy cam,

498
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:54,308
Cheongram Education got abolished.
That's all that matters, isn't it?

499
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:57,978
You filmed it to let others know
how absurd the punishment system was.

500
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:59,648
And you achieved your goal.

501
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:03,858
Technically, we abolished
Cheongram Education together.

502
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,438
So you should be happy about it.

503
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,578
Now I get why I hate you.

504
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:17,618
Being with you
makes me look like a horrible person.

505
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,208
That's why I hate you. Happy now?

506
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,688
<i>The leading group
is passing the main gate.</i>

507
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,188
They're coming.

508
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:46,568
She's here!

509
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,948
Baek Sunyu!

510
00:43:21,898 --> 00:43:22,768
Get up.

511
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:31,318
With this, everything's settled
between you and me.

512
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,448
This is for saving me from being expelled.

513
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:37,748
Wait.

514
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,288
COURSE DIRECTION

515
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:51,468
STUDENT SQUAD 2 WINS

516
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,188
What happened to them?

517
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:07,188
I don't know about Hanna,

518
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:09,278
but Eunkang was in the lead
until the halfway point.

519
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,398
Maybe she tripped somewhere.

520
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:19,448
-What's wrong with your foot?
-I just hurt it a bit.

521
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,668
Hey! Where are you going?

522
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:34,128
It's great you decided
to take responsibility for your actions.

523
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:35,468
I'll gladly accept your offer.

524
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:39,098
So we're all good now.
Do you know what that means?

525
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,678
We start all over again.
Back to square one.

526
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:42,848
Gosh!

527
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:44,648
Be quiet, will you?

528
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:46,228
I'm tired.

529
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,648
Could you slow down a little?
It really hurts.

530
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:55,108
We can't win anyway.
No one's waiting for us.

531
00:45:06,168 --> 00:45:07,328
Hey, Misook.

532
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:09,918
Well done.

533
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,128
Everyone came back
except Eunkang and Hanna.

534
00:45:16,218 --> 00:45:18,098
Maybe something bad
happened to them.

535
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:19,428
Okay.

536
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,138
It seems the radio isn't working
in the mountains right now.

537
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:24,938
The staff don't know
what's going on either.

538
00:45:26,728 --> 00:45:28,688
I'll go check out the mountain.

539
00:45:30,568 --> 00:45:31,528
Hey.

540
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:33,488
There they are.

541
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,118
I'll walk myself. Just hold me.

542
00:45:43,788 --> 00:45:46,618
It's okay. That'll take forever.

543
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,878
Guys!

544
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:54,668
Eunkang.

545
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:58,888
-What happened? Did you get hurt?
-Yes.

546
00:45:58,968 --> 00:46:02,598
You should have taken your phone
with you in case of emergency.

547
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,098
-We need to call the ambulance.
-It's okay.

548
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:07,138
I want to finish the race.

549
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:10,898
I know I can't win,

550
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,898
but I want to finish it.

551
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:17,148
Hanna, let's go.

552
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,198
Hey. Give it.

553
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:27,658
Shouldn't we be stopping them?

554
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:29,288
-Are you sure?
-My gosh.

555
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:30,748
-That must hurt.
-Really.

556
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:32,998
I think she's bleeding.

557
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,718
-You're almost there! Keep going!
-You can do it!

558
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,138
Are you okay?

559
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:26,058
-Yes. Water...
-Ari, get her some water.

560
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:39,068
I'm sorry. I wanted to win.

561
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:41,318
You're being cheeky again.

562
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,168
Well done.

563
00:48:01,428 --> 00:48:04,678
You finished the race
and didn't abandon your friend.

564
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,358
STUDENT SQUAD 1 IS THE CHAMPION!

565
00:48:22,738 --> 00:48:23,608
Hanna.

566
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,328
Thank you.

567
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:30,158
I wouldn't have made it to the end
without you.

568
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:37,538
Let's start from square one again.

569
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:11,538
Well done.

570
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:12,948
Well done.

571
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:15,288
You were pretty cool back there.

572
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:16,878
You did a good job.

573
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,378
<i>If someone asks me
why I like Eunkang,</i>

574
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:24,668
<i>my answer would be</i>

575
00:49:25,678 --> 00:49:28,348
<i>because she never gives up on people.</i>

576
00:49:30,138 --> 00:49:31,058
All right.

577
00:49:32,388 --> 00:49:34,848
Come on, Tak. Get closer.

578
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:37,268
-Come on. Come closer.
-Hurry.

579
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:40,188
All right. Here we go.
This is our first group photo.

580
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,268
Okay? Let's get this done at once.

581
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,688
Do we have to take a photo
when we're all sweaty though?

582
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:45,318
I look a bit messy now.

583
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:47,608
You're the prettiest here. Actually,
I've never seen you this pretty...

584
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:48,778
-Really?
-No.

585
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:51,618
-One, two, three.
-Three.

586
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,908
-Should we take another one?
-Let's take another one.

587
00:49:54,998 --> 00:49:56,328
Okay. Smile.

588
00:49:56,408 --> 00:49:57,998
One, two, three.

589
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:07,428
All right. That was
just the beginning of the show.

590
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:10,138
The next team has
such an extraordinary name.

591
00:50:10,218 --> 00:50:12,508
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a big round of applause

592
00:50:12,598 --> 00:50:16,308
to Gentlemen Always Pay for Dinner!

593
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:43,798
The senior students'
dance party!

594
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,518
My gosh.
Our seniors are so hot.

595
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:26,048
Are you nervous?

596
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:27,628
I'm sure you haven't performed
on a big stage like this,

597
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,968
but don't you worry. I got your back.

598
00:51:31,128 --> 00:51:32,968
Worry about yourself
and focus on getting the beat.

599
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,718
He's right. You started
too early at the final rehearsal.

600
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,478
-I'm worried.
-Don't you worry, boys.

601
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:40,598
I'll be good
once we start the actual performance.

602
00:51:40,688 --> 00:51:42,438
Hey, where's that thing from earlier?
Hang on.

603
00:51:42,518 --> 00:51:43,398
Calming pills.

604
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:45,478
-Can I have one too?
-Sorry. I've only got one.

605
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:46,728
Then can I have the half...

606
00:51:49,778 --> 00:51:50,858
All right.

607
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:54,908
Let's do this.

608
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:56,238
One, two...

609
00:51:56,328 --> 00:51:57,948
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Wait, me too.

610
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:00,248
I want to pee too.

611
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:14,138
My gosh. Look at
our hot seniors! Make some noise!

612
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:36,028
We watched the seniors' dance moves,
now we have to watch the freshmen too.

613
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:39,658
-For sure.
-The freshmen will take the stage next.

614
00:52:39,908 --> 00:52:43,538
Let me introduce
KNPU's four prettiest boys,

615
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,998
Wivengers!

616
00:54:23,558 --> 00:54:24,768
<i>That's stupid.</i>

617
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:27,098
<i>You don't know
if you're uncomfortable or excited?</i>

618
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:30,728
<i>It's confusing.
That's why I'm asking.</i>

619
00:54:30,808 --> 00:54:32,898
<i>Then meet someone
who doesn't confuse you.</i>

620
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:35,188
<i>If you really like someone,
you won't be confused.</i>

621
00:54:40,198 --> 00:54:41,488
Don't quit.

622
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:43,988
Let's see through it to the end.

623
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:37,798
How could they be sexier than me
when I'm dressed like this?

624
00:55:37,878 --> 00:55:38,918
-This is not fair.
-My gosh.

625
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:40,298
That's not true!

626
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,758
The freshmen
really made my heart flutter.

627
00:55:44,138 --> 00:55:48,598
Sadly, now we only have
the final highlight of the festival left.

628
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,888
However, this is the moment

629
00:55:50,978 --> 00:55:54,018
you can be as passionate
and crazy as you want.

630
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:56,228
It's time for the dance battle!

631
00:56:00,238 --> 00:56:01,528
Are you ready?

632
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,738
Yes!

633
00:56:03,738 --> 00:56:07,658
It looks like you're not ready.
I'll come back next year then.

634
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:14,128
All right. That's better.
Let me ask you again. Are you ready?

635
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,378
Yes!

636
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,048
Let's begin the dance battle!

637
00:56:19,128 --> 00:56:22,048
Student Squad One, come on out first.

638
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,688
Can we talk for a second?

639
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:42,448
What an outstanding move!

640
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:52,038
Do it before the professors
see you. No. They're going to freak out.

641
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:54,458
Student Squad One,
you can come back in.

642
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:56,878
Student Squad Two.
You don't want to lose, do you?

643
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:58,748
Come on out.
Student Squad Two!

644
00:56:58,838 --> 00:56:59,918
Student Squad Two!

645
00:57:10,268 --> 00:57:13,428
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me after the race.

646
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,228
-Yes.
-What is it?

647
00:57:20,528 --> 00:57:21,568
Hmm...

648
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,528
Well...

649
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:30,738
I...

650
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:35,078
I think I like...

651
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,468
<i>Let me say it first.</i>

652
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:53,808
<i>I know you like someone else,</i>

653
00:57:54,598 --> 00:57:55,808
<i>but I still like you.</i>

654
00:57:56,938 --> 00:57:57,898
<i>What?</i>

655
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,898
<i>But you're the one I like.</i>
