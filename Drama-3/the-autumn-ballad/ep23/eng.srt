18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,181
(Liang Residence)

19
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,120
Congratulations.

20
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,720
Official Tong!

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,239
Mr. Meng.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
(Liang Residence)

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,279
I heard you and Lord Liang
never saw eye to eye.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,400
Why would you come to his banquet?

25
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,000
The hearsay is getting too convincing.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,279
I'm just curious,

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,639
what kind of woman has the charm

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,319
to win Liang Yi's heart?

29
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,919
Could it really be Qiu Yan?

30
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,720
You said you recognized her look.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,160
But we'll know if it's her

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
when the concubine comes out.

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Well said!

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,559
After you.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,320
Thank you.

36
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,640
(Mude Hall)

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,664
(Liang Residence)

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,919
This is my humble wife,

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,119
Su Yiwan.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,559
Isn't this Qiu Yan?

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,487
(Autumn River)

42
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,559
Wan'er does share a similar look

43
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,720
with Qiu Yan.

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
When I first met Wan'er,

45
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,720
I mistook her for Qiu Yan too.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,119
Perhaps the rumors are true after all.

47
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,679
I thought the rumors
ended with the wise,

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
but the baseless hearsay

49
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,759
became even more ridiculous.

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,865
I've invited all of you

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,679
so all of you

52
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,960
can be my witness.

53
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,759
My concubine Su Yiwan

54
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,919
is a troupe actress from Jizhou.

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,880
She may look very much like Qiu Yan,

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,880
but she is definitely not her.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
Lord Liang, you insist she is

58
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,320
Su Yiwan

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,960
and that she merely
looks like Ms. Qiu Yan,

60
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,880
what can we say to deny it?

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,080
Yeah.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,000
But I find it very curious.

63
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,199
There had been many people
who share similar looks

64
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,160
throughout history,

65
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,479
why is it

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Lord Liang has had
the opportunity to meet

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,880
to meet both of them?

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,720
The probability is too slim.

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,479
How about this?

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,199
Everyone who got invited

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,800
is my friends and family.

72
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,080
There is no outsider here.

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,520
So, I might as well come clean.

74
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,119
I married Wan'er

75
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,800
because

76
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,080
she looks like Qiu Yan.

77
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,679
If my memories serve right,

78
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,279
it was the Third Young Lady
of the Qiu family

79
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,160
who was engaged to you.

80
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,240
Why would you

81
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,279
go through so much effort just to

82
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,399
get yourself a doppelganger
of Ms. Qiu Yan?

83
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,399
I wanted to marry the daughter
of the noble.

84
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,240
But after spending with Qiu Yan

85
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,960
at the Royal Academy,

86
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,559
I realized her beauty and qualities

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,080
are above her younger sister.

88
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,240
But unfortunately,

89
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,240
the two sisters tried to run away
from the Royal Academy

90
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,679
and ended up drowning in the river.

91
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,559
Then, I met Wan'er.

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,959
She has Qiu Yan's face.

93
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,519
I knew it was destiny,

94
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,559
so I made her my concubine.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,320
I thought you saved me
from a life of suffering,

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,480
but in the end,

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,839
you only see me as her shadow.

98
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,748
(Autumn River)

99
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,600
Nonsense.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,119
After spending time with you,

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,679
I realized

102
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,200
you were more charming than Qiu Yan.

103
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,880
She is your replacement.

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,640
You should have been honest with me.

105
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,239
I didn't bring this up because

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
I was worried you might be jealous.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,799
However, I like it

108
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,320
when you're jealous.

109
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,160
Since Ms. Su was in a troupe,

110
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,880
she must be an expert in art and music.

111
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,920
Indeed.

112
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,480
Perhaps Ms. Su

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,480
could sing a song for us.

114
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,920
Yes! Sing a song for us.

115
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,160
My best song is the Endless Yearning.

116
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,559
I hope you like it.

127
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,040
You played greatly.

128
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,279
Thank you for your applause.

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,760
Wan'er,

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,399
you should thank him.

131
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Thank you, Official Yuan.

132
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,720
Not at all,

133
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,440
Ms. Su is brilliant,

134
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,760
and she was willing to learn,

135
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,959
given her talent.

136
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,559
In mere days,

137
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,079
she went from knowing nothing

138
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,320
to mastering the at of playing guqin.

139
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,640
What an impressive feat.

140
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,559
Official Yuan,

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
you still don't believe

142
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,880
she is not Qiu Yan?

143
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,480
It's just a song.

144
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,160
It's a matter of practice makes perfect.

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,519
Anyone can master it in a short time
with enough practice.

146
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,679
This barely proves anything.

147
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,000
Mr. Meng,

148
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,600
you had seen Qiu Yan in person.

149
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,320
Do you think the two
are the same person?

150
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,320
Ms. Su and Qiu Yan share a similar face,

151
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,519
but she is much more interesting

152
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,640
than Qiu Yan.

153
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,559
Lord Liang,

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,079
the Firewood Office is an amazing place.

155
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,600
I wonder if you could find me

156
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,347
such a wonderful wife.

157
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,679
Mr. Meng, with good deeds,

158
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,480
you will be blessed
with a good marriage.

159
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,559
Mr. Meng,
you spoke with confidence.

160
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,640
Perhaps your words

161
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,399
could serve as evidence.

162
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,839
That is beyond me.

163
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,519
After all, Ms. Qiu Yan and I

164
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,839
weren't very close.

165
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,200
Official Yuan,

166
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,320
what can I do to convince you?

167
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,640
It just so happened

168
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,760
that I know someone

169
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,279
who once helped Su Yiwan.

170
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,399
He missed Su Yiwan very deeply.

171
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,880
He heard that

172
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,959
she had become Marquis Weiyuan's wife

173
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,640
and begged for me

174
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
to let him meet Su Yiwan again.

175
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:39,760
I think

176
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,119
an old friend wouldn't
be wrong about her.

177
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,399
It's just a small favor.

178
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,399
Would you say no to that, Lord Liang?

179
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,040
What if I refuse?

180
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,279
Wan'er is married to me,

181
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,119
her past is now behind her.

182
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,640
If you insist on bringing out

183
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,359
her old acquaintance

184
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,559
on our wedding day,

185
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,079
perhaps you are trying
to get on my nerve.

186
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,119
If Su Yiwan reunites
with her old acquaintance,

187
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,000
all the rumors about

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,279
you abetting Qiu Yan

189
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,559
will be proven to be false.

190
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,799
Official Yuan is right.

191
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,399
Since he's already here,

192
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
let him take a look.

193
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,760
We can always ask him
to leave afterward.

194
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,480
-Yes.
-Indeed.

195
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,200
He has a point.

196
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,239
Fine.

197
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,519
Bring him here.

198
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,960
Sir, could I take a closer look?

199
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,520
Yao Gai,

200
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,479
is Lord Liang's beloved concubine

201
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,359
the very same girl you knew?

202
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,159
Wan'er!

203
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,599
Wan'er!

204
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,080
Why didn't you tell me

205
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,799
about your wedding?

206
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,559
Are you going to forget about our past

207
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,640
simply because I had fallen from grace?

208
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,119
I've sent every one

209
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,719
who knew Su Yiwan away.

210
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,960
Yuan Lang won't find

211
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,119
anything on you.

212
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
If we turned down everyone

213
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,440
who knew Su Yiwan,

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,719
that would draw suspicion.

215
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,679
Perhaps we could send Song Luo

216
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,559
to bait Yuan Lang

217
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,520
with a false lead?

218
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,320
That is a sound plan,

219
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,919
but it's hard to execute.

220
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,679
We need someone to cooperate.

221
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,640
If that person has a
complicated background,

222
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,799
we'll invite trouble to ourselves.

223
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,440
We need someone we trust

224
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,440
whose background is true
and verifiable.

225
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,400
A person comes to mind.

226
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
Do you remember

227
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,080
a person named Yao Gai

228
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,520
when we tracked down the counterfeit?

229
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,159
He was nothing but a gambler.

230
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,919
Yuan Lang might buy him off.

231
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,599
Not all gamblers

232
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,159
are blinded by greed.

233
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,840
After the work is done,

234
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,440
the Firewood Office will keep you safe.

235
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,080
Take the money for now.

236
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,239
But...

237
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,080
When I needed help,

238
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,200
only Ms. Qiu Yan cared about me.

239
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,280
I've lost my status,

240
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,440
but I am

241
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,239
still grateful for her help.

242
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,719
As the saying goes,

243
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,599
any kindness should be repaid in double.

244
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:42,840
Lord Liang,

245
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,320
you can count on me.

246
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,799
Qiu Yan was right about you.

247
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,159
Yao Gai,

248
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,919
look closely.

249
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,840
How can she really be Su Yiwan?

250
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,679
She is Su Yiwan!

251
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,840
I've known her for years!

252
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,119
I can recognize her even if she's

253
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,479
burned to a cinder!

254
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Get lost.

255
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:10,840
Wait.

256
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,599
A mere beggar like you

257
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,479
has no right to say her name.

258
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,960
He disrespected Yiwan,

259
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,559
and therefore disrespected me.

260
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,799
I'm not as merciful as Official Yuan.

261
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,320
Song Jin.

262
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,080
Yes.

263
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,840
Take him to the Firewood Office.

264
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
I'll deal with him later.

265
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,159
Move!

266
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,599
Gentlemen,

267
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,880
today is a day

268
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,440
of great songs, wine,

269
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,799
and beauty.

270
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,559
Do not spoil the mood for everyone

271
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,840
over a lowly peasant.

272
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:42,400
Indeed.

273
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,719
Yao Gai is just a thug

274
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,599
with ill intentions.

275
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,080
He can't be trusted.

276
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,960
That wasn't what you said earlier.

277
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,239
Perhaps I heard it wrong.

278
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,039
I invited you to enjoy my banquet,

279
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,840
not to ruin it.

280
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,039
If you don't stop questioning

281
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,840
her identity,

282
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,039
I will make you pay.

283
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,840
There are missing dots in the death

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
of women of the Qiu family.

285
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,119
Lord Liang, you're caught up
in a scandal.

286
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,840
Inspecting the officers

287
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,239
is the duty
of the Main Administrative Office.

288
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:12,960
Do you

289
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,479
really think that

290
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,039
you can be the only exception?

291
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,080
You are right.

292
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,159
The title comes with duties.

293
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,599
However, what else can I do

294
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,320
to prove to you

295
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,840
that my concubine is not Qiu Yan?

296
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:27,719
I checked.

297
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,799
The people from Su Yiwan's hometown

298
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,719
claimed that her back

299
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,039
was once burned.

300
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,039
There is a scar with
the shape of a willow leaf.

301
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,919
If she

302
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,840
doesn't have the scar on her back,

303
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,440
she is, without a doubt Qiu Yan.

304
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,799
She is my concubine,

305
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,400
how will you check her body?

306
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,400
Don't worry, Lord Liang.

307
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,320
I am not a pervert.

308
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,239
We may ask the noblewomen here
and their servants

309
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,719
to verify it inside the house.

310
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,599
Never mind.

311
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,400
We can do it here behind the screen.

312
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,320
That is the only way

313
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,239
to prove my innocence.

314
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,400
I am but a lowly person,

315
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,159
I don't have the luxury
of pride and honor.

316
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,599
Official Yuan,

317
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,960
let's get it over with.

318
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,119
I was told the Firewood Office
specialized in the art of disguise.

319
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,119
A fake scar is more than easy
for them to make.

320
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,559
The noblewomen here

321
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,159
rarely saw any gory images.

322
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm afraid they can't
tell the difference.

323
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,840
I brought
from the Main Administrative Office

324
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,479
a bottle of disguise solvent.

325
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,440
This liquid can dissolve

326
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,119
any forms of fake scars.

327
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,000
Su Yiwan,

328
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,039
if you are not Qiu Yan in disguise,

329
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,239
apply this liquid to your scar in front

330
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,440
of the noblewomen.

331
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,640
Official Yuan, don't cross the line.

332
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,719
There is a boundary

333
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,080
to everything.

334
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,679
What's the matter?

335
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,679
Are you scared, Lord Liang?

336
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,640
Official Yuan, both you and my son
are inspectors of the officials.

337
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,919
You have doubts

338
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,760
and are relentless because
it's your duty.

339
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,239
- Madam Jin.
- Madam Jin.

340
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:07,760
Liang Yi,

341
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,880
you should clear the doubt
for Official Yuan.

342
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,679
Mother...

343
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,960
People of the Marquis Weiyuan Residence

344
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,320
are law-abiding citizens.

345
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,599
If Su Yiwan

346
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,960
is indeed an impostor

347
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,239
and a daughter of a criminal,

348
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:32,359
I will be the first to turn her in

349
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,359
to the authority
of the Fengjing Prefecture.

350
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,239
I appreciate the understanding, Old Madam.

351
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,039
Official Yuan.

352
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,479
I used the solvent you provided.

353
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,239
Su Yiwan's scar

354
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,000
didn't dissolve.

355
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,239
Official Yuan,

356
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,559
what more do you have to say?

357
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,760
You've had her scar checked.

358
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,320
I want you to clear her name.

359
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,559
Tell everyone here

360
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,719
that my concubine is Su Yiwan

361
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,159
and not Qiu Yan in disguise.

362
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,359
I have work to see to.

363
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,119
I must take my leave now.

364
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,400
My guests,

365
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,000
it was just a minor interruption.

366
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,640
Let's not spoil the mood here.

367
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,400
Welcome inside and enjoy the food.

368
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,320
Welcome.

369
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,919
Thank you, Madam Jin.

370
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:38,493
(Mude Hall)

371
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,760
How did you manage

372
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,719
to fool Song Luo?

373
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,320
Fooling her?

374
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,840
I fooled no one.

375
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,640
You said the fake scar

376
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,599
could fool the noblewomen

377
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,839
but not Yuan Lang.

378
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,839
If they found out the scar was fake,

379
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:17,520
(Autumn River)
not only would you be in trouble,

380
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,839
your mother would be in danger too.

381
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,920
I couldn't take the risk.

382
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,839
And this time,

383
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,719
I was one step ahead of you.

384
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,319
Why would you hurt yourself for that?

385
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,400
Are you upset about it?

386
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,439
My lord,

387
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,479
the guests are waiting for us.

388
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:40,880
Liang Yi!

389
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,359
Qin Xuan.

390
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,280
I know you are not a fan

391
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,000
of social events,

392
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,680
that's why I didn't invite you.

393
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,040
But I'm glad that

394
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,239
you're willing to come.

395
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,079
Allow me to introduce her to you.

396
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,160
This is my concubine,

397
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,400
her name is Su Yiwan.

398
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
Greetings, Mr. Qin.

399
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,199
You're Lord Liang's concubine?

400
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,239
Your name is Su Yiwan?

401
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,000
Qin Xuan!

402
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,280
Qin Xuan!

403
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,680
Look at you!

404
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,719
Why are you late?

405
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:40,560
That's right,

406
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,520
you were madly in love

407
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,760
with Ms. Qiu Yan.

408
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,959
Look at Ms. Su here,

409
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,119
doesn't she look the same as Qiu Yan?

410
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,680
Liang,

411
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,839
let's go inside.

412
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,880
Everyone is waiting for you.

413
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,959
Qin Xuan, see you inside.

414
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:03,640
Let's go.

415
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:07,162
(Mude Hall)

416
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,040
Stop standing there,

417
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,239
come have a drink with me.

418
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,439
Congratulations, Lord Liang.

419
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,520
Liang!

420
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,119
Today is a great day!

421
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:25,520
You two should have a cross-cupped wine

422
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,040
so your marriage
will be wonderful and happy,

423
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,760
and that your love will last forever!

424
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,479
Yes!

425
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:34,839
Come on.

426
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:36,880
Wait.

427
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,520
Do you even know how to do it?

428
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,199
Liang,

429
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,719
you're a great detective,

430
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,719
but I know so much more
about love affairs than you.

431
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,839
Qin Xuan,

432
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,680
come here.

433
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,400
We should demonstrate
the right way for them.

434
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,520
A cross-cupped wine

435
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,479
should be done this way.

436
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,680
Stop standing there like a tree, drink.

437
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,640
- Drink!
- Drink!

438
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,520
Come, Wan'er. Drink!

439
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
- Drink!
- Drink!

440
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Wonderful!

441
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Great!

442
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,239
Ms. Qiu Yan is having a great day.

443
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:20,920
Qin Xuan,

444
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,839
she's not Qiu Yan.

445
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:25,839
You're right.

446
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,599
Qin Xuan,

447
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,000
the Qiu family was in a boat accident.

448
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,439
You've seen Ms. Qiu Yan's body yourself.

449
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,280
Qin Xuan's heart belonged

450
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,719
to Ms. Qiu Yan.

451
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,520
He just lost a loved one.

452
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,359
I can understand if he
mistook Wan'er for her.

453
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,239
Right?

454
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,119
Ladies and gentlemen,

455
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,680
may I have your attention?

456
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,959
The lost is gone,

457
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,280
I'm sorry for the loss.

458
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,199
It's apparent Mr. Qin

459
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,000
is a man of loyalty.

460
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,119
For quality alone,

461
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,119
I raise a toast

462
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
to Mr. Qin!

463
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
To Mr. Qin's health!

464
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,359
Never mind.

465
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,839
My only question for Lord Liang

466
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,400
is why he didn't tell me

467
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,719
about his wedding.

468
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,680
Do you think I wouldn't come

469
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,599
to give you my blessing?

470
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,160
That is

471
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,880
very disappointing.

472
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,920
Mr. Qin, you're drunk.

473
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,599
I think

474
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,880
you should get some rest for now.

475
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,520
Do you really hate to see me?

476
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,959
I get it now.

477
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,680
The truth is,

478
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Qin Xuan's heart and soul

479
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,280
now belongs to Ms. Qiu Yan.

480
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,760
But fate

481
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,040
has a sick sense of humor

482
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,439
and let Lord Liang here marry a woman

483
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,400
who looked exactly like Qiu Yan.

484
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,920
Come here!

485
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,920
Why are you grabbing me?

486
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,439
Come here.

487
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm not finished yet!

488
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,760
- I...
- Just go.

489
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,359
Let's carry on.

490
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,199
Fine.

491
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,920
It was wrong of me

492
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,640
not to invite you.

493
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,000
I apologize.

494
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:54,959
Lord Liang.

495
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,719
That is unnecessary.

496
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,199
Let's drink.

497
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,719
I only came here

498
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,239
to congratulate you on your wedding.

499
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,239
I'll drink a toast to you, Lord Liang.

500
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,959
And to you too, Ms. Su.

501
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,920
First of all,

502
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,640
I wish you two a wonderful marriage

503
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,119
and have a harmonious family.

504
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,239
Secondly,

505
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,479
to my friendship with Lord Liang.

506
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,760
He and I were childhood friends.

507
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,760
Our friendship has been
simple and peaceful,

508
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,400
but when the time calls for it,

the third toast to you.

518
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,040
Based on Mr. Meng's story,

519
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,040
you were deeply in love

520
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,199
with Ms. Qiu Yan.

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,760
But sadly, she lived a short life

522
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,239
and you couldn't be with her.

523
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,160

Goodbye, Mr. Qin.

(Liang Residence)
Qin Xuan.

558
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,400
- Wait, Lord Liang.
- That lady is not Qiu Yan.

559
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,040
Lord Liang, goodbye.

560
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:57,560
Goodbye.

561
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,520
Qin Xuan!

562
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:01,760
Remember,

563
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,079
that lady is not Qiu Yan!

564
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,512

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,280
Liang.

566
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,800
Stay vigor.

567
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,479
Official Tong, goodbye.

568
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,239
Not bad at all!

569
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:17,839
Goodbye.

570
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
You are alive.

571
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:32,880
Great.

572
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,479
You being alive

573
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:42,000
is the greatest thing
in this entire world.

574
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,079
Mr. Qin, you're drunk.

575
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:43,880
I am not her.

576
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,160
Qin Xuan, you had too much drink.

577
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,599
Song Jin, help Mr. Qin to his carriage.

578
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,719
Young Master Qin.

579
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,479
I'm fine.

580
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:19,106
(Liang Residence)

581
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,839
Come with me.

582
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,839
Sit down!

583
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,719
Sit down!

584
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,520
Sit down!

585
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,719
Where is the wound?

586
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,640
That's too reckless!

587
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:32,959
Even with the Jinchuang ointment,

588
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,400
the burn injury damages your tissues.

589
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,199
Without medicine to disinfect it,

590
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,560
your muscle

591
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,160
will still be damaged
after the wound heals.

592
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,439
Having a fever and
inflammation is the last,

593
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,199
you could have lost your life!

594
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,680
Was there a better way?

595
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,560
What happened today wasn't unexpected.

596
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,079
But I never thought

597
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,959
Qin Xuan would come here.

598
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,520
Thankfully, Yuan Lang was already gone.

599
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,040
The rumors are all over the city.

600
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,800
He must have known.

601
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,319
However,

602
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,439
I thought Qiu Min

603
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,040
would have stopped him at all costs.

604
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,079
It seemed

605
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,760
he never forgot about you.

606
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:46,439
Could you teach me
self-defense tomorrow?

607
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,560
Do you not trust me to keep you safe?

608
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,640
We can't always be together.

609
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,119
Even if we were,

610
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,199
we might not

611
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,599
always get lucky like yesterday.

612
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,760
If I know self-defense,

613
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:01,880
I can protect myself.

614
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:05,839
Sure.

615
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,160
Let's treat the wound.

616
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:11,119
Sure.

617
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,040
Does it hurt?

618
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,599
Not at all.

619
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:51,621
(As Loyal As A Subject)
(As Pure As Snow)

620
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:02,920
Qin Xuan,

621
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,680
you could lay down on my lap.

622
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,000
That should make you feel better.

623
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,160
Qin Xuan,

624
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,280
was that Qiu Yan?

625
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,880
It was her.

626
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,359
She is still alive.

627
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:28,920
But she...

628
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,520
Did she say anything to you?

629
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,640
Nothing at all.

630
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,439
She will never talk to me again.

631
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,040
Why?

632
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,640
You both survived the accident,

633
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,959
but she went to Liang Yi

634
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,760
and you came to me.

635
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,479
Why was it

636
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,439
that I met you first

637
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,239
and not her?

638
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,479
Why?

639
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,114
(Mude Hall)

640
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,719
The move set is the same,
but you can be flexible

641
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,599
and adapt to situations.

642
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:45,800
Greetings, Old Madam.

643
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
It hurts!

644
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,719
It hurts.

645
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,000
You tried to trick me again.

646
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,800
It hurts!

647
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,640
Let go!

648
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,439
Again.

649
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,439
Song Jin.

650
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,719
I must talk to Qin Xuan.

651
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,160
No one must interrupt.

652
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,040
Yes.

653
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,319
I pondered on it last night.

654
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,839
Why would you plan a rescue

655
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,719
without telling me?

656
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,040
Why would you not include me

657
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,520
in your plans for the Qiu family?

658
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,839
Why wouldn't you tell me

659
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,839
Qiu Yan was alive?

660
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,599
After much thought,

661
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,319
I told myself

662
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,640
you were trying to protect me.

663
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,599
You kept me in the dark

664
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,680
to keep me safe.

665
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,359
You wouldn't be here

666
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,880
if you thought it through.

667
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,760
Yes.

668
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,920
There is one thing

669
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,479
that still eludes me.

670
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,079
Is making her your concubine

671
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,160
the only way to help her?

672
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,719
Qiu Yan broke up with you

673
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,079
at the Royal Academy.

674
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,640
Whether she is in love
or becomes anyone's concubine

675
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,959
is none of your concern.

676
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,239
Of course it is!

677
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,199
You are my friend.

678
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,680
Qiu Yan is the woman I love.

679
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:24,839
Besides,

680
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,599
you're hiding her for me.

681
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,280
You got it all wrong.

682
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,400
I didn't save her for you.

683
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,640
I am willing to devise plans for her,

684
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,800
to risk my life for her,

685
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,400
and save her family for her

686
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,839
because

687
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,599
I like her.

688
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,359
You like her?

689
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,000
Liang Yi,

690
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,920
I thought you went to great lengths

691
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,400
to interfere with our relationship

692
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,239
because you hated her.

693
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,920
Or perhaps...

694
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,959
Were you already in love
with her back then?

695
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,680
Was that why you interfered?

696
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,119
I did take her for someone

697
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,160
who was using me for her agenda.

698
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,560
That wasn't a lie.

699
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,479
When did you start to have

700
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,399
feelings for her?

701
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,560
I don't know for sure.

702
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,840
At first, she struck me as

703
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,040
a very conceited person.

704
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,760
She was witty,

705
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,159
full of schemes,

706
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,679
(an attention seeker,)

707
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,159
(selfish,)

708
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,959
(and only ever cared for herself.)

709
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,399
However,

710
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,719
at some point,

711
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,479
I had this yearning to see her,

712
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,399
(to have petty arguments with her,)

713
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:40,040
(and listen to her
analysis on mysteries.)

714
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,199
(She knows the name of the fan owner.)

715
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,399
(She wants to)

716
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,479
(thank you.)

717
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,159
You were taking advantage of me

718
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,199
and stole her from me!

719
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:58,840
Liang Yi,

720
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,199
you shouldn't rob me of my love!

721
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,239
You should be ashamed!

722
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,760
Yes, I shouldn't take her from you,

723
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,159
but I was never a good man.

724
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,959
For Qiu Yan,

725
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:06,959
I'll abandon my righteousness.

726
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,360
Listen closely.

727
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,320
I will do everything I can
to have her love.

728
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,840
I want to take her from you.

729
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,080
You can fight back if you dare.

730
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:15,919
Fine.

731
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,639
I...

732
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,800
What's wrong?

733
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Are you giving up already?

734
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,879
You slept with her younger sister right after

735
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,479
you promised to wait for her return!

736
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,959
How do you know?

737
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,800
I've been monitoring

738
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,840
both you and Qiu Min.

739
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,120
If I didn't,

740
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,239
would you be safe living in hiding

741
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,600
with a daughter of a criminal?

742
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,280
Does Qiu Yan know?

743
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,159
Yes.

744
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,840
She knows.

745
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,199
No.

746
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,320
I must talk to her.

747
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,479
I need to explain.

748
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,120
What is there to be explained?

749
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,000
To tell her you couldn't help it,

750
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,479
that you betrayed her

751
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:04,360
and you want forgiveness?

752
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,239
Stand back.

753
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,479
What's done is done.

754
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,679
Own it.

755
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,679
You're a grown man!

756
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,600
Own your mistake!

757
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:16,280
Stand aside.

758
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,399
Stand back!

759
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,879
Why didn't you dodge?

760
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:23,959
Why?

761
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,159
Qin Xuan.

762
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,239
Throughout the years,

763
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,919
I've let you win in Chuiwan matches

764
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,360
and sword fights.

765
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,159
But when it comes to Qiu Yan,

766
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,679
I won't pull any punches.

767
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,120
You seem absent-minded.

768
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,239
I'm thinking

769
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,479
about the touching speech you gave.

770
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,959
Even I find it heart-warming.

771
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,000
You eavesdropped on me.

772
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,959
I didn't.

773
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:20,199
If you hadn't been so compelling,

774
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,800
I wouldn't have overheard it.

775
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,639
Sir.

776
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:27,719
Aren't you going to strike
while the iron is hot?

777
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:31,120
I doubt Ms. Qiu Yan is fond of

778
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,439
the more womanly stuff.

779
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
She likes solving mysteries.

780
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,959
Let's buy her a torture kit!

781
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:42,840

00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,280
After the case with the He family

783

was solved,

784
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:50,120
she was quite interested

785
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,000
in the city's sky lantern stall.

786
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,879
Yes!

787
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,679
Impressive, Sir!

788
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,159
What's with the blindfold?

789
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,919
Start talking before I leave.

790
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:08,639
Stop talking.

791
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,479
