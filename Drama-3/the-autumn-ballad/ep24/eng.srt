=Episode 24=

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,055
(Firewood Office)

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,760
Sir!

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,959
Sir?

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,879
Sir!

22
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,519
News from the borders.

23
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:47,959
Our informant says

24
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,680
that Qiu Yi developed heat illness

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,440
on his way to Gannan.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,760
It has been four to five days.

27
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,319
A physician tended to him,
but he still hasn't gotten any better.

28
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,160
Don't tell Qiu Yan about this first.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,720
She won't be able to help anyway.

30
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,239
It'll only make her feel more troubled.

31
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,040
You're right.

32
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, right.

33
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,080
How is the search
for the auspicious item coming along?

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,000
The treasure recorded
in the Hongzhen Sutra

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,839
refers to a pearl of immortality.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,479
Our men found a large Eastpearl

37
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,520
in Japan last time.

38
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,759
But the Eastpearl was too fragile.

39
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,759
It shattered and crumbled
when the craftsmen tried to work on it.

40
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,440
After that,
we tried lapis lazuli and Amazonites,

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,320
but they were both too common

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,279
and ordinary.

43
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,679
Sir.

44
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,360
Do you remember

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,839
the family heirloom
back at Duke Lu's residence

46
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,839
when we seized the place?

47
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,800
That Night-luminescent Pearl

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,399
is very similar to the pearl
mentioned in the Hongzhen Sutra.

49
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:34,360
They regarded
that pearl as their lifeblood.

50
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,119
Sir, you were magnanimous

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,039
and spared the pearl
when you confiscated their residence.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm sure it must still be with Gao Yang.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
I'll get our men to keep searching.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,520
The world is vast.

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
We must be able to find a pearl somehow.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
We're out of time.

57
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,320
Qiu Yi is a scholar.
He has a weak physique.

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
He has had a tiring journey,

59
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:55,039
and he even developed
heat illness in a remote place.

60
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,880
I doubt he can hold on for long.

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,279
Liang Yi?

62
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,199
Why are you here?

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,279
To see how an old friend has been.

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,919
I, Gao Yang,

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
have never done anything harmful.

66
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm sure I have my blessings.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,279
You barely make ends meet,

68
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,759
yet you're still holding on
to your family heirloom.

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,039
I wonder if I should call you tough

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,199
or a fool.

71
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,880
You want that pearl?

72
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:00,759
Give me an offer.

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,880
Give you an offer?

74
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,960
How much are the honor and dignity

75
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,639
of the Gao Family worth then?

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,320
Give it up.

77
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:17,920
I have nothing else to lose.

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,399
At worst, I'll just lose my life.

79
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:24,519
I never harm the innocents in the family
when I carry out my duty.

80
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,720
When Duke Lu killed my father,

81
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,559
I took him down,

82
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,040
but I spared you.

83
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,640
Why must you force yourself to your end?

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
I came

85
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,040
to offer you a chance today.

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,239
If you miss it,

87
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
you'll never get another chance
to start over again.

88
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,679
Are you going to write a letter

89
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,239
to vindicate my father then?

90
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,279
Impossible.

91
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,760
You know His Majesty's nature.

92
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,920
It is not within my power to do so

93
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,359
in the current dynasty.

94
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,720
Give me a price.

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,640
If it was the money I was after,

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,600
I would've sold that pearl years ago.

97
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,160
Submit a memorial, then.

98
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,640
Tell His Majesty
that the Gao Family helped you

99
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,040
or the Gao Family
turned over a new leaf or something.

100
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,239
Ask His Majesty

101
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,200
to restore my family's name and status.

102
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:31,880
Gao Yang.

103
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,040
It seems you are determined
to make things hard for me.

104
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:39,880
Yes.

105
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,000
After all, who knew
that there would come a day

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
when you would have
to ask me of something?

107
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,160
It is karmic retribution indeed.

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
You ruined my family back then.

109
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,480
Now, I want you

110
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,880
to help your father's murderer
with your very own hands.

111
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,959
I want to see you suffer
with my own eyes.

112
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:00,959
Otherwise,

113
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,679
you won't get
even a shard of that pearl!

114
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,200
Father.

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,890
(Memorial Tablet
of Beloved Father Liang Yuansu)

116
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,000
Will you blame me?

117
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,000
When you died by Duke Lu's arrow,

118
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,600
I vowed

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,119
I would have Duke Lu
pay for it with his life

120
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,200
and ruin his name.

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,640
That I would crush the Gao Family
and have them never be restored.

122
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:58,257
(Memorial Tablet
of Beloved Father Liang Yuansu)

123
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,799
I am at my wits' end.

124
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,920
She is very important to me.

125
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,760
This matter
is very important to me as well.

126
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,040
Just like when I avenged you back then.

127
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,880
Blame me if you must.

128
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,399
I am unfilial.

129
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,480
(Memorial Tablet
of Beloved Father Liang Yuansu)

130
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,279
My lord!

131
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,760
Why did you drink so much?

132
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I'll have someone carry you inside.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
No need.

134
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,559
Don't alert anyone.

135
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,279
Just help me inside.

136
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,440
Slowly.

137
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,880
Are you all right?

138
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,239
Why did you drink so much?

139
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,079
Are you all right?

140
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,320
Are you all right?

141
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,239
I would like some water.

142
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,079
Water...

143
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,959
All right.

144
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,079
Wait here.

145
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,280
Here.

146
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,440
Drink some.

147
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,719
Where did you get this?

148
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:43,760
Today,

149
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,400
I was looking
for something in the chest you kept

150
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,159
your childhood belongings.

151
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,599
I didn't know you wrote
a book about investigations.

152
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,960
Do you remember when I told you

153
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,799
back at the imperial park...

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,039
What are you doing?

155
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm hungry.

156
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,320
Get me something to eat.

157
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:14,919
All right.

158
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
(I couldn't read much as a child,)

159
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,320
(but I wanted to study.)

160
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,599
My mother tried to cultivate my interest

161
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,919
by having me read books
about investigations.

162
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,799
I remember the first one I read
was a half-scroll handwritten copy.

163
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,719
It was called...

164
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,039
"Collection of Odd Occurrences."

165
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,039
Miss Qiu Min?

166
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,239
Miss Qiu Min?

167
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
Sir!

168
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
There's a letter here!

169
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,640
(Don't worry, Qin Xuan.)

170
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,479
(I won't take my life
and cause trouble for you.)

171
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,039
(I just want to find a place and hide.)

172
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,119
(Perhaps hide away forever.)

173
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,520
(I know in your heart,)

174
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,320
(I mean only disgrace and shame.)

175
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,559
(But to me,)

176
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,479
(it wasn't.)

177
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,039
(That night)

178
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,760
(was the best night of my life.)

179
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,520
(Qin Xuan,)

180
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,760
(I promised)

181
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,000
(I wouldn't get in
between you and Qiu Yan.)

182
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,960
(Qiu Yan is still alive.)

183
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,280
(It is unsuitable for me
to stay here any longer.)

184
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,039
(I hope you will forget about me soon.)

185
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,520
(At least, then,)

186
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:11,599
(you wouldn't hate me
and despise me anymore.)

187
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,799
She is weak and vulnerable.

188
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,239
Wherever could she go?

189
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,280
No. I have to find her.

190
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,640
Wait!

191
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,400
Sir!

192
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,880
We don't have a single clue right now.

193
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,719
Searching for her right now

194
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,640
is as if looking
for a needle in the sea.

195
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,239
And she is avoiding you
and hiding from you.

196
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,919
How are we going to find her?

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I failed Qiu Yan,

198
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,039
and now I have failed Qiu Min too.

199
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,679
Liang Yi was right.

200
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,320
I am not a man.

201
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,479
Mother.

202
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,039
Mother.

203
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,200
Mother.

204
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,440
Qiu Min.

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Where did you go?

206
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,760
You had us worried to death.

207
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,679
Qiu Yan went looking for you as well.

208
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,440
But she never came back.

209
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,599
Fortunately, Lord Liang sent us a letter

210
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,919
to let us know that she was all right.

211
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,880
All that matters is that you're back.

212
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,080
You didn't get seen on your way back,

213
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
did you?

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,080
I was wrong.

215
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,200
I made you guys worry about me.

216
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,679
It's all right.

217
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,239
Third Young Lady.

218
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,520
Didn't you tell us not to look for you?

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,479
What?

220
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,039
Back with your tail
in between your legs?

221
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,200
Madam.

222
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,320
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,559
So you know you should be sorry, huh?

224
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,359
How could you do what you did?

225
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,960
You had your sister take such a risk

226
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,640
to go and look for you.

227
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,320
Thankfully, my daughter is capable.

228
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,960
She even managed
to become Marquis Weiyuan's concubine.

229
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,320
Unlike someone else

230
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,919
who still had to come back in shame...

231
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,679
That's enough.

232
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,799
No one will take you as a mute
even if you don't speak.

233
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,440
Go inside and rest.

234
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,320
First Sister-in-law.

235
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,840
Was I wrong?

236
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,159
She caused us so much trouble.

237
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,559
Why do you make it sound

238
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,200
as if she did a good deed
by coming back?

239
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,039
We still have so much work to do,

240
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,159
and you're letting her rest?

241
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,280
I'll go and do the chores right away.

242
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,640
Qiu Min.

243
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,320
I'll help you.

244
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,880
First Sister-in-law, don't be silly.

245
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,479
If you're nice to Yan'er,

246
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,599
she can at least look after us.

247
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,000
To her?

248
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,039
What could we possibly get?

249
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:23,060
(Autumn River)

250
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,443
(Autumn River)

251
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,799
Old Madam, help me!

252
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,440
The paper kite is going to fly away!

253
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,559
Quick!

254
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,080
You need to control it.

255
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,559
Look.

256
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,119
Here.

257
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:48,159
If not, the string will break.

258
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:49,559
Like this.

259
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,799
What a nice wind. With force.

260
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,039
Look.

261
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,520
Look.

262
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,559
Look at how high it is flying.

263
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,559
It's beautiful.

264
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,280
It is flying so high.

265
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,319
Look.

266
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,920
This is my first time trying it,
so I only made a soft-winged kite.

267
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,319
Please teach me how to make a hard-winged
kite and a long-string kite next time.

268
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:19,680
You went through a lot of effort.

269
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,719
I had a lot of fun today.

270
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,839
Old Madam,

271
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,280
did you know

272
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,239
His lordship wrote a book
about investigations?

273
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,119
How did you know?

274
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,520
Did he show you the manuscript?

275
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,599
I stumbled across it
when I was looking for materials

276
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,680
to make the paper kite yesterday.

277
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,439
I've read it before

278
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,599
when I still lived with my family.

279
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,599
I loved it.

280
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,640
I was upset for quite a while

281
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,599
when the author
never wrote an ending back then.

282
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,839
I never expected
that it was His lordship who wrote it.

283
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,719
But why did he stop writing?

284
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,439
Yi'er

285
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,160
was completely different back then.

286
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,839
He was playful and boisterous.

287
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,839
Music, chess, literature, art.
He could do everything.

288
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,160
Everything has changed

289
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,520
since his father passed away

290
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:15,920
six years ago.

291
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:17,041
(Liang Residence)

292
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,599
(Duke Lu was overbearing
in his manners back then.)

293
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:23,880
(When the late marquis went hunting
with His Majesty, he took advantage)

294
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:27,800
(of the situation and pretended
to have shot his steed on accident.)

295
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:32,359
(After he was injured,
the late marquis lost a lot of blood)

296
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,760
(and fell unconscious
as he developed a high fever.)

297
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,160
(He passed away)

298
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,359
(in less than a day.)

299
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:45,233
(Memorial Tablet
of Beloved Husband Liang Yuansu)

300
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,863
(Memorial Tablet
of Beloved Husband Liang Yuansu)

301
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,319
(Yi'er vowed
he would avenge his father.)

302
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,880
(So he put away
all of the things he liked)

303
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,319
(in a chest)

304
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,560
(and never touched them again.)

305
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,439
I've heard of this.

306
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:24,560
Four years ago, Duke Lu was exiled

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,119
because of a theft of a rice warehouse
under his rule.

308
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,959
He died of sudden illness
during the journey.

309
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,119
His lordship did that?

310
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,800
Actually,
before the late marquis passed away,

311
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,520
he left Yi'er a letter.

312
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:49,079
He repeatedly told him
not to avenge him.

313
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,880
Both of us wanted him
to live a carefree life

314
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,680
without worries or burdens.

315
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,839
But Yi'er was stubborn and persistent.

316
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
He kept everything to himself

317
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,119
and wouldn't tell me anything.

318
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,560
In hindsight,

319
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,160
I was a failure

320
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,680
as a mother.

321
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,280
His lordship may not say it out loud,

322
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,680
but in his heart,

323
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,319
he respects you very much.

324
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:21,400
Who knows how he feels in his heart?

325
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,599
Wan'er.

326
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,199
Only when he took you as his concubine

327
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,400
did I manage to see
that he still had feelings and emotions.

328
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,680
I'll be honest with you.

329
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,680
At first, I liked you

330
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:41,959
because I wanted
to see Yi'er start a family

331
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,319
and carry on the family name.

332
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
But now,

333
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,359
I've come to understand more and more

334
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,560
why he thinks so highly of you.

335
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,760
Wan'er,

336
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,439
will you always stay with Yi'er?

337
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,959
(I recently captured bandits
from Northern Liang.)

338
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,160
(During the operation,)

339
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,959
(Gao Yang and his clan
had provided their full assistance.)

340
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,199
(They have made a great contribution.)

341
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,439
(Back then, Duke Lu)

342
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,319
(was corrupt and made little
of the people's lives.)

343
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,280
(He endangered the people's lives.)

344
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,640
(Memorial)
(But his son, Gao Yang, served the nation.)

345
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,680
(His loyalty is evident.)

346
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,599
(I implore Your Majesty
to consider his loyalty)

347
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,760
(and the fact)

348
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,599
(that he is a descendant
of the Grand Princess' clan,)

349
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,359
(to allow him
to redeem himself with his merits,)

350
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,920
(restore his name and status)

351
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,640
(to show Your Majesty's benevolence.)

352
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,520
Find a skilled craftsman

353
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
and have them do as I say.

354
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,359
Yes, sir.

355
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,199
I will be counting on you tomorrow.

356
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,800
You have gone to painstaking lengths

357
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,680
for the Qiu Family indeed, Lord Liang.

358
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,920
I was the one who sought out
the Qiu Family back then.

359
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,439
Now, the Qiu Family is in trouble.

360
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:32,680
If I don't help them,

361
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,560
I would be too cold-blooded
and lose the hearts of others.

362
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,839
Indeed.

363
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,640
Just like how
you sought me out back then.

364
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Anti-corruption efforts in the military
were only carried out smoothly,

365
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,079
all thanks to General He.

366
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,199
Now,

367
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,359
those incapable sons of nobility
and the influential have been removed

368
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,199
from their positions.

369
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,680
The military
is filled with capable talents.

370
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,959
A new culture has been implemented
from top to bottom.

371
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,199
It is a major boost in morale.

372
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,599
General He
must be credited for this matter.

373
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,439
Don't give me so much praise.

374
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:01,439
I was merely forced to get on your boat.

375
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,359
Mother.

376
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,280
What did you need me for?

377
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,359
Yi'er.

378
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,920
I got a group of opera performers
to come and perform today.

379
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,359
Watch the opera performance with me.

380
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
I still have work to do.

381
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
You have work every day,

382
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,079
but you don't get
to enjoy the performances every day.

383
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,280
Besides, Yi'er,

384
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,680
how long has it been
since you watched a show with me?

385
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,040
You must watch it with me today.

386
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,280
All right.

387
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,719
I am the newly appointed prefect

388
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,840
(Autumn River)
of Tianquan County, Murong Yuyan.

389
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,560
If you have any grievances,

390
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,319
please do tell me.

391
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,290
(Autumn River)

392
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:04,680
I think the play Wan'er choreographed

393
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,800
is much more interesting
than the ones out there.

394
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,119
As for you.

395
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,520
As for you.

396
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,680
You impersonated a court official.

397
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,400
You deceived His Majesty.
You were disloyal.

398
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,959
You oppressed the people.

399
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,839
You judged a murder case with bias.
That is an injustice.

400
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:25,304
(Autumn River)

401
00:24:25,343 --> 00:24:27,599
I cannot tolerate disloyal

402
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,680
and unrighteous people like you.

403
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,599
This sword is meant

404
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,040
to vanquish the demons in this world.

405
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,839
I will use your blood

406
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,160
to compensate all the wronged souls...

407
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,800
and comfort all...

408
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,239
the sorrowful souls.

409
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,439
Come on. How was my performance?

410
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
It was all right, I guess.

411
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,119
Since you helped me

412
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,959
give the "Collection of Odd Occurrences"
an ending,

413
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,640
when it is reprinted,

414
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,839
I will include your pen name

415
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:22,959
on it too.

416
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,280
Really?

417
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:26,800
I'll have
to think it over properly then.

418
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,959
I must think

419
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,319
of an astounding and unforgettable name!

420
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,160
Speaking of which,

421
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,599
you've read a lot of books
about investigations.

422
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:34,760
Be completely honest.

423
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,400
What do you think
of the "Collection of Odd Occurrences"?

424
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,040
There are a lot of stories
about investigations out there,

425
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
but the "Collection of Odd Occurrences"
is unlike any of them.

426
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,640
It may appear to be
a story of solving cases,

427
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,280
but it is actually a story

428
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,760
about a law enforcer, Murong Yuyan,
and his ambitions and ideals.

429
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,560
When I read this book,

430
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,160
I thought the author

431
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,319
must have had
a burning fire in his heart

432
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,680
that he wanted to use
to shine and light up the world.

433
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,119
I'm not as good as you think I am,

434
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,479
let alone half
as good as the characters I wrote.

435
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,280
I approached the He Family

436
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,800
because I wanted to introduce
political and military changes.

437
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,119
I wanted to marry Qiu Min

438
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,880
because I wanted your father's support.

439
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,640
But my ambitions

440
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,680
dragged your father

441
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,800
and all of the Qiu Family down.

442
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,280
It is as you said.

443
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,880
I caused the suffering of so many.

444
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,439
I only said that
in a momentary lapse of anger.

446
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,000
Why take it to heart?

447
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Nobody is infallible.

448
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,119
Much less you.

449
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,199
I only said those words

450
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,640
because I had nowhere else
to vent the anger in my heart.

451
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,920
If you're still taking the blame

452
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,119
for everything upon yourself,

453
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,719
then you must be too opinionated.

454
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,520
I've never had a peaceful night of sleep

455
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,800
in the six years
I've been at the Firewood Office.

456
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,079
Every night when it's quiet out there,

457
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,280
there is always a voice questioning me

458
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,959
if what I'm doing is right...

459
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:28,599
or wrong.

460
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,599
I don't know about the other things,

461
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,640
but as far as
the Qiu Family is concerned,

462
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,119
you never coerced my father.

463
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:41,479
So you don't have
to feel guilty or blame yourself.

464
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,359
Do you really think so?

465
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,760
What do the sun and moon care

466
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,520
about a few floating clouds?

467
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,640
What are a few setbacks and hardships

468
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,680
when you achieve great things?

469
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,400
You wrote those lines yourself!

470
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,479
How could you forget about them?

471
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:01,160
Liang Yi. We're all ordinary people.

472
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,560
Ordinary people

473
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,560
are not perfect.

474
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,400
But we can do our best

475
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:09,959
and leave no regrets.

476
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:11,760
And that's enough.

477
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,880
So...

478
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,800
Was my performance good?

479
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,400
It was very good.

480
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,640
I knew it.

481
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,479
Greetings, Your Majesty.

482
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,239
General He.

483
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,880
Liu Quan said you had a treasure for me.

484
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,040
What is so precious

485
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,760
that you had to make the trip yourself?

486
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,680
It is indeed a divine item.

487
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,160
I dare not be any less cautious.

488
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,560
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

489
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:07,040
My son acquired this by chance
when he was patrolling the frontier

490
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,079
at the northern borders
he was stationed at.

491
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Such a large Night-luminescent Pearl
is already a rare find,

492
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,079
but what's even more peculiar

493
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,800
is the flying deity

494
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,040
that can be faintly seen in the center

495
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:21,520
and the natural formation around it

496
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,479
that is shaped like clouds.

497
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,359
There are countless
rare treasures in the palace.

498
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,319
There is nothing
His Majesty hasn't seen before.

499
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,280
How did a Night-luminescent Pearl

500
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,239
become a heavenly sign of auspiciousness?

501
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,040
There is a precious pearl
in the Hongzhen Sutra

502
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,119
named Dengxian Pearl.

503
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,920
It is said
that when the immortal, Hongzhen,

504
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,160
was on a pilgrimage
to the northern borders,

505
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,760
he grasped the true meaning
of the five realms of existence.

506
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,479
Finally,
the Empyrean Fairy inducted him,

507
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,920
and he ascended to heaven as a deity.

508
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,400
Before he did,

509
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,880
he used the spiritual energy
of heaven and the earth

510
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,560
to concentrate his years of cultivation
into a pearl of immortality

511
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,599
and left it in the mortal realm.

512
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,000
But there were no records

513
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,119
of what the pearl looked like.

514
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,199
I had Song Jin find a skilled craftsman

515
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,520
and had him refine
the Night-luminescent Pearl.

516
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
To make it appear like

517
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,199
there was a natural formation

518
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,680
of a deity ascending to heaven

519
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,959
that could be faintly seen within it.

520
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,119
General He's eldest son

521
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,079
is stationed at the northern border.

522
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,839
It makes sense
for him to acquire the pearl.

523
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,400
His Majesty reads the Hongzhen Sutra
religiously every day.

524
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,920
Naturally, he would make the connection.

525
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,599
It is written in the Hongzhen Sutra

526
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that the fated person
who obtains this item

527
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,119
will be graced
by the Empyrean Fairy's presence.

528
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,520
She will find a virgin

529
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,119
to use as her vessel
of reincarnation in the mortal realm

530
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,199
to cleanse the pearl of all mundane.

531
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,319
When the Empyrean Fairy
has consecrated the pearl,

532
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,439
praying and offering
to the pearl every day and night

533
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,040
will prolong one's life.

534
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:36,000
As such,

535
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,560
as long as we present His Majesty
with the Dengxian Pearl,

536
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,040
His Majesty will want to search

537
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,680
for the reincarnation
of the Empyrean Fairy.

538
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,400
I thought the matter of auspiciousness
was merely myth and imagination.

539
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,319
But it turns out
the Hongzhen Sect itself is a mystery.

540
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,920
Since ancient times,

541
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,560
those who hold the highest power

542
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
have yearned for longevity

543
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,280
and to rule forever.

544
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
His Majesty is no exception.

545
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,040
The Grand Preceptor
and the Hongzhen Sect are well-favored

546
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,719
because they appealed
to His Majesty's desires.

547
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,800
But the Grand Preceptor
might not be as devout as he seems.

548
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,119
Would he really buy the idea

549
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,160
of the Dengxian Pearl
descending into the mortal realm?

550
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,599
He has no reason not to.

551
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,560
His Majesty is up in years

552
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,520
and plagued by illnesses.

553
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,160
It is inevitable that His Majesty would
doubt the effectiveness of cultivation and alchemy.

554
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,479
With such an auspicious sign
delivered right to his door,

555
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,439
the Grand Preceptor will definitely
make a huge deal out of it

556
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,199
for the Hongzhen Sect's sake.

557
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,920
What joyous news, Your Majesty!

558
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,719
Years of sincerity have finally
moved the immortal, Hongzhen,

559
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,680
and you've been rewarded
with auspiciousness.

560
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,839
According to the Hongzhen Sutra,

561
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,160
the Dengxian Pearl
should appear together

562
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,439
with the Empyrean Fairy.

563
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,959
Precisely.

564
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,599
With the Dengxian Pearl
consecrated by the Empyrean Fairy,

565
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,760
Your Majesty
will surely be in good health

566
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:54,760
and live a long life.

567
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,079
But where is the Empyrean Fairy?

568
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,319
According to the Hongzhen Sutra,

569
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,920
the Empyrean Fairy

570
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,280
will reincarnate
into the body of the purest woman.

571
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,680
This woman must be a virgin,

572
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,680
and she must be untainted
by all impurities.

573
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,040
The Empyrean Fairy
has a water alignment.

574
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,199
So she will appear by the water

575
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,319
dressed in white.

576
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,280
As for the exact location...

577
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,560
Your Majesty.

578
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,520
I have read a fortune.

579
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,599
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

580
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,239
The place mentioned in the note

581
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
will be
where the Empyrean Fairy will appear.

582
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,000
Good.

583
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,359
Greetings, Your Majesty.

584
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,560
Yan.

585
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,520
I have summoned you here

586
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,160
to have you find someone for me.

587
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,239
Imperial Commander Yan.

588
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,079
The matter of the Empyrean Fairy
is a matter of auspiciousness.

589
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,439
It is a matter of great importance.

590
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,280
You may only bring
your most trusted subordinates with you.

591
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,880
You must not reveal
any of this to another.

592
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,680
I will accomplish this task dutifully,
Your Majesty.

593
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,160
Go on.

594
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,439
When will I be able
to find the Empyrean Fairy?

595
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,280
Your Majesty.

596
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,560
You need only
concentrate on your cultivation.

597
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,719
The Empyrean Fairy will surely

598
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,439
sense your sincerity
as long as you are sincere.

599
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:30,959
Truly?

600
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,400
Rest assured.

601
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,560
All right.

602
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,239
Well then, Your Majesty,

603
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,800
I must return
to continue my concoction now.

604
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,479
All right.

605
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,199
Go on.

606
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,119
I shall take my leave now.

607
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,640
Grand Preceptor.

608
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,400
The pearl appeared out of the blue.

609
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,839
There is no Empyrean Fairy whatsoever.

610
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,400
What if His Majesty fails

611
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,119
to find it?

612
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,520
In that case, we'll just tell
His Majesty he was not sincere enough

613
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,479
and comfort him.

614
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,479
What could possibly happen?

615
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,800
So,

616
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,080
we only have to arrange
for the "Empyrean Fairy"

617
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,360
to appear at the location
the Grand Preceptor mentioned,

618
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
and our plan will be a success.

619
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,320
But

620
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,560
based on what you said...

621
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,600
The Grand Preceptor will perform
divination to determine the direction.

622
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,479
How will we find out then?

623
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,919
I have my ways.

624
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,919
The day after tomorrow, you will go
to the Imperial Guards Camp as usual.

625
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,479
Make sure you find out

626
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,399
where Imperial Commander Yan
will be headed.

627
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,000
Understood.

628
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,159
After you complete this task,

629
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,199
I will redeem you.

630
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,879
Go and find someone suitable,

631
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,320
and settle down.

632
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,679
My lord.

633
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,560
Do you no longer require my services?

634
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,040
The Firewood Office has been faring well
over the past few years.

635
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,520
His Majesty favors me as well.

636
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,000
You've worked hard
for the past few years.

637
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,800
It's time for you to live peaceful days

638
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,000
in comfort and bliss.

639
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,560
You are lying, my lord.

640
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,959
Under the current rule of Yuan Lang,
the Main Administrative Office

641
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,159
is eying you
like a tiger watching its prey.

642
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,399
But you want me to leave
the Royal Academy at a time like this?

643
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,919
You are
the Firewood Office's best informant.

644
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,120
If you get any other ideas,

645
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,760
it would be dangerous for you.

646
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,959
So you still found out.

647
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,520
So...

648
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:01,479
I can no longer
even be Your lordship's informant.

649
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,919
You and I met when we were less eminent.

650
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
We have known
each other for three years.

651
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,040
But that cannot be compared
to the three months you've known her.

652
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,879
What do you mean?

653
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,399
You like Qiu Yan,

654
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,000
don't you?

655
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,439
If you don't want to take this job,

656
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,199
it's all right.

657
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,399
I'll think of something else.

658
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,040
But no matter what,

659
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,520
I will help

660
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:43,959
to redeem you.

661
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,639
No.

662
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,159
I will accomplish every task

663
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,439
you ask of me.

664
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,040
Please do not

665
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,199
help to redeem me as well.

666
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,159
I have been here for three years.

667
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,159
The Royal Academy is my home now.

668
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,280
I will bring some refreshments for you.

669
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,320
Men.

670
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,439
I am in a good mood today.

671
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,679
Drink to your heart's content!

672
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,639
Drink!

673
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,040
Congratulations, Imperial Commander.

674
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,000
It's a joyous occasion for all!

675
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,040
Drink!

676
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,919
Raise your cups!

677
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,399
Drink as much as you like.

678
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:18,520
Good wine.

679
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,040
Drink more then.

680
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,000
Give me another.

681
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,120
Fill it up.

682
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:27,800
Here.

683
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,320
You drink some too.

684
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,360
Come! Drink!

685
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,879
Miss Xiaoxiao.

686
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:38,520
I just love your cold as ice demeanor.

687
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,800
Before you,

688
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,280
even a shiver would numb my entire body.

689
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:49,479
I wonder, what has you

690
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,520
in such a good mood today,
Imperial Commander Yan?

691
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,040
Me?

692
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,040
I'll be honest with you.

693
00:38:57,879 --> 00:39:00,520
I got an important mission today.

694
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:03,239
One like never before.

695
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,000
If I complete it,

696
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,199
a great reward

697
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,239
will await me!

698
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:12,760
What mission
would merit such a great reward?

699
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Finding someone.

700
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,199
Who?

701
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,159
I must abide by military discipline.

702
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,000
I can't tell anyone that.

703
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,840
Not even me,

704
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:33,040
Imperial Commander Yan?

705
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,919
Well, if Miss Xiaoxiao wants to know,

706
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,239
I could perhaps make an exception.

707
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,080
All right.

708
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:53,360
Sir!

709
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,639
This is the information
we received from our...

710
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,840
Information we got
from Imperial Commander Yan.

711
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,812
(Luggage, one straw raincoat,
one pair of wooden clogs to wade)

712
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,520
Didn't you say your informant

713
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,360
would be able to get us information
about the direction to go?

714
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,439
This is just a list of items.

715
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Imperial Commander Yan has held
His Majesty's trust for many years.

716
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,360
I guess we won't be able
to get it out from him.

717
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,719
She could only write us

718
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,840
about what she saw.

719
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,399
I understand now.

720
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:31,639
Based on the items
prepared for tomorrow's departure,

721
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,399
we might be able to tell
which direction they will go.

722
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,719
The Hongzhen Sutra says

723
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,479
that the Empyrean Fairy
will appear at places with water.

724
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,959
There are not
many water sources in the capital.

725
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,159
We only need to figure out
the general direction,

726
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,360
and we'll be able to identify
where the Empyrean Fairy will show up.

727
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:47,679
One would bring a raincoat
to avoid getting wet.

728
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,639
But it's the middle of summer right now.

729
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,439
There hasn't been
a drop of rain in days.

730
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,959
Where would there be rain?

731
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,199
The Huilong Mountain in the west
has a unique topography.

732
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,040
There are often
rain showers in that area.

733
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,040
Is there a water source
around that area?

734
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:57,760
Yes.

735
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,520
The Jinxian Spring.

736
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,239
But this Jinxian Spring
extends for tens of lis.

737
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:02,320
The range is far too wide.

738
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,160
(Jinxian Spring)

739
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,040
They will need wooden clogs.

740
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,639
That means they must need
to pass through shallow waters.

741
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,959
It's a place
where you would need to wade.

742
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,679
That must be upstream, then.
Around the spring cave.

743
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,959
The water is shallow,
and you will need to wade through it.

744
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:20,520
Song Jin.

745
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,679
This place.

746
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,340
(Luggage, one straw raincoat,
one pair of wooden clogs to wade, Jinxian Spring)

747
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,159
Have you memorized it?

748
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,439
Tomorrow, follow the marked location

749
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,520
and bring our "Empyrean Fairy"
to wait for them there.

750
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,439
Understood.

751
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,840
Let's go and see them.

752
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,280
Let's go.

753
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,159
Qiu... Qiu Mei...

754
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,520
I... Qiu Mei...

755
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,360
I, Qiu Mei, greet His Majesty.

756
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,040
Are you the daughter
of the criminal, Qiu Yi?

757
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,800
Aren't all of you supposed to be dead?

758
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:52,679
Yes.

759
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,760
No! That's not it.

760
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,040
Yes. We... The Qiu Family...

761
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,239
The Qiu Family encountered an accident
while we were on Bian River.

762
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,360
Then...

763
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,520
Then...

764
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,719
After that...

765
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,040
Qiu Mei.

766
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,199
We are all

767
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,520
counting on you.

768
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,000
But you're a nervous mess!

769
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,000
My daughter

770
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,760
has never told a single lie
her entire life.

771
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,360
Asking her to lie before His Majesty

772
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,479
at the Hall of Supreme Harmony

773
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,280
is an impossible task for her.

774
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,760
Mother.

775
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,520
I had it all memorized.

776
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,080
But

777
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,399
when she yelled at me just now,

778
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,040
I...

779
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,760
I forgot everything.
I couldn't recall anything!

780
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,080
Qiu Ying.

781
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:29,199
You're a brave one.

782
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,679
Why don't you
take her place instead tomorrow?

783
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,520
I'm scared.

784
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:33,239
I can't do it.

785
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,320
Qiu Mei had been
memorizing those lines for so long,

786
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,159
yet she still couldn't memorize them.

787
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,360
How could I memorize them
in just one night?

788
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:43,800
I'll go.

789
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,000
I've been listening
when Qiu Mei was memorizing her lines.

790
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,520
I've already memorized the lines.

791
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,280
Qiu Mei is doing this to save Father.

792
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,919
This is a crucial matter
for the Qiu Family.

793
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,360
As Father's legitimate daughter,

794
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,719
I have a duty
to serve my family as well.

795
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,399
You can't.

796
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,239
Why?

797
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,320
You've always been
timid and weak-willed.

798
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,520
You are not fit for the task.

799
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:02,679
Min'er.

800
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,639
You've always been sheltered,

801
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,719
and you have frail health.

802
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:07,560
You shouldn't
involve yourself in this matter.

803
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,040
Qiu Yan.

804
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:25,040
Look.

805
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,280
If this plan succeeds,

806
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,520
then it would be
a joyous occasion for all.

807
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,959
But if it doesn't,

808
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,399
then we would have committed
the crime of deceiving His Majesty.

809
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,560
That's right.

810
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,560
Our men have only been exiled.

811
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,239
Life may be hard
for us at the Guangji Hall,

812
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,360
but it's better than having
the entire family sentenced to death.

813
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,239
That's right.

814
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:43,479
If we fail, we might lose our heads.

815
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,080
Qiu Yan, you are not afraid of death,

816
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:47,040
but I am.

817
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,719
We are all women.

818
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,000
Even the men in our family
are of no use now.

819
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:52,199
Will we women

820
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,399
be able to do it?

821
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:54,080
If you ask me,

822
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:55,639
I think we shouldn't take the risk.

823
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:01,399
Yan'er.

824
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,479
Just be good and stay
at the Marquis's residence as Madam Su.

825
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:08,320
Just send us some money now and then.

826
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,040
That'll be enough to take care of us.
