And participate in this program

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,960
What about the theme of our program

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,320
Is

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,080
Meet people who don't like themselves

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,120
What to cook

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,440
Close the distance

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,680
Dislike

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
Because I don't understand

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Don't understand

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,080
Often because you don't like it

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,040
And don't want to know

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,960
This brewed bitter gourd

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,240
Seeding, pickling and cutting

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,040
Mix stuffing and brew

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,800
Let people know the bitter taste

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,920
It can also be delicious

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,240
People you don't like

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,600
There is also a lovely side

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,720
Right

22
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,040
We are

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
"What to eat next" company

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,320
That's right, that's right

25
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,720
Right, right, right

26
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,600
That's what I told you last time

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,640
Okay, that's it first. Thank you

28
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,040
Right

29
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,440
Programs attended by Mr. Yu

30
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,240
It's already online

31
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,600
Post in 30 minutes

32
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,840
Is the content of the draft all right

33
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
OK, thank you

34
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,680
Hey, hurry up

35
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,560
I heard that the Great Devil

36
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,520
I'll be back in a minute

37
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,120
Don't let him bump into it

38
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,720
We cook

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Public relations, that's firing and cooking

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
That girl's name is Su Kelan

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,440
Do not like to work overtime

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,520
But sometimes

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,360
Everyone works overtime

44
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,200
She'll take her, too

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,160
That health pot comes out

46
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,880
Make some overtime meals for everyone

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,240
The company atmosphere is really good

48
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,160
Sure enough, our Yu Zong

49
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Is a good boss

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,440
Walk young people

51
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,200
Before frying

52
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,480
Will put it in hot water first

53
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,240
Go through it first

54
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,680
After a while

55
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,400
Actually, it can be a little

56
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,720
This is my boss

57
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,520
Yu Hao

58
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,520
People who don't know him

59
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
Think he is perfect

60
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Strong and warm

61
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,600
But actually

62
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,080
He is a true bitter gourd

63
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,840
Even with nutrition

64
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,480
But it's too bitter to eat

65
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,160
Yu Zong

66
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,120
Tomorrow at three o'clock in the afternoon

67
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
There is a program interview

68
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,720
Will you participate

69
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,600
Control it within twenty minutes

70
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,160
In addition

71
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,920
The program group feels that

72
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,080
The matter of using body double

73
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,920
Communicate with the program group

74
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,720
It's your job

75
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,840
What happened to the media manuscript

76
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,000
Have I ever said this kind of nonsense

77
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Who wrote it

78
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
Guo Yu

79
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,600
It was last week

80
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,560
The one who is late every day

81
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,600
Why haven't you been fired yet

82
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,920
Yu Zonghao

83
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,600
Yu Zonghao

84
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
Which department

85
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,320
I'm from the public relations department

86
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,800
My name is Guo Yu

87
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,240
What do you think of my participation

88
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,120
"Have a good meal with you"

89
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
This program

90
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,520
Our application

91
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,080
Mainly

92
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
Deliver fresh and semi-finished products

93
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,960
For people who love food

94
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,320
Like Yu Zong

95
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,720
Good image and good temperament

96
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,480
And love food

97
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
Love your family

98
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,520
The cooking is delicious

99
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
Don't you know I can't cook

100
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,160
What do you think I can't cook

101
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
It is also set up by people with exquisite cooking skills

102
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,400
Participate

103
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,120
"Have a good meal with you"

104
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,680
This program

105
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,960
Can I always cook

106
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Not important

107
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,320
You said

108
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Please traffic star

109
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
Endorse company products

110
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,920
Even if it can bring benefits

111
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,960
But it is short-term

112
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,040
It will cost millions of dollars

113
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
Yu Zong has a good image and temperament

114
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,840
The fan base is solid

115
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,920
And with the company brand is

116
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Connect in one body

117
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,920
Long-term stability

118
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,680
But if you learn to cook for this

119
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
It takes too long

120
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,920
Delay the rest of the total business time

121
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,600
The program is just for effect

122
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,120
There is no need to waste time

123
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,360
Accurate analysis of the market

124
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
And user psychology

125
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
Provide brand benefits

126
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,880
Maximized public relations scheme

127
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
To the image of me and the company

128
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,880
Carry out marketing

129
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,520
It is the responsibility of your public relations department

130
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,480
And you

131
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
I can only say that kind of nonsense just now

132
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
Do you think you are competent

133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
Go to the personnel department by yourself tomorrow

134
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Yu Zonghao

135
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,880
Yu Zong is here

136
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Here comes the boss

137
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,440
Colan tidy up

138
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,920
Yu Zong

139
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Even eat

140
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
It is also considered to be a time waster

141
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Be called the devil by the office

142
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
Probably as long as it is

143
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
People who know him well

144
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,400
No one will like him

145
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
Are you off duty

146
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,840
Why don't you go back first

147
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,080
The devil is back

148
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,320
You can't cook in front of him

149
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
We order takeout by ourselves

150
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Don't worry

151
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,600
I thought Yu was always a warm man

152
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,640
Just came to work here

153
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
I didn't expect it to be the devil

154
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,600
Overtime all day

155
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,680
I don't even dare to eat a good meal

156
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
All right, stop it

157
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,880
Watch the program

158
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
Add more barrage

159
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,760
Hungry in the middle of the night

160
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
Mr. Yu, are you short of a girlfriend

161
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,320
The kind that can eat very well

162
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
When it comes to cooking, it's all close-ups

163
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,960
It's body double, right

164
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,920
Look at my Weibo

165
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,480
There is a comparison chart

166
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,280
How did this happen

167
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,720
Colan

168
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,000
What's the matter

169
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,280
Sure enough, if you have money, you will

170
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,360
You can do whatever you want

171
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
True capital comes to an end

172
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,720
Watch the fun and watch the fun

173
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,400
A boss who can't cook

174
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,920
I also advised others to eat well

175
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Cooking scenes are said to be

176
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,680
It was done with body double

177
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,960
Body double is used to do programs

178
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,480
You can't cook at all, can you

179
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,760
Everything on the show is fake

180
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
Excessive

181
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,280
To be on the show

182
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
Just learn it yourself

183
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,840
Boycott

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
I didn't know at that time

185
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm about to enter the devil's kitchen

186
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,200
Strive to bring bitter gourd

187
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,880
Make a good taste

188
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,360
What about after our company

189
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,320
Will be specially released for this

190
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,960
That's a good statement

191
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,880
Please trust us

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,040
It's all rumors

193
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,640
Right

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
When I trouble you to report,

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't use the word body double, okay

196
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,760
We Yu Zong

197
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,040
It really doesn't use body double

198
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,200
Hello

199
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,720
Hello

200
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,000
Um yeah

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,120
"What to Eat" Public Relations Department

202
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
OK, thank you

203
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Right, right, right

204
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,880
Yu is always really useless, body double

205
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,640
Yes yes yes

206
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,480
Specific caliber

207
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,160
We'll be later

208
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,280
Will communicate with the media

209
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,680
Thank you

210
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,880
So what you're giving

211
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,600
Solutions

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,520
A statement

213
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Second control evaluation

214
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,920
Third, abandon body double

215
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Learn to cook

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,520
Jing Chen

217
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,920
You said in the elevator this afternoon

218
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,200
I learn to cook

219
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,000
There is no cost performance

220
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
It seems that this time it is really

221
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,000
You can't do it without learning

222
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
Things are different now

223
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,440
The matter of using body double has been fermented

224
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,160
If not in time

225
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,840
Fifty minutes

226
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
Thirty-seven minutes

227
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Eight minutes

228
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,680
Previous program group

229
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,560
Encounter an emergency

230
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
You communicate with the program group

231
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,360
The fastest time to get out of the plan

232
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240
It's fifty minutes

233
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,680
You were lazy before

234
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,640
Or this time

235
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,680
It's really a special situation

236
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
Spend money on hot search

237
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,760
Stir-fry the topic from putting materials

238
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,640
Then go to the hot search

239
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
How long does it usually take

240
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,480
One hour

241
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
This time from the first barrage

242
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,160
Start a hot search on the Internet

243
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,080
Eight minutes

244
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,440
How

245
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,920
Discuss with the program group

246
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,440
It makes me ride a tiger

247
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
Forced me to learn to cook, didn't you

248
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,360
Yu Zong

249
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,440
How about we do this

250
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
It's also for the good of the company

251
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,520
If you

252
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,480
Cooperate with the program group a little

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,760
It won't be

254
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,600
So it's the program group

255
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,840
Will you be paid

256
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,360
Yu Zong

257
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,560
We have stood on the ground

258
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,160
Company position

259
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,440
Try my best to communicate

260
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,520
But the program group made it very clear

261
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,840
A food column

262
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
Use a body double

263
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,320
I have advised you many times

264
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,760
Either you abandon body double

265
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
Cook your own food

266
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
Or what

267
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Your work

268
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,400
Is to communicate with the program group

269
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,720
Instead of setting up a bureau

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,120
To force your boss

271
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,480
This ability to work

272
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,200
None of them

273
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,080
Yeah

274
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,520
I can't go back to working overtime

275
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,760
It's nothing right now

276
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,400
But I just can't go

277
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,800
Bye bye

278
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,440
Hello

279
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,040
You take the baby to eat first

280
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
I can't go back today

281
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,240
I can't go back

282
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,800
You guys eat first

283
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
It's all like this

284
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,600
Are you still in the mood to cook

285
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,040
Have a good meal

286
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
To be in the mood to work hard

287
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,520
Stir-fry a slice of garlic

288
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,840
Add ginger

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,080
Stir-fry chopped green onion and small pepper

290
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Put luncheon meat

291
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,680
Stir-fry tofu until golden brown

292
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,320
Add pepper and star anise

293
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,840
Pour old smoke

294
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,520
Soy sauce cooking wine

295
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,280
Add soup to boil

296
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Simple pot

297
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
Health pot for office use

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,160
It can be finished in three minutes

299
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,040
Be careful of burning

300
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,520
Sister Kelan, I'll have a taste, too

301
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,640
Be careful of burning

302
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Well, it's delicious

303
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
Sister Kelan, I want it too

304
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,840
I want it, too

305
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,360
Yao Qian

306
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,000
Why don't you share it with everyone

307
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,040
Thank you, sister Kelan

308
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,680
Sister Xie Kelan

309
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,000
There is also food here

310
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,440
Uh-huh

311
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,160
It smells good

312
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,280
Can you give us some

313
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,360
Can you give us some

314
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,840
Go

315
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,840
We don't have enough to eat yet

316
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,400
There is my braised pork in the refrigerator

317
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
OK, thank you

318
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,920
But don't move that fish ball

319
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,800
That's what she did

320
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,720
Feed the stray cats downstairs

321
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,280
OK

322
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll get a pair of chopsticks, too

323
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Social animals are only available in

324
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
When eating

325
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,680
Will feel that you

326
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Is alive

327
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,760
Sister Kelan

328
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
Don't you eat together

329
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,400
I can't

330
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,080
I went home to dinner with my mother

331
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,280
Sister Kelan

332
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,160
You're just because

333
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,840
I have to eat with my mother

334
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,760
I always don't work overtime

335
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,120
Why bother

336
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,640
I think with your ability

337
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Be willing to work overtime

338
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
I would have been promoted and raised a long time ago

339
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,800
I prefer to be idle

340
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,320
So I can have more time

341
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,240
Stay with my mother

342
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,400
You can also have more time

343
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Make food for everyone

344
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,760
Thank you, sister Kelan

345
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,480
For me,

346
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Work is to survive

347
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,800
And life

348
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,560
It's with the people I love

349
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,160
Share three meals a day

350
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,480
And those in their leisure time

351
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
Warm and happy

352
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,240
Survival

353
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Survival should not be squeezed out

354
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,040
Living space

355
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm Su Kelan

356
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,400
A salted fish that doesn't like to work overtime

357
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,360
Colan

358
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,680
Why don't you go back first

359
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,880
Auntie should wait for hunger

360
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,600
It's so late

361
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,200
But here

362
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,240
One more than you, one less than you

363
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,320
How much difference can you make

364
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,640
Let's go

365
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,320
Good

366
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,160
Then I'll go home

367
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,200
Have dinner with my mother

368
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,880
I'll come back

369
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,400
Mr. Jing, they have a plan

370
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,880
It is said that as long as Yu Zong

371
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Cooperate with the next program

372
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,480
Use one's body

373
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,400
The program group will cooperate

374
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,240
Say this time

375
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,560
He hurt his hand

376
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,920
I think

377
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,320
May not be persuaded

378
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,240
Why

379
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,480
What's the matter

380
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,440
Hot search

381
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,120
Don't you think

382
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,360
Are you going up too fast

383
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Go up so fast

384
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,400
It should be designed

385
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Designed

386
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,280
Are you saying

387
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,320
Does the devil know

388
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,120
I can see it all

389
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,960
What do you say

390
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,960
The Great Devil certainly doesn't like it

391
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,120
Others set him up

392
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,280
I can't stand it

393
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
I resign

394
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,520
Resign

395
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,200
Right

396
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,640
You think

397
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,440
This world

398
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,960
Is it all around you

399
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,200
My ability to work

400
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,040
It's less than one

401
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,920
Self-righteous

402
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,600
Blindly confident people to judge

403
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,560
I quit my job, too

404
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,160
I quit my job, too

405
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,680
I don't believe it

406
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
Someone will clean up for you

407
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
This shit

408
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,760
Yu Zong

409
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,080
Let you find all the people in the public relations department

410
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,760
Is everyone here

411
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,440
Here we are

412
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,880
Who did it

413
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,640
I

414
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,400
Today's company

415
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,280
This happens

416
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,560
You're still cooking here

417
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,480
The company lets you come to eat

418
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Or let you work

419
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,960
For

420
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,200
Work better

421
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,320
Fill one's stomach

422
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,800
Cook in the company

423
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,960
Save going downstairs to find food

424
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
Time to wait for food

425
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,760
You can have more energy

426
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
Focus on work

427
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,080
Isn't it faster to order takeout

428
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,320
Immerse yourself in the take-out software

429
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,600
It may be difficult to decide what to eat

430
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,880
Waiting time is also easy to be distracted

431
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,000
So

432
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,240
I did it directly

433
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
More efficient

434
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,960
Yu Zong

435
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,880
What are the jobs below

436
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,920
Do you want to assign

437
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
You guys inside

438
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,920
Who has been in the company for the longest time

439
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,080
In the last program,

440
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,480
Who drew up the copy of eating bitter gourd

441
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,520
Dislike

442
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,640
Because I don't understand

443
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,000
Without understanding

444
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,960
Often because you don't like it

445
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
And don't want to know

446
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,960
Who drew it up

447
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,160
Name

448
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,440
Su Kelan

449
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,000
I like delicious food

450
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,360
Yes

451
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,080
Understand

452
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,480
"Have a good meal with you"

453
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,520
Not bad

454
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,440
Starting today

455
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,600
Your promotion to director

456
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,680
The salary is twice that of the former director

457
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,600
Do a lot and double the bonus

458
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,360
Sometimes don't put

459
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,520
It's too important to think about yourself

460
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,520
The company left you

461
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,440
As long as I'm here

462
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,280
Referral

463
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,360
Come to my office

464
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,200
Yu Zong

465
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
Is the new version planning meeting still open

466
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,320
Why don't you open it

467
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
Do you want to give priority to it

468
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
What do you mean

469
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,000
Public relations issues

470
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
More important than product issues

471
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,920
It's just a small broken program group as a demon

472
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,800
It's not worth wasting at all

473
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,480
My time

474
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,000
You tell the product team

475
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,960
Tell them to wait for me in the conference room

476
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll be there in three minutes

477
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,640
Good

478
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,080
Sue, what was it again

479
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,440
Su Kelan

480
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,160
This is your public relations department

481
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,840
A plan made

482
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,120
Surplus

483
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,480
Page 5, Article 6

484
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,280
Turn around

485
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,560
I need you to go at once

486
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,520
Communicate with the program group

487
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,360
Tell them to cancel

488
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,920
Previous communication results with Jing Chen

489
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,320
They set up a bureau

490
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Just trying to force me to learn to cook

491
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,920
But this is absolutely impossible

492
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,880
The matter of personnel transfer

493
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,280
Angie has

494
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,240
Notify the program group

495
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,720
You go back and look for it

496
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,600
They can communicate

497
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,320
Before nine o'clock in the evening

498
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,560
Give me a telegram report

499
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,680
Does that mean nine o'clock tonight

500
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,920
But it's already off duty

501
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,800
Are you financially free

502
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,280
Without financial freedom

503
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
Talking about commuting time

504
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,120
From now on

505
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,880
Your mobile phone is turned on 24 hours a day

506
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,120
This is to get this salary

507
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,280
The most basic conditions

508
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,680
If you can't do it

509
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,600
Just leave

510
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
Someone else will do it

511
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,920
This time, let you be right

512
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,760
Communication of program group

513
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
Think of it as your positive investigation

514
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
Do you remember what time I want you to call me back

515
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,840
Nine o'clock

516
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,320
Yu Zong

517
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,440
Can I do it tomorrow

518
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I'll report back to you

519
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,160
I can't get your report before nine o'clock

520
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
Go to the personnel department by yourself tomorrow

521
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,760
Yu Zong

522
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,440
Sit down

523
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,040
Let's get started

524
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,520
Good

525
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,800
To open

526
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,040
The new version has been adjusted

527
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,080
The following failures

528
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,880
First of all, for this

529
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,680
User experience

530
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,040
The coupon problem

531
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,560
We set up a kind of

532
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,800
Coupon exclusive to new members

533
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,600
What happened

534
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,080
Nothing

535
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,480
How do you do

536
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,520
The number you dialed

537
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
Is on the phone

538
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,240
Please redial later

539
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,520
Good director

540
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,160
I am

541
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,800
Su Kelan of What to Eat next

542
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,240
How do you do

543
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
The number you dialed

544
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,720
Is on the phone

545
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,000
Please redial later

Guide

547
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Don't talk at all

548
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,360
It's not so good, is it

549
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,080
Yu Hao, a bastard

550
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
Take Jingchen and all three of them out

551
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,200
Substitution

552
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,520
Change the ghost

553
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,720
Keren is a sponsor after all

554
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
What happened to the sponsor

555
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,480
One by one, you

556
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,720
What are you doing sitting there

557
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,200
Lele

558
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,360
Go and put that

559
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,960
"What to eat" materials

560
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,080
Change me to "love freshness"

561
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,800
Get it

562
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,400
This is to change sponsors

563
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,720
What about liquidated damages

564
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,040
They are willing to give

565
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,400
Just waiting for us to sign the contract

566
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,680
Yu Haona made trouble

567
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,360
What to do

568
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:36,880
Right

569
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,080
Make trouble with the hammer

570
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,520
Use a body double

571
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
All kinds of uncooperative black materials

572
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,000
It's all in our hands

573
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,320
Make a fuss about people's designs made with money

574
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,080
It just collapsed

575
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,120
You let him make trouble

576
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,280
You'll see

577
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,040
People who die like Yu Hao

578
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,840
How many people are there now

579
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,000
Waiting to see him fall

580
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,760
Mom

581
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,400
It's okay. I'm not tired

582
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,080
Now work hard and hard

583
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,160
Make more money

584
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,840
Only in the future

585
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,160
Spend more time with you

586
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,000
Then don't earn this overtime money now

587
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
You'll have time right away

588
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
How can it be so easy

589
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,320
Do you work overtime or not

590
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm not in charge either

591
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,160
And don't work overtime

592
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,520
How to make money to see you

593
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,920
Mom

594
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,520
I ordered you takeout

595
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,440
Remember to get an injection before you eat

596
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,360
Got it

597
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,120
Okay, I gotta go

598
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,960
Say no overtime

599
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,320
When the boss talks about promotion,

600
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,200
Fart Dian fart Dian added

601
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,120
Schema

602
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,440
What are you talking about

603
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,880
Has been caught by the boss

604
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,440
I won't do it if I can still say it

605
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Don't I work overtime

606
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,160
That's not watching people serve dishes

607
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,360
We usually let her add

608
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,240
Did she add it

609
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,440
Say what mother should take care of when she is sick

610
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,280
Mother can not work overtime if she is sick

611
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,400
It's not like it's going to be gone soon

612
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,400
Why do you still curse people's mothers

613
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
Keep your mouth clean

614
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,240
Yao Qian

615
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,600
What you're eating now

616
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,440
Or did people do it

617
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,800
Don't eat if you have the ability to break your mouth

618
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,640
Have no conscience

619
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,120
Besides

620
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
She just doesn't like it

621
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,360
Work overtime in the company

622
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,240
People in the middle of the night

623
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:31,840
Help you at home

624
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
How many things have you done

625
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,640
Don't remember

626
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
Speech of the Great Devil

627
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
None of you can draw it up

628
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,880
Or someone else did it

629
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,360
I don't even remember it again

630
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,520
Hello

631
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,360
Oh yeah

632
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,640
Who doesn't know they are best friends

633
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,920
And ah

634
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,360
Just live upstairs and downstairs

635
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,800
And ah

636
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,080
I also heard that her parents often go there

637
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
Colan eats at home

638
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,840
Cannibalism has a short mouth

639
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
I can't see anyone talking about her

640
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,840
Wan Shun

641
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,440
Come

642
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,760
Brought you fish balls

643
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,800
Eat it

644
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,480
Come

645
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,880
Let's go eat hot pot later

646
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,960
Ask your boyfriend to join you

647
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,080
OK, I've been wanting to eat for a long time

648
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,640
Let's go

649
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,200
This hairy belly is very delicious

650
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,760
Let me tell you something

651
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,680
And his duck intestines

652
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,480
Extremely fresh

653
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,320
Why work hard

654
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,680
Because I want to have

655
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,360
Life outside of work

656
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,280
The harder you work, the harder you work

657
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,560
The less time you have to live

658
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,520
Hello

659
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,120
I heard something happened at headquarters

660
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,800
Three executives were opened in a row

661
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,680
You have been promoted to director

662
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,160
Maybe it will be opened at nine o'clock

663
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,880
Ha ha

664
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,560
I'm sorry

665
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,400
You have so many things today

666
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm still working overtime and can't make it back

667
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
Why don't you apply for a transfer back

668
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,880
The company doesn't let the office fall in love

669
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,320
In case they are found

670
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,080
Trouble

671
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,440
And Chengdu and Chongqing are so close

672
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Every weekend

673
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,720
Can't I come back, too

674
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,600
Did you have dinner together

675
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,800
I want to eat together every day

676
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,360
Then I'll change my name to Tiantian

677
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,720
It's too cold

678
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,440
Love you every day

679
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,680
Hello

680
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,040
Express delivery, right

681
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,040
Send it to 3207 for me

682
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,120

683
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,080
Guide

684
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,080
Aren't you tired

685
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,880
Tired

686
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,360
As a person

687
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,480
The director of food programs

688
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,320
How can you feel tired of cooking

689
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,760
That's refreshing

690
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,560
Do you know

691
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,280
Doesn't anyone think

692
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,680
Hold the handle of the pot in one hand

693
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,480
The other hand holds a spatula

694
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,120
Stir-fry

695
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,840
There is a kind of

696
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,200
The feeling of reigning in the world

697
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,000
Jin Dao's Express Delivery

698
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,640
Yeah

699
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,160
There he is

700
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,120
Thank you

701
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,280
How do you do

702
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,920
Excuse me, is this director Jin Xuan

703
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,000
Express delivery

704
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,640
Female

705
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,360
Teachers have worked hard

706
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I'm Su Kelan

707
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,960
"What to eat next?" Public relations department

708
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,880
A new person in charge

709
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,720
Here comes the express delivery for everyone

710
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,160
Wait a minute

711
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,200
You made that call just now

712
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,240
But there's a man on the phone

713
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,720
It's like this

714
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
The courier brother helped make a phone call

715
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,080
And borrowed this dress from me

716
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,120
I said

717
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,720
It's my friend's birthday

718
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,160
Wanted to surprise him

719
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,520
Golden Autumn Crab Fertilizer

720
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,080
I sent you some

721
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,160
Steamed stuffed bun with crab roe

722
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,400
His family uses crabs from Yangcheng Lake

723
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,200
Three crab peeling masters started by hand

724
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,720
One day can only be at most

725
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,760
Peel two hundred crabs

726
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,040
Steamed 50 cages of steamed buns

727
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
This is just 15 minutes

728
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,720
Less unfamiliar

729
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,160
More steamed buns turn yellow

730
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,680
Everybody try it

731
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,720
You are welcome

732
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,040
Jin Dao

733
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,080
Try it, too

734
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,200
I'm not eating this

735
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,600
I've already found a sponsor

736
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,080
You tell Yu Hao

737
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,280
Don't send someone to talk again

738
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,080
Guide

739
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,680
Or

740
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,120
Would you like to have a look at this first

741
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,320
After reading it,

742
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,160
If you still insist

743
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,280
I'll leave at once

744
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,040
This is the basic situation

745
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,800
Just follow this plan

746
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,480
Ensure progress

747
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,160
Good

748
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,040
Brother

749
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Our plan is so easy

750
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,320
It passed

751
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,240
You're new here

752
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,840
Mr. Yu did not give a negative opinion

753
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,120
It means high praise

754
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,840
Your whole group saw the quarterly bonus

755
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,840
Will laugh more happily

756
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,440
Really

757
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,000
I thought Yu was always very

758
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,400
Mean

759
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,680
That's just people who are not satisfied with him

760
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,480
Just mean

761
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
People who are satisfied with him

762
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,560
It's just that the face looks mean

763
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
It's still easy to get along with

764
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
These personnel changes

765
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,840
It won't be bad for the company

766
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Institutional structure

767
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,880
Yu Zong

768
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,800
Boss

769
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,000
That's not the public relations department

770
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,720
Nasukelan

771
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,840
Do you make it to feed the cat

772
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,040
Yu Zong

773
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
Xiao Guo, who you are going to quit in the morning

774
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,560
It is more difficult at home

775
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
His father is ill

776
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
Is the company a charity

777
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,040
Who told you to run around the basement

778
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,240
You don't know, running around the basement

779
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,000
Is it dangerous

780
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,120
What if it hurts

781
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,520
I'm very serious now

782
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,200
I'm warning you

783
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,400
If you run around the basement again,

784
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,760
Go by yourself tomorrow

785
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,640
There will be no delicious food tomorrow

786
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,560
Remember

787
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,640
Go ahead

788
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,000
You put the man's

789
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,440
Send me all performance and weekly reports

790
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,280
Good Yu Zong

791
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,600
Yu Zong

792
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,640
I'm sorry about what happened before

793
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,360
Could you please

794
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,560
Give me another chance

795
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,520
My father is ill in hospital

796
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,040
My family has to pay back the loan

797
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,840
I really need this job

798
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,640
Can you not fire me

799
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,560
Yu Zong

800
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,840
Your private affairs

801
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,280
What does it have to do with the company

802
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,120
Yu Hao

803
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,600
Unexpected

804
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,560
Yu Hao also has today

805
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Peng Xiao

806
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,000
To apologize to Yu Hao, the grandson

807
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,920
Read it again

808
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,400
Good

809
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
I thought about it well

810
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,320
Sometimes

811
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,320
I am too self-centered

812
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,240
Where are you?

813
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,360
I give people around me who cooperate

814
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Have caused a lot of trouble

815
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,520
What trouble

816
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,400
Oh, it's about body double

817
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,840
I hope

818
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,960
Can you tell the program group for me

819
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,320
Send an apology

820
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,280
This apology

821
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,080
I still need someone else to convey it

822
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
From understanding mistakes

823
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,240
To admit your mistakes

824
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,920
It will take a little time

825
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,880
In the subsequent program recording,

826
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,320
I must

827
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,240
Coordinate with the arrangement of the program group

828
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,040
That's wonderful

829
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,360
It's awesome. It's awesome

830
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,320
It's awesome. It's awesome

831
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,520
Yes

832
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,640
Right

833
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,680
You do as I say

834
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,280
Just do it

835
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,800
I gave you the content

836
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,120
Hurry up

837
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,960
You are too daring, aren't you

838
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,800
Forging imperial edicts

839
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,960
Program Group and Yu Hao

840
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,120
At loggerheads

841
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,600
I can't talk calmly at all

842
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,960
I'll do it this way

843
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,080
At least eliminate it first

844
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,120
The anger of the program group

845
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,880
Willing to talk more

846
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,440
But you're replacing the devil

847
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,520
Be soft and apologize

848
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm telling you

849
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,000
It was really discovered

850
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,080
We're screwed together

851
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,840
Jin Dao

852
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,160
You also know our total

853
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,640
He can do this step

854
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
It's already a great deal of sincerity

855
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,560
Apologizing is just lip service

856
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,760
I don't want the show

857
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,640
Become his showground

858
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,440
This is not my original intention

859
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,000
But

860
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,760
You're nice

861
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm also quite good at doing things

862
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,800
But

863
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,240
There is no need to suffer indignities in Yu Hao

864
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,200
All right

865
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,880
I'll cook for everyone

866
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,480
Jin Dao

867
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,440
Why don't I give it to everyone

868
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,320
Cook and eat

869
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,400
You

870
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,560
Yeah

871
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,440
We Yu Zong have been reflecting

872
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,840
Think he is interested in food

873
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,080
And the program group does not respect

874
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,480
So I want to pass through me

875
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,600
To communicate with the program group

876
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,880
I also hope that through me

877
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,560
To pass him on

878
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,080
A passion for food

879
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
Anyway, you don't have to promise anything first

880
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,240
Why don't you try my craft

881
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,720
Yu Hao

882
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,320
You cold-blooded bastard

883
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,040
Balsam pear

884
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Bitter gourd is good. Bitter gourd is on fire

885
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,840
I didn't expect Jin Dao

886
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,000
I also like bitter gourd

887
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,040
My least favorite food

888
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,520
Is balsam pear

889
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,680
I don't like bitter gourd either

890
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,040
You don't like it either

891
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,440
Salted duck eggs with bitter gourd

892
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,640
What kind of dish is this

893
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,920
Can it taste good

894
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,560
Have you eaten

895
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,600
I really haven't eaten it

896
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,840
It's nine o'clock

897
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,360
Haven't called back yet

898
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm sorry

899
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,160
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable

900
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,800
Su Kelan

901
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,800
I told you

902
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,600
The mobile phone needs to be turned on 24 hours a day

903
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,800
It means you don't care

904
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,640
Eating and sleeping

905
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,520
Or are you doing something else

906
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,400
It must be done immediately

907
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,560
Answer my phone right away

908
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,440
Hello, lawyer Shao

909
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,880
About the program group

910
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,240
You send a letter to Love Fresh

911
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,720
They probably want to go public

912
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,600
That's why I risked it

913
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,240
Compensation for the risk of default

914
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,760
I want to be on the show to expand my influence

915
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,920
I guess the hot search is so fast

916
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,000
They should be the ones who did it, too

917
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,760
You take a look at us

918
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,360
The contract for this show

919
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,600
Calculate a maximum amount

920
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,000
Compensation for breach of contract

921
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,760
To scare them

922
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,960
A bunch of program groups

923
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,760
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

924
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,000
Art students who don't understand

925
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
They also believe in blind accounts

926
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,320
Okay, hang up

927
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,600
Su Kelan

928
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,040
No matter where you are now

929
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,280
Immediately, immediately

930
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,320
Meet me at the program group

931
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,400
Don't take mine

932
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,560
I clipped it first

933
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,840
It's delicious

934
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,280
It's delicious

935
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,960
I thought you said you didn't like it

936
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,560
Do you eat balsam pear

937
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,320
Rob so fiercely

938
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,080
Did I say that

939
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,880
Sister Kelan

940
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,080
How did you do it

941
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,120
Teach us

942
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,160
I'll take yours

943
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,960
Many people don't like the taste of bitterness

944
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,320
So go to the bitterness

945
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,240
Be meticulous

946
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,280
Removing pulp, pickling and blanching water

947
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,240
Crush and stir-fry salted egg yolk

948
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,280
Bitter gourd

949
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,880
Bitter gourd wrapped in salted egg yolk

950
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,040
Can neutralize the bitter taste

951
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,280
But it can be preserved

952
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,760
The effect of dispelling fire

953
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,200
Some ingredients even if you don't like them

954
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,800
But as long as it's good to eat it

955
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,120
Then spend some time

956
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,240
You can conjure up surprises

957
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,640
Are you saying

958
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,640
Yu Hao is bitter gourd

959
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
Then he won't fire

960
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,840
I'll fire, I'll fire

961
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,080
Su Kelan

962
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
You just made fried salted eggs with bitter gourd

963
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,760
And Yu Hao's last program

964
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,320
Say something very similar

965
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,440
You wrote his copy, didn't you

966
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,120
Can make such a delicious meal

967
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,040
Someone who can tell such a truth

968
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,840
Then why give it to Yu Hao

969
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,360
This kind of artificial mental retardation does things

970
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,040
Is

971
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
I think

972
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,960
The boss is like a bitter gourd

973
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,320
A lot of people don't like it

974
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
But adults

975
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,960
Who doesn't need to endure hardship

976
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,760
It's not possible

977
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,840
Have you removed the bitterness

978
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,800
You can get rid of the bitterness

979
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,080
But in fact, the bitter bitter gourd has gone

980
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,240
Is soulless

981
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,000
How much nutrition will be lost

982
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,960
I feel

983
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,480
The nutrition of the boss

984
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,800
It's payroll

985
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,680
As a part-time worker

986
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,240
You have to bear hardships

987
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
Working soul

988
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,800
I really can't and I don't force it

989
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,400
Go to the toilet and touch a fish

990
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,320
Wait until the salary is paid

991
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,600
The thought of buying a lot of delicious food

992
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,440
Can make your family happy

993
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,360
Eat well

994
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
Still very happy

995
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
That's true, too

996
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,600
Don't you think it's hard

997
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,000
Because of his fooling around

998
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,480
Big night's

999
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,760
And give us

1000
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,840
Cook so hard

1001
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,000
Big night is hard work

1002
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,240
But cooking is not hard

1003
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,600
A pleasing stomach

1004
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,160
It's much easier than pleasing people

1005
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,480
Jin Dao

1006
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,920
That next program

1007
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,120
When will it be recorded

1008
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,160
It's better for me to go back

1009
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,640
Yu Zong is ready to prepare

1010
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,800
Recorded next Saturday

1011
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,480
Later

1012
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,880
I'll send you the program flow

1013
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,080
Thank you, Jin Dao

1014
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,120
It smells good

1015
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,040
Is the soup ready

1016
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,320
Right oh right oh

1017
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,120
Come on, come on

1018
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,640
Do you have bowls

1019
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,440
Come on, come on

1020
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,560
Bring me the bowl

1021
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,720
Divide it. Divide it

1022
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,720
Everyone has worked hard

1023
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,320
It smells good. It smells good

1024
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:01,800
Jin Dao

1025
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
Come and taste it

1026
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,400
Sister Kelan

1027
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,160
Or you come

1028
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,920
Let's work here

1029
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,360
I really want to be fed every day

1030
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,880
I don't like it because I don't understand it

1031
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,000
Don't understand

1032
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,240
Often because you don't like it

1033
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,120
And don't want to know

1034
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,920
When you take the step of understanding,

1035
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,400
How far is it from liking

1036
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,760
Slow down and drink it hot

1037
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,560
It smells good

1038
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,360
Welcome to

1039
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,840
Gong Wenxing, come out for me

1040
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,520
Gong Wenxing

1041
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,040
Didn't do anything humiliating

1042
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,960
Why are you afraid of being told

1043
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,280
You have to make it clear to me today

1044
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,680
When you dream,

1045
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,400
The "doodle" called

1046
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,320
Who the hell is it

1047
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,800
You can just shout once

1048
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
I dream all day and shout

1049
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,440
I've called it twelve times

1050
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,080
It is also said that it is the person in the animation

1051
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,080
You think someone will believe it

1052
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:26,840
Break up

1053
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,360
Ladies and gentlemen

1054
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,760
This program

1055
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,520
Are you satisfied

1056
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,120
Eat well and drink well

1057
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,360
Pretty good, huh

1058
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,680
Best Actor

1059
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,880
It's already the sixth

1060
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,960
You broke up with me like this

1061
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,200
Why don't you believe it

1062
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,040
I said it in my dream

1063
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,080
It's an animated character

1064
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,080
I see

1065
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
You're screaming at all

1066
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,680
It's not the people in cartoons

1067
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,360
Is to watch it with you

1068
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,080
Animated people, right

1069
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,040
Change the subject

1070
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,400
Come

1071
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,120
Let's see how my shop is doing

1072
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,120
Just so-so

1073
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,560
A mess

1074
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,880
Don't rely on anywhere

1075
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,160
If you don't win for a month, you will win

1076
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,760
Your uncle opened my shop today

1077
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,240
It is also specially given to your employees

1078
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:23,960
Fold a gift

1079
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,280
That's what you say about me

1080
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,440
I this

1081
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,440
Where's the mess

1082
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,160
Chinese small master

1083
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
You liked it when you were a kid

1084
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Shouting to watch it every day

1085
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,920
To take me into the pit, okay

1086
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,120
Now you dislike it again

1087
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,200
It was you when I was a child

1088
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,240
Crying and shouting for me to watch with you

1089
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:40,560
Big Brother

1090
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,640
Call Uncle

1091
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,840
You are a man

1092
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,800
Honesty in the past is eaten by dogs

1093
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,640
Also

1094
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,520
What body double do honest people use

1095
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,400
Make what people set up

1096
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,640
Profiteers

1097
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,280
You made such a big deal about it

1098
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,560
What's the matter

1099
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Someone is dealing with it

1100
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,320
Don't worry about it

1101
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,160
You must do this personally

1102
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,960
People who even have to read the code for themselves

1103
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,200
Let others handle it with confidence

1104
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,160
What person

1105
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,120
Let you feel so at ease

1106
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,160
Don't move your hands and feet

1107
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,920
Look at you like that

1108
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,080
Let's order

1109
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,960
I'm sorry

1110
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,840
I'm late

1111
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,440
The blind date is still so late

1112
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,200
This child is really

1113
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,160
Nothing, nothing

1114
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,560
Just got back from Chengdu

1115
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,280
Sit down

1116
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,480
Greet the guests quickly

1117
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,440
My son Li Xun

1118
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,760
"What to Eat" Chengdu Company

1119
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
Marketing Director

1120
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,200
Extremely busy at work

1121
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,880
It's okay, it's okay

1122
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,360
A little gift

1123
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,200
Thank you

1124
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,800
Eat quickly, eat quickly

1125
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,120
I'm so embarrassed

1126
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,000
Sister Kelan, where is your car parked

1127
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,920
I didn't drive

1128
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,520
Sister Kelan, you don't drive

1129
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,800
Yu Hao's treatment is not good either

1130
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,160
Public relations director does not have a car

1131
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,640
Sister Kelan

1132
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,440
Why don't you come to us

1133
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:08,840
Go to work in the company

1134
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,320
Yeah, come and work with us

1135
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,960
No

1136
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,000
Because I was born

1137
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
There is no sense of direction

1138
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,120
I can't drive a car

1139
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,400
People can't drive a car

1140
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,960
It's so late

1141
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,920
I drive

1142
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,800
Let me give you a ride

1143
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,880
No, thank you, Jin Dao

1144
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,200
My boyfriend will be here in a minute

1145
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,520
I

1146
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Wait for him

1147
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,360
You go first

1148
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,600
Then guide us to withdraw first

1149
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,520
Bye, Sister Kelan

1150
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,920
Good bye bye bye

1151
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,720
Colan

1152
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,480
I just said

1153
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,440
Agree not to change the sponsor for the time being

1154
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,080
Is to give Yu Hao another chance

1155
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,720
But he can't be like before

1156
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,680
Use body double on the show

1157
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,880
This is the bottom line

1158
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,240
I won't give in

1159
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,920
Understand

1160
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,680
Jin Dao, you can rest assured

1161
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,920
I will convince Yu Zong

1162
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,800
Cook in person

1163
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,720
That

1164
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,400
It must be confirmed by tomorrow at the latest

1165
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,040
Good

1166
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,600
Go away

1167
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,560
Bye bye

1168
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,600
Sorry

1169
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,680
It's too late to communicate with the program group

1170
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,520
The details will be reported tomorrow

1171
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,880
Go to bed early

1172
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,480
Boss

1173
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,160
Don't send it

1174
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,600
What's to be delivered, what's to be delivered

1175
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,560
In the future

1176
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,760
Just ask the children to contact themselves more

1177
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:53,880
Yes

1178
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,520
The car I called for you will be here soon

1179
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,760
Just one intersection away

1180
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,640
How sweet

1181
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,480
Isn't that true

1182
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,520
Go

1183
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,680
This way

1184
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,600
OK, then you walk slowly, huh

1185
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,400
Be careful

1186
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,000
Be careful

1187
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,720
Auntie, I'll go first

1188
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,200
Good bye

1189
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Bye-bye-bye

1190
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,040
Bye bye

1191
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,560
Bye bye bye bye

1192
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,600
Slow down on the road

1193
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,040
OK

1194
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,240
Hello

1195
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,440
Hello

1196
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,520
I was in the office just now

1197
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,840
The director wants me to have something to do

1198
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,360
I knew you were busy

1199
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,520
What about you

1200
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,080
Are you done with the matter

1201
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,600
Something like that

1202
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,280
Fortunately, I can catch the last bus

1203
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,440
Or you'll have to spend money again

1204
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,880
Last bus

1205
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,760
Do you take the bus or the subway

1206
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,720
It's so late to take a taxi

1207
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,520
Don't

1208
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,280
Don't waste the money

1209
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,160
Reluctant

1210
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,320
Also

1211
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,160
Your mother's sick to save money

1212
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,120
How about this

1213
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,480
Where are you? I'll call a cab for you

1214
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,360
No need

1215
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,400
I have arrived at the bus stop

1216
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,320
Stop talking. The bus is coming. Hang up

1217
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,200
Give her a taxi

1218
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,680
Why spend the money

1219
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,360
It's just talk

1220
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,720
It's not like she really wants to

1221
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:29,960
That's right

1222
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,480
Market report

1223
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,800
Can you do me a favor

1224
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,840
No

1225
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,120
I will work an extra day tomorrow

1226
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,520
Then you'd better come back

1227
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,440
I'll send it to your email in the evening

1228
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,520
I said

1229
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,960
What do you think of that girl

1230
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,880
Li Xun

1231
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,200
How come he's back today

1232
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,040
What are you looking at

1233
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,880
Let's go. Let's have supper. Let's go

1234
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,720
Mom picked it out

1235
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,840
Of course I believe my mother's eyes

1236
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,080
Welcome to

1237
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,960
The handmade lunch box I gave her

1238
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,720
I forgot to take it

1239
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,600
Is it

1240
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,280
Su Kelan is particularly good at this

1241
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,280
Immaterial

1242
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,120
When I was reading,

1243
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,240
A lunch box for her

1244
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,960
It's all precious now

1245
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,640
Immaterial can be eaten as food

1246
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,120
Her father's gone

1247
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,720
Mom is a medicine jar again

1248
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,720
Your whole life

1249
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,880
Do you want to be dragged down by her

1250
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,080
But

1251
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,960
Don't be in a hurry to split with her yet

1252
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,680
You work in Chengdu

1253
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,240
Mom needs someone to take care of, too

1254
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,240
It's more cost-effective than hiring a nanny

1255
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,760
I said I

1256
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,960
How can you be so clever

1257
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,600
It turned out to be hereditary, mom

1258
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,720
The best scum mother and son

1259
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,800
Hello

1260
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,040

1261
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,680
Wang Tingting

1262
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,000
Female

1263
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,440
Hang up

1264
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,320
Pretending to be your employee

1265
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,880
Why

1266
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,960
In order to lead my opening lo mei

1267
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,240
Isn't this wonderful? This

1268
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,280
Sorry

1269
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,120
It's too late to communicate with the program group

1270
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,880
The details will be reported tomorrow

1271
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,000
Go to bed early

1272
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,600
Boss

1273
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,960
Have you eaten almost

1274
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:50,800
Row

1275
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,640
Almost

1276
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,480
The waiter pays the bill

1277
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,880
Do you have fat intestines here

1278
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,920
The kind that is especially clean

1279
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,880
Understand

1280
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,720
How do you do

1281
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,040
A total of three hundred eighty-two

1282
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,640
Have a look at it

1283
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,560
Sweep me

1284
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,400
Eat what company employees

1285
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,880
I thought I was going to send something

1286
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,200
Boss

1287
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,400
It was originally possible to send fat intestines

1288
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,680
But it seems

1289
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,800
Delivered

1290
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,200
What's finished

1291
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,320
Isn't that what it is

1292
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,480
This

1293
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,400
You do business

1294
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,000
Don't you talk about honesty

1295
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,520
Go

1296
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,120
Walk slowly

1297
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,360
Not bad

1298
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,800
And the last bus

1299
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:43,880
Sit down

1300
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,200
Feed mom

1301
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,240
I'm done

1302
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,440
Waiting for the bus

1303
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,400
It's so late and it's raining

1304
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,840
You get a cab back

1305
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,800
I don't

1306
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,240
What kind of car do you take

1307
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,120
This taxi money is saved

1308
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,640
How nice it would be to eat more delicious food

1309
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,800
Oh, don't worry

1310
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,640
It's okay

1311
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,120
Okay, I won't talk to you

1312
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,320
Here comes the bus. I hang up

1313
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,200
Deceive

1314
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,400
I didn't hear the car at all

1315
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,920
Send me the address

1316
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,880
I'll call you a cab

1317
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,240
I didn't lie to you

1318
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,960
Really, the car is really coming

1319
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,840
Don't wait for me

1320
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,800
You go to bed early

1321
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,400
I'll be back soon

1322
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,000
Bye bye

1323
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,560
Recorded next Saturday

1324
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,480
Thank you, Jin Dao

1325
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,520
Su Kelan is particularly good at this

1326
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,560
Immaterial

1327
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,480
Her father's gone

1328
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,720
Mom is a medicine jar again

1329
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,440
No matter can be eaten as food

1330
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,760
Hello, a special car is at your service

1331
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,000
Excuse me, is this Miss Su

00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,760

Get in the car, please

1335
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,200
Mom

1336
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,000
Did you call me the car

1337
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,880
How do you do, Miss Su

1338
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,240
What is your destination, please

1339
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,800
The person who placed your order

1340
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,840
Let me and you

1341
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,600
Determine the destination

1342
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,320
Come back

1343
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:41,920
Mom

1344
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,320
You're still up

1345
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,360
Didn't you get caught in the rain

1346
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,360
No

1347
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,840
Mom, you haven't eaten yet

1348
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,680
Come and wipe it quickly

1349
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,800
I've already eaten a little

1350
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,200
But I still have to wait for you to come back

1351
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:00,800
Wait a minute

1352
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,760
And the soup. I'll heat it up

1353
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,760
I think it's raining

1354
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,360
Have some soup

1355
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,600
Warm and warm

1356
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,640
Mom, why are you watching this play again

1357
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,320
What again

1358
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:37,960
Just released

1359
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,200
Didn't I just finish reading it a few days ago

1360
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,080
The finale

1361
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,800
You've seen the play five times, haven't you

1362
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,440
Is there

1363
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,320
I didn't see this the other day, did I

1364
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,120
That's it

1365
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,320
Overwork late into the night

1366
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,680
There will always be fatigue

1367
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,120
The Moment of Healing

1368
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,520
It's under a lamp

1369
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,120
A delicious meal

1370
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,240
And family

1371
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,640
In the lonely night

1372
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,840
Is there any rice fragrance that can cure you?

1373
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,560
Feed Yu Zong

1374
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,040
It was agreed at 9:30 this morning

1375
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,280
Report to the company

1376
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,520
Do you know what time it is

1377
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,840
Are you going to take Saturday off

1378
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,080
Are you financially free

1379
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Yu

1380
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,040
I'll be right there

1381
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,560
Mom, why didn't my alarm clock go off

1382
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,640
Did you do it

1383
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,400
Yelling at me again

1384
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:23,640
Can't you just put

1385
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,040
Gentleness towards others

1386
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,680
Shall I share some with my mother

1387
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,040
Isn't it Saturday

1388
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,560
What happened to you yesterday

1389
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,320
Isn't it already done

1390
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,560
From the end of processing

1391
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,080
There is still a long way to go

1392
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,320
Mom, I'm leaving

1393
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,440
Have you arrived in Chongqing yet

1394
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,840
OK, I have to work overtime

1395
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,200
Go home a little later

1396
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,960
Then come to my house for dinner at seven tonight

1397
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,360
Good. See you tonight

1398
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,440
Feed Mengmeng

1399
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,640
Li Zhi and Aunt Wang

1400
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,280
Come to my house for dinner in the evening

1401
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:07,920
You and your parents

1402
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,000
Would you like to come along

1403
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,920
Sure

1404
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,800
You said that the two of us

1405
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,240
I live upstairs and downstairs

1406
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:17,880
What can I do for you

1407
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,280
What other phone bills are you wasting

1408
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,440
Why don't you just shout one voice

1409
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,600
Now that you're out of the house

1410
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,920
Don't hurry back either

1411
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,400
Turn your head and help me buy food

1412
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,200
You're not going with me

1413
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,960
I work overtime

1414
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:28,960
Overtime

1415
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,600
Because of what happened last night

1416
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,520
I'll talk to you about it later

1417
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,360
If Li Zhi and Aunt Wang

1418
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,520
If you arrive first

1419
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,800
Why don't you say hello for me

1420
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,440
Row

1421
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,080
Li Zhi said he would get on the train later

1422
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,040
It may arrive at four or five in the afternoon

1423
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:43,800
Wait a minute

1424
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,280
Get on the train later

1425
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,440
Yeah

1426
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,360
He came back from Chengdu

1427
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,840
What's the matter

1428
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:00,760
Do you remember before

1429
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,000
I told you before

1430
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,120
A sweet-mouthed person like Li Zhi

1431
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,920
Not necessarily reliable

1432
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,680
What do you mean

1433
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,360
Li Zhi has come back long ago

1434
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,400
Last night

1435
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,640
I saw him in the company

1436
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,800
Nearby restaurant

1437
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,720
Are you mistaken

1438
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,080
I went to work

1439
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,120
Remember to help me buy food

1440
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,440
Your best friend's 5:0 vision

1441
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,240
Can't be trusted

1442
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,200
You said immediately

1443
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,320
How long will it take

1444
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,400
Do you want to do it or not

1445
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,240
Cats know to go to work on time

1446
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,360
Xiao Hei

1447
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,600
Time for dinner

1448
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,560
Let you work overtime

1449
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,400
You feed the cat

1450
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,120
Where's Wan Shun

1451
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,080
How is Wan Shun today

1452
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,040
I'm not with you.

1453
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,800
Wan Shun

1454
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,640
Wan Shun

1455
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,760
Wan Shun

1456
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,120
Li Zhi has come back long ago

1457
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,040
Do you remember before

1458
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,960
I told you before

1459
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,080
A sweet-mouthed person like Li Zhi

1460
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,000
Not necessarily reliable

1461
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,160
Wan Shun

1462
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,600
You can't let little black

1463
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,680
Willing to believe you

1464
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,080
Just lie to it

1465
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,280
If you lie to it,

1466
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,160
There will be no fish balls to eat

1467
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,160
There may not be time in the future

1468
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,840
I cooked fish balls for you

1469
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,680
Come and eat more

1470
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,480
Eat it

1471
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,240
You're not eating

1472
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,400
Then I'll leave it here for you

1473
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,560
Remember to eat later

1474
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,440
Xiaoyi

1475
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,360
Can people eat cat food

1476
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,960
Yu Zonghao

1477
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,280
What happened

1478
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,040
Excuse me

1479
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,760
Would you please go out and wait for a while

1480
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,000
I'll call you later

1481
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,520
Yu Zong

1482
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,960
You gave it to me

1483
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,200
Communication task of program group

1484
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
It has been completed

1485
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,240
The next program will be recorded in seven days

1486
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,240
That's good

1487
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,760
What about the three chefs

1488
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,280
Let you choose one, Mr. Yu

1489
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,560
Learn to cook with him

1490
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:50,840
This is what you call

1491
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,800
Is the communication result

1492
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,800
Learn to cook with them

1493
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,360
Your communication result

1494
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,880
What's the difference with Jing Chen

1495
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,880
Like the program group,

1496
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,840
Blackmail demands

1497
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,640
Only zero times and countless times, understand

1498
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,560
Yu Zong

1499
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,400
They're not blackmailing you

1500
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,800
It's just that there is something wrong with their method

1501
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,080
But they're now

1502
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,120
Have realized that

1503
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,280
You see

1504
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,760
I went to work

1505
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,000
Wait

1506
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,160
One more thing

1507
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,520
We really shouldn't

1508
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,280
For the sake of program effect

1509
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,600
By such despicable means

1510
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,200
Push Yu Zong to the forefront

1511
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,080
You come again

1512
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,920
We really shouldn't

1513
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,040
For the program group

1514
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,760
By such despicable means

1515
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,440
Push Yu Zong to the forefront

1516
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,760
I hope you can convey to Yu Zong

1517
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,200
Our previous apologies

1518
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,360
I hope your company

1519
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,880
It can cooperate for the long term in the future

1520
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,440
Make some sacrifices

1521
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,000
Jin Xuan apologized, didn't he

1522
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,840
That's not possible either

1523
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:11,920
Learn to cook with them

1524
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,320
It's a waste of time

1525
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:19,840
Yu Zong

1526
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,200
You exercise regularly every day

1527
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,680
Two hours

1528
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,080
Fitness

1529
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,200
Can't increase the turnover of the company

1530
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,160
But

1531
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,360
Because of fitness

1532
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,960
Enhance your image

1533
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,880
Savings for the company

1534
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,960
Celebrity endorsement fee

1535
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,600
Let the advertising budget of the public relations department

1536
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,440
Saved 37%

1537
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,320
Simultaneously

1538
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,520
Fitness is reduced

1539
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,640
Your health risks

1540
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,720
Lower

1541
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:46,920
In case you get sick

1542
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,320
Will bring it to the company

1543
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,320
Potential loss

1544
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,200
Some things seem useless

1545
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,360
But it can produce greater value

1546
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,880
From participating

1547
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,080
"Have a good meal with you"

1548
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:04,960
The turnover of a company

1549
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,480
It increased by 7.352%

1550
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,200
Visible

1551
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,200
Yu Zong, you are in the program

1552
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,360
The image of loving food

1553
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,280
Help improve the image of the company

1554
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,240
If you learn to cook,

1555
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,440
Make you proficient in food

1556
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,680
This image is solid

1557
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,600
That

1558
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,280
Even if the future program is over,

1559
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,480
It can also keep the public

1560
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,360
Object to the application

1561
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,880
Affection and trust

1562
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,240
Considering from the time cost

1563
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,560
Mr. Yu, you are young, promising and smart

1564
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,400
It's so difficult to run a company

1565
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,720
You are a cinch

1566
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,960
Time to learn to cook during the program

1567
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,120
Average to every day

1568
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,360
It just takes you

1569
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,720
For three minutes

1570
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:40,960
Or

1571
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,360
You try it first

1572
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,000
Analysis of the first half

1573
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,960
That's quite accurate

1574
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,520
In the second half, except for kissing up

1575
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,920
There is no substantive content

1576
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,800
It's all crap

1577
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,480
Not flattery

1578
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,600
It's a fact

1579
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,880
Aren't you clever, Mr. Yu

1580
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,360
I made an appointment to walk for five minutes

1581
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,000
You can go to the back kitchen of the restaurant

1582
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,160
Boss

1583
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,960
Move the car

1584
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,160
Investigate the chef

1585
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,000
Stir-fried kidney flower

1586
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,800
Look at the heat

1587
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,440
Ironing three wires and watching knives

1588
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,600
Squirrel mandarin fish to see seasoning

1589
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,280
Let's call it a day

1590
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,240
Would you please go back first

1591
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:06,960
Wait for my news

1592
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,720
I'll talk to you later

1593
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,400
Hard work

1594
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,680
Baby, I got off the train

1595
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,840
When will you be back

1596
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:23,920
I miss you

1597
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,000
After dinner in the evening

1598
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,520
Let's go see a movie together

1599
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,400
Last night

1600
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,040
I saw Li Zhi and his family in the company

1601
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,280
Have dinner in a nearby restaurant

1602
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,000
Mr. Yu is right about the chef just now

1603
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,320
Not satisfied with any of them

1604
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:44,880
Flashy and unrealistic

1605
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,240
It doesn't fit at all

1606
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,160
"What's next?"

1607
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,040
Brand image

1608
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,640
Do you think it's appropriate

1609
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:56,840
You don't even think it's appropriate

1610
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,800
And asked me what I was doing

1611
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,960
What kind of food do you think

1612
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,240
Conform to the brand image of the company

1613
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,760
I remember

1614
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,120
I saw a passage

1615
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,080
The matter of eating

1616
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,960
It's quite interesting

1617
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,440
When you eat alone,

1618
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,520
Don't think there's anything

1619
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,400
Once you start

1620
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,800
Someone ate with you

1621
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,880
When you eat alone again,

1622
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,440
You will feel lonely

1623
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,360
Loneliness

1624
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,520
May

1625
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,680
What matters is not what to eat

1626
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,240
But when you eat

1627
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,920
With whom

1628
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,360
I hear you're good at cooking

1629
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,800
Why don't you try it

1630
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,400
This thing needs to be done

1631
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,360
Someone will do it

1632
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,000
You try it

1633
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,800
Make a

1634
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,560
When the interview was held

1635
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,040
But Yu Zong, I am now

1636
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,160
If you can

1637
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:04,840
Tomorrow I'll have the finance

1638
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,320
Put the tuition fee on your card

1639
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,360
I heard that you usually go to work

1640
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,760
I'm not even willing to take a taxi

1641
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,120
Should be very short of money

1642
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,240
As it is now

1643
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,080
Extra money opportunities falling from the sky

1644
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,120
Are you sure you don't want it
