1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,160
Mr. Yu, this is

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,280
Director of Public Relations

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,080
It's the business card of the company

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
I won't allow her to be outside

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,200
The man who lost the company

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,120
Give it a try

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,200
No one knows who I am

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,240
Get me some high heels

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,840
Give her a try

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,800
Yu Zong

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,280
My flat feet

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,600
I usually wear flat shoes

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,280
Will fall

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,440
I'll just hold you

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Will Lost Stars

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,280
I can't remember the lyrics

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,400
What about "I like your company"

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,720
Okay, that's it

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,080
I'll borrow it. Thank you

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,760
Come on

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,040
Your long hair is soft and loose

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,280
Curl up lazily on the sofa

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,800
Coffee

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,480
Bloom a milk flower

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,600
Slowly melting palms

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,720
It's getting dark slowly

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
The kitchen lit up

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Get used to it day by day

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,800
A little warmth

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,360
Smoke from kitchen chimneys

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,760
You have short hair in fluffy hair

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,520
Play the guitar gently

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,360
Sweater

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,920
Just exposed to the sun

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,160
Warm and reassuring

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,200
It's getting dark slowly

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,520
Time doesn't want to go away

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,080
This is what you like

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,720
Romantic

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,320
I like to have it day by day

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Your company

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
A tea and a meal are simple

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
One heart and one wish

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,440
Kiss you and say good night

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,960
Year after year, life after life

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Bottles and cans in the morning and evening

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,720
Eat together every day

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,600
Kiss you every day and say

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,280
Good night

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,480
How is it

51
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,600
Luo Da Duo Group

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,560
Don't you live up to your reputation

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,800
Yes

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Bin Da Sao is also worthy of his reputation

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,760
Right

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,480
Champion

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,760
Who are you

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,320
Do you know us very well

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,560
Hello, this classmate

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,440
My name is Gong Wenxing

61
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,360
It belongs to your boss

62
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Uncle

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,720
Are you leaving or not

64
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,640
What do you mean

65
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,480
I can't afford to lose

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,600
Are you all right

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,440
Nothing

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,480
Excuse me

69
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,720
My shoes

70
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,240
Get up first

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Yu Zong

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
Your dismissal

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
The personnel department will tell the peers truthfully

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,880
With your marketing department

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,280
Rank of ordinary staff

76
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Estimate that other companies

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,680
It's not worth it for you

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,640
Do a survey of dedication

79
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,400
Dismissal

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,040
Ordinary employee

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,720
You don't talk about yourself

82
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,440
He is the director of marketing department

83
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,000
There were people a few days ago

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,240
Are you digging your corner

85
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,200
A consecutive competition ranking

86
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,120
And job information

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,960
People who fake everything

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Can you believe what you say

89
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Qianqian, let me explain

90
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,200
Play well

91
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,920
Do it again

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
Tonight's champion

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
Get a full set of kitchen utensils

94
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,760
And singing all night is

95
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,880
The last couple

96
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,280
Congratulations to them

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,920
I saw through her heart

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,240
It's all about her and his movies

99
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,160
She doesn't love me

100
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,520
She doesn't love me

101
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,920
Guide

102
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,440
Don't be sad

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,320
It's a good thing you didn't go just now

104
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,040
That's right. That's right

105
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,800
What do you mean

106
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,360
What I mean is

107
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
What do you mean

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,280
What do you mean

109
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,960
Hide

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,680
Hide

111
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,520
So say

112
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,840
You drove Chrysanthemum downstairs

113
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,520
Right

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,880
That Li Zhi, that scum

115
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,440
Fat intestines to eat

116
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
It's from you

117
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,040
Yeah

118
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,640
I'll go

119
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,520
Nice work, buddy

120
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,520
You haven't eaten garlic today, have you

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,040
Didn't eat fat intestines

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
This kind of smelly thing

123
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,400
She doesn't love

124
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Don't love me

125
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,200
She doesn't love me

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,720
Thank you

127
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,600
Isn't that what you want

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,200
Write

129
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,920
My kitchen

130
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,720
As if

131
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,800
Can't let go of so many things

132
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
So you said you wanted

133
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
I was just thinking about it

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
Send me that

135
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,160
Think of it as learning materials

136
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,680
Good

137
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Thank you

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,720
Then I'll go back first

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,440
You just stay here

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,560
That's right

141
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,040
I still need my cell phone

142
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Keep it open 24 hours a day

143
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,320
If there's anything

144
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
In case of emergency

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,040
Need to be dealt with at any time

146
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,200
Yu Zong

147
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,400
Yu Zong

148
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,960
Yu Zong

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
Don't you sing together, Mr. Yu

150
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,560
You won by your ability to sing for free

151
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,440
Don't waste it

152
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Sing alone for an hour

153
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
How much is it worth

154
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,000
I work for an hour

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,080
How much is it worth

156
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,440
How much is it wasted to walk

157
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,400
Don't go

158
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,400
How much will be wasted

159
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,320
This account

160
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
You can't figure it out

161
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,960
Yu Zong

162
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you

163
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,840
Rain culvert

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,240
Is it a hotel upstairs

165
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,680
Book a suite

166
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,400
No, no, no

167
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,680
One looks too fake

168
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,040
Call it my room

169
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,160
Director a room

170
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,120
Yu Zong Yi Room

171
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,240
The hotel manager upstairs just now

172
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,000
Meet me

173
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,280
Recognize someone else

174
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,960
Want me to tweet

175
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,080
Promotion of Hotels

176
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
So I sent several suites

177
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
I suppose you're tired

178
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,560
Or we'll go to the hotel

179
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,280
Have a rest

180
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,160
Why are there so many reporters

181
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,880
Can you stop filming

182
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,560
Don't shoot

183
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,600
You see, it's all reported

184
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
What shall I do

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,320
Then let's be together

186
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,840
Rain culvert

187
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,040
Ask the waiter to deliver two more cases of wine

188
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,080
Tomorrow morning

189
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Let the media squat at the entrance of the hotel

190
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,720
Not sister

191
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,400
Such a difficult operation

192
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,520
Can you really finish it

193
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,520
First of all

194
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
It has always been your wishful thinking

195
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,040
Unrequited love

196
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,800
Yu doesn't like you at all

197
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,240
How can I drink with you

198
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,640
Even if Yu always drinks wine,

199
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
Then why not let

200
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,600
The staff sent him home

201
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,520
Even if Yu Zong

202
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,400
I rested at the hotel

203
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,320
I won't let you

204
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,040
Into his room

205
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,680
I

206
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,320
Difficulties are used to overcome

207
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,240
Problems are used to solve

208
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Where there is a way, there will be a way

209
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Where there is a will, there is a way

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,160
Can't you just understand it?

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
It'll be fine in a while

212
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,680
Look how I can

213
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,040
Take care of him

214
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,640
Not really

215
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Will wear high heels

216
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,040
This outfit

217
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,520
It really doesn't suit me

218
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,680
I left it in your car

219
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,720
Clothes and shoes

220
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,520
Could you please get it back for me

221
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm afraid I'm wearing

222
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,160
High heels can't walk

223
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,600
Love you

224
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,400
Love you

225
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,840
Hold you with all your strength

226
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Let the world know

227
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,800
I cherish you

228
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Love

229
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,040
Colan

230
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,800
There you are

231
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,520
Come here, come here

232
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:30,920
Come

233
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,360
Let me introduce you

234
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,200
This one

235
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,560
Yu Hao's uncle

236
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,320
Gong Wenxing

237
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,840
Hi

238
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,360
My boyfriend

239
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,360
Where's Yu Hao

240
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,240
I introduced his aunt

241
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,720
Get to know him

242
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,520
Yeah

243
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,480
Where did he go

244
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
I ordered two more cases of wine

245
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
Don't get drunk tonight

246
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,560
Lai Kelan

247
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,640
Where's Yu Hao

248
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,080
I'm sorry I'm sorry

249
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,880
Lin

250
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's go

251
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,000
We're in a karaoke bar

252
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,560
It's not a bar

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,760
Don't you think

254
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,480
The atmosphere is strange

255
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,520
How can you be preempted

256
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,120
This little flower

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,240
Must be coveting Yu Zong

258
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
But I saw Yu Zong again

259
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,040
Chorus with Colan

260
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,000
Stimulated

261
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,680
Current record

262
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,200
Nine bottles

263
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,400
Look at this

264
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,080
A bandit-like director

265
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,080
It seems that I want to chat with Su Kelan

266
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,520
But so far

267
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,000
I didn't say a word

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
Stand up once

269
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,480
Go back once

270
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,400
Drink a bottle of wine

271
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Current record

272
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
Twelve bottles

273
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Your best friend today

274
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
Shouldn't you be a winner in life

275
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,920
How can I also use wine to drown my sorrows

276
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,640
Then don't ask your nephew

277
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,120
Where are the people? Where are they

278
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,200
My nephew

279
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,720
Surplus

280
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,680
Yu Zong

281
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,480
Where have you been

282
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Do you have to fine a glass

283
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,720
What is this for

284
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,360
What's the matter? This is

285
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
It's time for everyone to sing

286
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,920
I have a proposal

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
Cheers

288
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,800
I maths

289
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,800
Never more than twenty points

290
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,040
Drink

291
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,080
Pig brain

292
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Pig brain

293
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
The actress

294
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,880
Always fill the remaining total wine

295
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,960
There must be some attempt

296
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,280
Yu Zong

297
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,120
This is mine

298
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,640
It's my turn

299
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,920
I

300
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
Single dog

301
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,240
No object

302
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,600
None of them

303
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,600
Just the two of us

304
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,320
Take your hands back

305
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,280
Wine to drink

306
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,960
Guide you to drink confused

307
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,520
It's all single dog with no object

308
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,000
Why do you hurt each other

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,080
I never had a date

310
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,880
Born to be single, can you compete

311
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,960
Single

312
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,960
Director

313
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,440
You let the stylist

314
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,360
Tidy it up for you

315
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,960
Just like you

316
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,240
Which girl dares to ask you

317
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,640
Isn't it? Isn't it

318
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,960
Why are you staring at me?

319
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,880
Again fierce person

320
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,480
What's wrong with you

321
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,120
The goods

322
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,400
He has a better temper than me

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,440
It's annoying and special

324
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
You're not like hungry wolves

325
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
Staring at him like that

326
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,200
Look at the face value

327
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,000
Look at the shape

328
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,840
Follow his uncle

329
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,440
Follow me

330
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,520
Come on, come on

331
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,040
Dominate Linglan

332
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,960
Is the temperament of a man

333
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,640
Come

334
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,560
Conducting

335
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,800
This is his nature

336
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,400
Luowai Long Valley

337
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
So many titles

338
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,080
How handsome

339
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Also dominating Linglan

340
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,520
Have you seen too many movies?

341
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,240
Think you are a martial arts master

342
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,240
How to compare

343
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,160
Lie down or lie down

344
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,800
Conductor

345
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,680
When you come, you will be safe

346
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,360
Just sit here and continue to play

347
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,320
Yeah

348
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,680
Sure

349
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,640
Hello

350
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,600
My position is open

351
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,040
Start and open

352
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,720
Can't afford

353
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,680
Start and open

354
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,520
Can't afford

355
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,360
Start and open

356
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,840
Colan said

357
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,080
Why are you sitting here

358
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,960
Pain, pain, pain

359
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,480
Come on, come on

360
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,280
Drink, drink, drink

361
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,640
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

362
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
Yu always drinks

363
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,240
Go on, go on

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,080
Cheers, cheers

365
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,320
Here's a toast. Cheers

366
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,800
Cheers

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,480
Continue

368
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,800
It's my turn. It's my turn

369
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,080
It's my turn

370
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,440
I have Han Meng

371
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,440
No

372
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,560
A few meanings you

373
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,000
Sister Bi, are you all right

374
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,320
Nothing

375
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,800
For a while

376
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,200
I'll let them go back to their rooms and rest

377
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
You go and take Yu Hao's

378
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,800
Those two staff members diverted

379
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,600
That's right

380
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,840
Have you arranged the reporter

381
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,840
All right

382
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,320
Lipstick Lipstick

383
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,880
Go on, go on

384
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,360
Elder sister

385
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,400
Don't you see I'm busy

386
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,920
Perfect

387
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,520
Go

388
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Let's go

389
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,760
I'm back

390
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,040
Where are the people

391
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,400
Where are the people

392
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,920
People left early

393
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,240
Want to say hello to you

394
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,680
As a result, you didn't come out for a long time

395
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,400
You wouldn't have told me

396
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,720
Go away

397
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,360
Go away

398
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Go away

399
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,160
Slow down, slow down, slow down

400
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,560
Bye. Be careful on the road

401
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,920
What's your situation? You

402
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,320
What, what situation

403
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,240
Are peach blossoms flourishing

404
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,600
The Great Demon King is back

405
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,480
Play and drink together

406
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,440
It is clear that you are not at ease

407
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,800
The bandit-like director

408
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,040
You see him telling the truth after drinking

409
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,680
Choking with him

410
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,360
Don't even let him sit next to you

411
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
When did you take care of the Great Devil

412
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,520
How could I not know

413
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
What's done?

414
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,600
Dudu

415
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,440
It's all gone. It's all gone

416
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,160
This way this way

417
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,040
Is Yu always all right

418
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,840
He can't drink well

419
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
But vomiting will be fine

420
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,920
Who can't drink well

421
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,680
I can't drink well

422
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,120
I can drink very well

423
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Your nephew finished drinking

424
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,520
That's it

425
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,800
Nor is it

426
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,800
He

427
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,680
Why don't you send him home

428
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,520
Where is his home

429
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,160
Don't go home

430
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,480
To what home

431
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,760
Go home anyway

432
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,800
Mom and Dad are not here either

433
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,600
No return

434
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,480
No return, no return

435
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,960
That

436
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,840
How about this, then

437
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,960
Colan's

438
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,040
You send him back to his room to rest

439
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,120
I have a little upset in my stomach

440
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,920
I'll get some medicine

441
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,640
The room was delivered anyway

442
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,440
No need for nothing

443
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,080
Don't waste

444
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,920
I'm not feeling well either

445
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,480
Then let's go together

446
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,600
One piece, one piece

447
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Let's go let's go let's go

448
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,520
Walk, walk

449
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,360
Mengmeng

450
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,880
Yu Zong

451
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,360
Wait a minute.

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Yu Zong

453
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,760
Wait a minute. Let me have a look

454
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,920
This way

455
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,640
This way

456
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,320
Mr. Yu, wait a minute

457
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,240
Keep drinking

458
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,200
Slow down

459
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,080
Feed mom

460
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,000
I have something to do now

461
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,720
I'll be home a little late

462
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,880
Don't wait up for me

463
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,360
Go to bed early

464
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,520
Good

465
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,560
Bye bye

466
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,040
Colan said

467
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,880
Why are you sitting here

468
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
Pain, pain, pain

469
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Yu Zong

470
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,960
What are you doing

471
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,760
Cook for you to eat

472
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,440
It's getting late now

473
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm going home

474
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,720
Didn't you eat

475
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Make you something to eat

476
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
You're drunk

477
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,400
I boiled water for you

478
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,720
You have some tea later

479
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,520
Go to bed early

480
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,320
I'm not drunk

481
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,320
Don't sleep

482
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,040
Make you something to eat

483
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,240
There is no food

484
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,840
Nothing

485
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,440
You go to bed early

486
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,760
There will be a meeting tomorrow morning

487
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Nothing

488
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,800
Go buy

489
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,600
In the middle of the night

490
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,360
Where to buy it

491
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,120
Buy

492
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,880
Let's go

493
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,440
Go

494
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,200
Boss

495
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,920
What the hell are you doing

496
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,760
Boss

497
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,680
Let's just go

498
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,440
In case someone comes

499
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,160
What shall I do

500
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,520
Found the refrigerator

501
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,120
Ah

502
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,960
Boss

503
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,440
I'm going to do a good job today

504
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,800
Spend it

505
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,480
Boss

506
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,160
Let's just go

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,880
In case someone finds out

508
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,360
You steal food here

509
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,960
How bad it is to get out

510
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,360
What are you afraid of

511
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,600
It's not like I don't give money

512
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,720
Where are the tomatoes

513
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,680
What about you

514
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,360
I like tomatoes best

515
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,080
Here you go

516
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,760
Boss, let's go

517
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,680
My stomach hurts

518
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,440
What's wrong with you

519
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,320
What a big egg I laid

520
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,000
What if I mutate

521
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,160
Why did I start laying eggs

522
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,640
What for

523
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,720
Squat down, squat down

524
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,640
Don't talk

525
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,920
All right

526
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,800
Let's go

527
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,920
What we just did

528
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
Does it look like an ostrich

529
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,120
How should I eat this egg

530
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,440
Won't you eat

531
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,000
Why

532
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,720
Don't eat at the table

533
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,040
On the table

534
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
Too cold and too hard

535
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,000
You won't even taste it

536
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,240
Are you afraid that my cooking won't taste good

537
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,760
It took a long time to learn

538
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,120
Or say

539
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,720
You think this is a waste of time

540
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,040
How is it

541
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,960
Delicious

542
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,760
Which master is so powerful

543
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,600
Teach you

544
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,720
Why do you cook this dish

545
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,440
Most common

546
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
But it is the most special

547
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,320
The simplest

548
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,040
Is often the most worthwhile

549
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,320
Concerned about aftertaste

550
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,200
The smell of fireworks in the world

551
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,720
But it is the most memorable

552
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,040
The smell of fireworks in the world

553
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,920
But ordinary

554
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,520
Will be ignored

555
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,400
Not to be cherished

556
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,640
Easily available

557
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,440
Will be regarded as a habit

558
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,560
It is easier to be forgotten and abandoned

559
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,160
Do you believe in ordinary happiness

560
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,000
I believe

561
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,880
Do you believe it

562
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,480
Letter

563
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,760
And

564
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,920
This is not ordinary either

565
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,280
This is an ostrich egg

566
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,520
Don't move

567
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,360
It's no use hiding

568
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,280
The ostrich eggs were eaten anyway

569
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,440
Don't you think there's something missing

570
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,520
It seems to be something missing

571
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,320
Guide

572
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,320
Didn't follow

573
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,480
My hotel money was wasted

574
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,240
Duishudong Hotel

575
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,320
Su Kelan

576
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Total surplus

577
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,520
That

578
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,640
Just a moment, please

579
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,680
I'll have a dress delivered to you

580
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,120
What clothes to send

581
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,720
You don't remember

582
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,000
Why are there reporters

583
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,120
Rain feeding culvert

584
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,880
How can there be a reporter

585
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,640
Didn't you say let's scream

586
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,560
Yu Haoren is not here

587
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,720
All the plans have failed

588
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,280
Why did you call someone here

589
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,840
Forget it, forget it

590
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,320
It's not easy for other journalists

591
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,000
How about this

592
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,920
No, you can't communicate with the hotel

593
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,680
Maybe they can still make a hot search

594
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,960
It would be better to talk about an endorsement

595
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm in

596
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,040
301

597
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,320
Good

598
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,120
That's it

599
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,520
Who threw it under the table for me

600
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,240
Why are you here

601
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,120
These heartless people

602
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,240
Throw myself here

603
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,440
Walk, walk

604
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,720
Right oh

605
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,520
Why are there so many reporters

606
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,560
Duishudong Hotel

607
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
I asked you why you have a reporter

608
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,000
How should I know

609
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,160
You suspect I called the reporter

610
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,840
You think I'm setting you up

611
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,360
Let the reporters photograph us

612
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,520
What am I trying to do

613
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,800
To blackmail you

614
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,280
Will your personality be threatened

615
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,520
If I really do this,

616
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,000
You can only fire me, okay

617
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,560
You're not

618
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,440
Do you think your director of public relations

619
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,480
Is it that stupid

620
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,440
I have a proposal

621
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,080
Diamond

622
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,160
Silly woman

623
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,280
Pull and kiss

624
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,160
Don't let people go

625
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,920
He also said that someone else set up the bureau

626
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,920
What are you talking about

627
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,160
I said

628
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,920
I didn't expect Yu Zong's wine

629
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,600
So bad

630
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,200
Who left last yesterday

631
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,200
And

632
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,680
How did I get there

633
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,720
The table went under

634
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,840
I said, do you want to die?

635
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,200
Wait for me

636
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,680
There are reporters outside

637
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,200
That's not true

638
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,480
That's the room

639
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,760
Come here

640
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Why don't you wait for the reporter to go first

641
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,640
No, I have a meeting today

642
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,600
Where are my clothes

643
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,880
I washed the clothes

644
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Washed

645
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,920
You

646
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
Why don't you wear this first

647
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,280
Direct wear

648
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
All right, let's not tease you

649
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,320
I have something more important to tell you

650
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,520
Flash marriage

651
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,040
Are you out of your mind

652
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,440
The man you just met yesterday

653
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,960
You're not because of a dream

654
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
Yelling and tooting about it

655
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,920
Have you divided several

656
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,240
You're still married this time

657
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,640
Aren't you afraid that after she hears it

658
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,600
Divorce you, big brother

659
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,280
Doodle

660
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,800
Doodle

661
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,240
Doodle

662
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,280
Who is Dudu

663
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,000
I panicked at that time

664
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,080
Although I know she

665
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,960
Probably won't believe it

666
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,440
But I explained it to her anyway

667
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,800
I told you when I was a kid

668
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,840
No one gave me a birthday

669
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,640
I ran away from home

670
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,720
By a little girl's family

671
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,400
Take in

672
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,680
When eating at her house,

673
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
We watched it together

674
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,960
"China's Little Master"

675
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,720
Eat together

676
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,840
And then

677
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,480
I'll call that girl

678
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,280
Doodle

679
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,960
Doodle

680
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,520
Doodle

681
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
And then

682
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,080
Guess what

683
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,440
No way

684
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,000
You've known each other since you were kids

685
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,720
Do you think it's interesting

686
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,920
The one found it on the side of the road

687
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Will only tell me

688
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,680
My big fool for my birthday today

689
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,200
It turned out to be Gong Wenxing

690
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,280
Is there fate

691
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,360
Such a coincidence

692
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,120
Not fate

693
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,280
And what is it

694
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,160
This fate has come

695
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,200
You can't stop it if you want to

696
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,320
Fate has come

697
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,360
Don't hide

698
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,680
Su Kelan

699
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,800
I didn't expect Yu Zong's wine

700
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,600
So bad

701
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,520
Good morning

702
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,400
Good morning

703
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,360
Good morning

704
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Early early

705
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,440
Go to work again

706
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,320
Yu Zongzao

707
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,200
Yu Zongzao

708
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,240
Yu Zongzao

709
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,080
Feed that

710
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,360
What is the situation

711
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,920
Yu's meeting is ready

712
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,720
Is there a meeting

713
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,360
Good

714
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,880
Hosted by Sister Kelan of the Public Relations Department

715
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,280
Cancellation of meeting

716
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,520
Good Yu Zong

717
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,480
Yu Zong

718
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,560
This week's public opinion

719
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,040
Just send me a message

720
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,080
Ah

721
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,000
To

722
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,520
What's the situation today, Mr. Yu

723
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,880
The first time I saw him stop like this

724
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,800
I don't find anyone to hold a meeting

725
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,400
And don't swear

726
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,760
Right

727
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,800
And this morning

728
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,880
I didn't even get on the elevator

729
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,680
What's the situation

730
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,600
I have no idea

731
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,600
It's all your fault

732
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,080
I jumped into the Yangtze River

733
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,800
I can't even wash it

734
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,800
It's the Yellow River

735
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,440
I want you to take care of it

736
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,600
It's not the hotel you said you were going to

737
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
If you hadn't drunk too much,

738
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,360
Drill under the table

739
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,880
Why open the door so fast

740
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,360
Guide

741
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,000
Theme of the next program

742
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,840
When will it come out

743
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,880
I asked Mr. Yu to prepare in advance

744
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,080
Su Kelan

745
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,640
Like her

746
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,400
Just like you

747
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,320
How to chase girls

748
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,560
What does it matter to you

749
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,760
I want to chase Yu Hao

750
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,480
You're going after Su Kelan

751
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,680
Then you're going to catch up

752
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,400
Won't it be a big help for me

753
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,280
Take advantage of work

754
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,120
Ask her out to talk about the show

755
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,160
Talk about work

756
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,960
There is no increase in contact

757
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,760
Is there a chance

758
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
OK, I'll make an appointment now

759
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,840
Not right now

760
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,080
What time is it now

761
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,600
You're going out now

762
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,880
Why do you want to talk a few words

763
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,000
Wait until dusk

764
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,360
Why don't we just drop by

765
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,440
Have you had dinner yet

766
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,360
Go

767
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,880
What for

768
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,120
Buy you two clothes

769
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,760
Ugly to death

770
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,200
Are you sure it's ugly

771
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,960
Feed Mengmeng

772
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,040
What happened to your nephew

773
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,240
Hiding from Colan all the time

774
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
I thought that when the president

775
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,760
What courage is there

776
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,280
I didn't expect it to be so unintelligent

777
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,640
That's called purity

778
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,600
It's a good thing

779
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,240
Besides, with us here

780
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,760
I'm afraid they won't work

781
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:08,560
Xiao Hei

782
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,440
Xiao Hei

783
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,000
Can't you get down

784
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,040
Climb up if you can't get down

785
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
I won't come down next time

786
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,200
But nobody saved you

787
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,240
Yu Zong

788
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,120
You

789
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,040
Can you get off

790
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,880
Come down

791
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,040
Do you need any help

792
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,360
No need

793
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,720
Wait a minute

794
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,720
Pick up the cat for me first

795
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:31,800
Good

796
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,600
Yu Zong

797
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,120
Slow down

798
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,080
Be careful

799
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,720
You get up quickly

800
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,080
You

801
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,360
Did you flash your waist

802
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,400
Yu Zong

803
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,720
Go to the hospital and have a look

804
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:53,840
No need

805
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,480
Let's make a film

806
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,760
In case you hurt your bones and muscles

807
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,760
Active

808
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,560
It should be okay

809
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,800
What if there is any problem

810
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,040
There are so many in case

811
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,200
I often take my mother to the hospital

812
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,720
I saw a man last time

813
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,840
I'm only in my twenties

814
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,200
I got hurt playing basketball

815
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,320
I didn't take it seriously at first

816
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,640
Later, when I went home,

817
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,520
Again, the sprain is aggravated

818
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,360
Can't even get up

819
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,760
I haven't recuperated for half a year

820
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,240
Don't look at minor injuries

821
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,960
In case it gets worse

822
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,400
That won't waste time

823
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,160
Does it affect work

824
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,440
What for

825
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,320
Now make up a joke to scare me

826
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,880
It's not made up

827
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,800
I care about your health

828
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,720
I said it's okay

829
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,760
Do you miss me so much

830
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,520
Xiao Yan

831
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,280
Would you please

832
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,760
Send Yu Zong to the hospital

833
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,960
I still have to leave in advance

834
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,400
Okay, Sister Kelan

835
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,480
Yu Zong

836
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,480
Let's go to the hospital

837
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,720
What hospital to go to

838
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,240
Said it was okay

839
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,600
She's the boss. I'm the boss

840
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,920
It's so stiff

841
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,800
You always speak so stiffly

842
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,640
Don't you know

843
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,480
Your breath suddenly softened

844
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,120
How strange it is to be melodramatic again

845
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,960
Su Kelan is so scheming

846
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,680
She saw at a glance that something was fishy

847
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,880
She's not coming

848
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,760
Say who is scheming

849
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,200
My mind

850
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,560
So trust me, okay

851
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,120
As soon as she sends a message, you will reply in seconds

852
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,440
Isn't it too fall in price

853
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,640
Anyway, your hair will be later

854
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,120
It has to be done

855
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,520
Just say you didn't see it in the meeting just now

856
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,480
It's just too late

857
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,560
Have dinner directly

858
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,880
Let me make an appointment with the restaurant for you

859
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,560
That

860
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,920
Send a message without returning it

861
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,640
Do you feel impolite

862
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,360
She is unhappy

863
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,800
I also need my hair done

864
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,520
Could it be too late

865
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,520
You are really capable, born to be single

866
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,160
Almost

867
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,840
Hurry up

868
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,040
Take care of your outfit

869
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,080
Why do you think today is such a coincidence

870
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,080
I want to discuss the best man

871
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,720
She wants to discuss the bridesmaids

872
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,320
Everyone got together

873
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,440
Drink water, drink water

874
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,920
Oh, by the way

875
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,720
I'd like to formally introduce you

876
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,720
Han Meng

877
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,000
My wife

878
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:00,880
Yu Hao

879
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,840
My nephew

880
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,440
Yu Zonghao

881
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,800
Total what total

882
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,520
You're his aunt now

883
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,760
What about this one? I was born

884
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,560
Best friend

885
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,280
Su Kelan

886
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,560
This is my husband

887
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,200
Gong Wenxing

888
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,840
Thank you

889
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,160
Thank you for what

890
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,960
Thank you for sending fat intestines

891
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,040
Trivial matter

892
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,240
Eliminate human scum

893
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,080
Everyone is responsible

894
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,240
Besides

895
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,080
You want to thank

896
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,400
You thank him

897
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,200
He asked me to send it

898
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,040
Don't know what you're talking about

899
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,560
The one with a stomachache

900
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,960
I'll go for a while.

901
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,800
What's wrong with you

902
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,800
Let me accompany you

903
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,200
Dream

904
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,400
Your waist

905
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,800
It's all right

906
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm suddenly in a hurry

907
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,880
Let's go first

908
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,240
Are you avoiding me on purpose

909
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,800
Why are you avoiding me

910
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,600
No, ah

911
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,200
I

912
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,160
It's really urgent

913
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,480
Yu Zong

914
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,560
I didn't expect anything

915
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,560
We're just normal

916
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,120
Subordinate relationship at work

917
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,440
Looking for you in the company to talk about work

918
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,480
Advise you to go to the hospital

919
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,200
Is concerned about the health of the president

920
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,800
I hope you can also rationally and professionally

921
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,560
Handle relationships

922
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,680
Face the problem

923
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,400
What's irrational

924
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,720
They are really

925
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,520
What the hell

926
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,280
Elder sister

927
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,320
Elder sister

928
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,720
We just

929
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,760
Ordinary working relationship

930
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,840
Don't think too much about it

931
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,640
And don't get me wrong

932
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,720
And don't deliberately

933
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,680
They put us together

934
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,480
You keep doing this

935
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,600
I won't be your maid of honor

936
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,760
This pair

937
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,600
Why is it so difficult to stew

938
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,360
The next program is a bit complicated

939
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,040
Let's discuss it together

940
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,680
It's getting late, too

941
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,160
Give me your cell phone

942
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,920
What's the rush

943
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,080
You haven't done your hair yet

944
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,960
Can't eat hot sweet potatoes in a hurry

945
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,440
Tofu

946
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,200
It's all the same

947
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,320
You can eat sweet potatoes

948
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,560
Su Kelan

949
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Give it to me give it to me

950
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,040
What are you hanging up on

951
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,640
You woman

952
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,400
Do you have any brains

953
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,880
You have to let the other party worry first

954
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,480
Three minutes

955
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,480
Give me three minutes

956
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,080
She will definitely give you a WeChat back

957
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,440
Jin Dao

958
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,360
Excuse me

959
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,560
I am busy with a meeting today

960
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,320
Can't get out

961
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,480
Things about work

962
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,760
When do you think it's convenient for you

963
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,400
Make an appointment

964
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,560
I'll call you again

965
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,320
What about chasing girls

966
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,600
It's about patience and endurance

967
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,560
Lu Xun also said

968
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,840
Failure is success

969
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:17,920
Mom

970
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,240
Come back

971
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:33,880
Mom

972
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,600
Are you hungry

973
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,840
I'll go shopping first

974
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,120
No need

975
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,080
You said you'd be back late

976
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,600
I have bought all the food and prepared it

977
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,440
Go get dressed

978
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,720
Today I cook

979
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,200
Mom

980
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,760
Can you really do it

981
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,720
No problem

982
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,600
You leave it alone

983
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,600
Just sit and wait

984
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,040
Let's have doubles noodles today

985
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,240
Doubles noodles

986
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,320
People need to rest

987
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,640
The stomach should also rest

988
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,840
Occasionally, it's simple

989
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,880
Next side

990
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,680
Give yourself a holiday

991
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,480
Mom

992
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,800
I'm not tired

993
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,040
The mood should also have a holiday

994
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,640

995
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,280
Pour vegetable oil

996
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,880

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,240
Add minced meat

998
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,120
Mom

999
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,720
I'm hungry

1000
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,840
Can't wait for you

1001
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,400
I'll do it

1002
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,000

Add a spoonful of oil and mix well

1010
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,920
After cooking

1011
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,560
It is easier to fry meat

1012
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,360
Chopped meat and fried in a pan to dry water

1013
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,960

00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,920
Stir-fry evenly

1023
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,640
Add a small amount of bone soup

1024
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,240
Wait until the soup is thick

1025
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,360
You can come out of the pot

1026
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,200
Doubles noodles

1027
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,800
There are two kinds of toppings

01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,680
Fry the regular dry shame at home

01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,520
Sprinkle with chopped green onion

1032
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,520
Particularly delicious

1033
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,760
Smell

1034
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,240
Fragrant bar

1035
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,840
Cook together

1036
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,080
Have dinner together

1037
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,200
This kind of life

1038
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,400
Life

1039
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,440
Will not be tired

1040
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,800
To be able to enjoy it together

1041
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,200
Such a simple leisure person

1042
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,720
Where are you

1043
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,280
Yu always went to the hospital to have a look

1044
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,800
Let's make a film

1045
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,360
In case you hurt your bones and muscles

1046
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,120
In case it gets worse

1047
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,440
That won't waste time

1048
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,480
Does it affect work

1049
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,920
I'm okay

1050
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,560
Thank you

1051
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,160
Send me this week's public opinion report

1052
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,080
A man who can only work all his life

1053
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,440
Will you understand the meaning of leisure

1054
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,320
Probably not

1055
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,560
Is that all right

1056
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,520
Are you satisfied

1057
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,000
It's time for dinner

1058
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,160
Did you get an injection

1059
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:28,920
Yes, I did

1060
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,200
Where's the report

1061
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:54,880
Let you send it

1062
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,080
Why haven't you sent it out yet

1063
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,560
It's going to take 24 hours

1064
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,680
Handle work at any time

1065
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,560
Colan

1066
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,560
You Yu Zong

1067
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,160
Take a look at the work group

1068
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,200
It has been sent out

1069
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,320
I asked you to send it

1070
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,680
You just let someone else send it

1071
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,720
As the manager of the public relations department,

1072
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,560
Need to distribute work reasonably

1073
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,520
Besides, Yao Qian's report

1074
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,120
Well done

1075
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,680
Worth being seen by the boss

1076
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,760
Encourage commendation

1077
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,280
Ask the boss to face the work rationally

1078
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,360
Don't get emotional

1079
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,560
People are against me

1080
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,360
You're against me, too

1081
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:32,760
Right

1082
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,440
I don't know if I stop water supply

1083
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,320
Give advance notice

1084
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,440
What kind of property

1085
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,000
Your nephew

1086
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,640
What the hell is his problem

1087
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,320
You said the way he looked at Colan

1088
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,560
That is clearly like

1089
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,560
Then why do you hide when you like him?

1090
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,120
He is just too pure

1091
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,720
Eat it

1092
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,920
Hello, the subscriber you dialed is temporarily

1093
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,720
Hello, the subscriber you dialed

1094
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,480
There is no answer for the time being

1095
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,200
Please dial again later

1096
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,520
Hello Angie

1097
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,560
Sister Kelan

1098
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,880
I'm always with you

1099
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,640
Do you record the program

1100
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:02,840
No, ah

1101
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,080
What's the matter

1102
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:04,920
It's like this

1103
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,200
The marketing department has a contract to sign

1104
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,040
Tonight

1105
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,160
I have to let Mr. Yu confirm it

1106
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,840
But I called him several times

1107
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,680
He didn't answer

1108
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,320
He won't answer his phone

1109
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,280
Mom's okay

1110
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:31,680
You eat

1111
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,400
Could something have happened

1112
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,120
He

1113
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,880
My waist flashed before

1114
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,120
Hello, Sister Colan

1115
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,280
Hello Xiaoyan

1116
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,560
After Yu Zong went downstairs from Chrysanthemum,

1117
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,320
Where did you go

1118
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,280
I've already sent Mr. Yu home

1119
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,160
Could you please give me his home address

1120
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:10,760
Send it to me

1121
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,920
Mom, I'll go out for a minute

1122
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,360
You haven't finished your noodles yet

1123
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:15,960
Don't eat

1124
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,240
Hello

1125
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,720
Hey, where are you

1126
01:08:59,280 --> 01:08:59,880
At home

1127
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,200
You're at home

1128
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,840
Did you hear the doorbell

1129
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,840
Hear it

1130
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,400
Hear it

1131
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,560
Why don't you open the door

1132
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,440
Can't move

1133
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,520
What's the matter with you? What's the matter

1134
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,080
Be seriously hurt

1135
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,080
What's your home password

1136
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,560
You tell me

1137
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,560
I'll come in first

1138
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,880
No need

1139
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,680
Why don't you go back first

1140
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,040
Hey, what's wrong with Colan

1141
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,080
Feed Mengmeng

1142
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,600
What's Gong Wenxing's telephone number

1143
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,320
You give it to me

1144
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,760
He's next to me

1145
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,120
Colan

1146
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,400
Hello

1147
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,480
Hello Gong Wenxing

01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,600
Your nephew is injured

1150
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,360
I'm in front of his house now

1151
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:47,840
I can't get in

1152
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,880
The password of his family

1153
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,120
Would it be convenient for you to give it to me

1154
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,200
What

1155
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,920
The password is 408129

1156
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,680
You go in first

1157
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,360
I'll be with you right away

1158
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:54,960
Walk, walk

1159
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,640
What's the matter

1160
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,160
Yu Zong

1161
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,280
How did you get in here

1162
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,640
I'm coming in

1163
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,400
Don't you come in
