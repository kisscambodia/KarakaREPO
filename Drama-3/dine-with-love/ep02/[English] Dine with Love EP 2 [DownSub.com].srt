97
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
You are a responsible person

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,520
Unexpectedly

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
You don't need to know, do you

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,520
And I've been working overtime all day

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm not dereliction of duty

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
I assure you

109
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160

I'll come back and give you an explanation

111
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,480
Never affect work

112
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
After you lose your job,

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,200
There is plenty of time to go home and cook

114
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Now I let you

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,240
Call the program group immediately

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,800
I forged your chat records

117
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Is inappropriate

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
But it can alleviate

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,720
You and the program group

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,200
A way to accumulate grievances for a long time

121
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,560
I understand that you are angry

122
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,320
But the result is good

123
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,240
Are you going to put

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,200
The venting of one's emotions

125
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,880
Before the interests of the company

126
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Call immediately

127
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,840

129
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,520
And I still speak for you

130
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,740
The weak talk about human feelings

131
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,370
To be strong is to master your career

132
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,650
Instead of mastering the kitchen

133
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,870
Work is for a better life

134
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,070
I don't need a working machine to guide my life

135
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,350
If you lose your job, you can have time to go home and cook

136
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,790
Then I will resign now

137

What's the matter, Big Brother

200
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,240

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Let me accompany you

202
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,720
Do you know that

203
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,400
I'll be with you for a minute

204
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
How much money will it delay me

205
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm busy now

206
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,000
Will you stop it

207
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,200
Hang up. Busy

208

[Su Kelan]

210
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,440
The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable

Anjie

212
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,840
Ask the personnel department to put Su Kelan's

213
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,640
Send me your home address

214
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,720
Feel free to eat

215
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,120
Good

Son

217
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,920
Look, your face has lost weight

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
Thank you, Mom

219
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
I said Colan

220
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,680
It's really amazing

221
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Wuneng Company was promoted to director

222
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,160
Wenneng Kitchen cooks well

223
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,320
It's better to eat at home

224
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,640
It's clean and delicious

225
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,280
Isn't it

226
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,440
So the restaurant you went to last night

227
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,200
Isn't it clean

228
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,480
Stop it

229
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,400
The fat intestines were not washed clean

230
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,600
Not bashful to give it away

231
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,160
One free or two boxes

232
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
It's disgusting

233
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,240
Yesterday

234
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,800
Aren't you still in Chengdu

235
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,760
Haven't you come back yet

236
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,560
It was my mother last night

237
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,680
Brought back fat intestines

238
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,280
I had a bad stomach at noon

239
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,760
I have a comment here

240
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,520
It's interesting, huh

241
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,760
A pair of the best mother and son

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,880
I have a girlfriend still dating in the store

243
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
From the store by yourself

244
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
I took two portions of fat intestines

245
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400
It's too greedy to eat and support

246
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,080
That's because we

247
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Give bad reviews to merchants

248
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,400
He deliberately hacked ours

Deliberately black

Can be made up so specifically

251
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,640
And I saw you

252
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,920
What do you see

253
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,800
You have a bad temper

254
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
What do you want to see

255
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,400
You're not rushing up

256
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,760
I want to know that you are going on a blind date

257
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll slap you when I come up

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,920
I didn't

259
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,280
Su Kelan is my girlfriend

260
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
You're not my girlfriend

261
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,320
What are you blending in with

262
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,720
Li Zhi, I tell you

263
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,920
Colan grew up with me

264
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,480
I think of her as my own sister

265
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,720
This thing today

266
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Why don't you make it clear to me

267
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
I won't do it

268
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,000
Colan

269
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,920
You told Han Meng to stop blending in

270
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
She doesn't trust me

271
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't you trust me yet

272
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Then you put the ticket back today

273
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
Show me

274
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,480
Ticket

275
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Throw it away

276
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,120
You calculate the tolerance back and forth

277
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,360
Tickets can be reimbursed

278
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,920
You just throw it away

279
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,280
It's not much money either

280
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,800
I just didn't care too much

281
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,600
You dig like that

282
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,080
Even your mother eats

283
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Have to run to Colan's house

284
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,560
People who come to rub

285
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,880
You will be willing to lose your ticket

286
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,240
Rubbing rice

287
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,480
What do you mean

288
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,600
Say I rub rice

289
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,120
The delicious food outside now

290
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,800
There are plenty

291
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,400
It is also convenient to order takeout

292
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:29,920
Right here

293
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,920
Right here

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,080
Dishes that can't be served on the table

295
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,440
When I like to eat

296
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,240
If I hadn't looked at it

297
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,280
My son's face

298
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm not coming to eat

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
What are you talking about

300
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,520
Do you like to come or not

301
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,800
Who forced you

302
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Mom, don't say that

303
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,760
The somebody else can Lan is also a piece

304
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,200
Li Xun

305
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,000
You put last night's events

306
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,680
Make it clear

307
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
If you can't prove it

308
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,080
You were in Chengdu last night

309
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,520
Then please and your mother

310
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,880
Never condescend again

311
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,200
Come to my house for dinner

312
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,800
Colan

313
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,400
Why don't you trust me

314
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,440
You are like this

315
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,920
I'm really hurt

316
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,720
Li Xun

317
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,560
What are you talking nonsense about with them

318
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,520
Why should I explain it

319
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,240
You are a medicine jar

320
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,480
Diabetes mellitus and renal failure

321
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
Life depends on dialysis and money

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,920
My son didn't give up

323
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,640
Your drag bottle

324
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,360
And with your daughter

325
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,600
After talking for so long

326
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,840
What else should I cooperate with you

327
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
Like family

328
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,520
I also want to eat together

329
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,160
Pull me here

330
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
Play your family every day

331
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,120
Make you happy

332
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,520
We've done so much for you

333
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,760
I haven't asked for companionship fee yet

334
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
You're questioning my son

335
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,600
Aunt Ma Su

336
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,080
What are you doing

337
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,240
I'm okay

338
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,520
You guys go

339
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,280
Aunt Su is really sorry

340
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
Just now, my mother was outspoken

341
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,560
Colan

342
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,240
In this way

343
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,560
I'll take my mom home first

344
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,600
When you calm down,

345
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,440
Calm down

346
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm calm

347
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,160
Then you believe me

348
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,720
I want to believe you

349
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
But I'm calm

350
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,040
So I don't believe you

351
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,080
Unless you can produce evidence

352
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,880
Make me believe

353
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
Can you

354
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,880
What do you mean, Su Kelan

355
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
You're just because of your best friend

356
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,520
A few words of gossip

357
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,320
You don't trust me

358
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
Pressing me here

359
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,040
You don't look at it either

360
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,640
How good I am to you

361
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,440
You dragged a sick mother

362
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,520
If I don't like you

363
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,360
What do I want

364
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm with you

365
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
What do I want to call every day

366
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,840
Sing to you

367
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
Let my mother come over every day

368
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,680
Eat dinner with you

369
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,000
Why are you so tired every week

370
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,240
I have to come and accompany you

371
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,000
You are a good craftsman

372
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,280
Or is your home environment good

373
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,040
None of them

374
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Isn't it just to make you happy

375
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,240
So

376
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,880
You eat my cooking

377
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,800
Or give me alms

378
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,960
Or else

379
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,000
You

380
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:07,960
You

381
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,560
How dare you pour water on me

382
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,360
What are you doing

383
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,080
It's killing me. My leg

384
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,360
Colan, are you all right

385
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,800
Why are you walking away

386
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm not

387
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,440
I didn't do it on purpose

388
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,440
I've always chosen to believe

389
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,720
Simple

390
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,480
It is most worthy of care and aftertaste

391
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,960
But the happiness that was easily obtained

392
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,040
Will really be taken for granted

393
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,720
The easiest to forget

394
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
And abandonment

395
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,160
Are you a man

396
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,240
You still do it

397
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,840
Stop arguing

398
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
What does it matter to you

399
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Mengmeng Mengmeng

400
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,120
Calm down and calm down

401
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,040
All right

402
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,600
Mengmeng is ready

403
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,440
Calm down and calm down

404
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,760
Mengmeng is calm

405
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,160
What does it have to do with you

406
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,680
Yu Zong

407
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
Mengmeng, come on

408
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,280
Colan

409
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:14,920
Get up quickly

410
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,520
Yu Zong

411
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,040
How do you do

412
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,880
I am Chengdu Branch

413
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,800
The staff of the marketing department

414
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,320
My name is Li Xun

415
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,040
My son Li Xun

416
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,280
"What to Eat" Chengdu Company

417
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,360
Marketing Director

418
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,880
Work is extremely busy

419
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,440
Director of Chengdu Marketing Department

420
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,040
It's you

421
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,200
The director is my effort

422
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,120
Objectives of work

423
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,360
Very good

424
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
The company needs to be like you

425
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,720
An energetic person

426
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,280
Thank you, Mr. Yu

427
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,200
I will do my best

428
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,680
That's right

429
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,440
Users in Chengdu

430
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,000
Which groups do they come from

431
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,560
Young people

432
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,600
What is the proportion of each age group

433
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,080
This

434
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,080
This depends on that data

435
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,080
I can't remember exactly

436
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
Click conversion this quarter

437
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,600
Collection transformation

438
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,160
What are the shopping cart conversions

439
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,440
Mr. Yu, please wait a moment

440
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,560
I'll take a look at the report

441
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,480
It's all in the report

442
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,280
Accurate analysis of target consumers

443
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
Give the best

444
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,760
Marketing plan

445
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,280
Accurate access and effective transformation

446
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,760
It is the responsibility of your marketing department

447
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,200
And you

448
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Even the most basic data

449
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,160
I can't answer it

450
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,240
Do you think you are competent

451
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,600
Yu Zong mine

452
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,200
Go to the personnel department by yourself tomorrow

453
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,240
Yu Zong

454
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,520
Colan

455
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
Yu Zong

456
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,440
What are you doing in my house

457
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
Is this the way you work

458
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
This is my home

459
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,920
My personal affairs, my family and friends

460
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,840
Does it have anything to do with you

461
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,280
How is your boss

462
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,080
Come here to fire you

463
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
Are you kidding me

464
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,280
Or

465
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
Catch up and ask

466
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,960
Explain, explain

467
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,840
Mom, you leave me quiet for a while

468
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Can you do it?

469
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,240
Wait till Colan comes back

470
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,320
Why are some people still here

471
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,280
Don't go

472
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,160
I see

473
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,280
Is to see Colan

474
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
Can talk to Yu Zong

475
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,960
Want to wait for her to come back

476
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,440
Let her intercede for help

477
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,040
Mengmeng, don't say that

478
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,560
Kelan was almost crying just now

479
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,440
How could I leave without her

480
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
You're her best friend

481
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,240
She'll be back later

482
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
Let's talk to her together

483
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,200
Who said anything about you just now

484
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,040
It's none of my business

485
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,600
Besides

486
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,680
Colan doesn't need it at all

487
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,480
You comfort

488
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,480
You don't need to condescend to accompany her to dinner

489
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,840
Handsome than you

490
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,920
People who are more successful than you

491
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,280
Lots of love for Colan

492
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,760
Chasing Kelan

493
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,040
It's not

494
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,320
They all chased home

495
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,560
Mengmeng

496
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,320
You just said

497
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,240
Tell me about that

498
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,880
Their boss

499
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,800
Yeah

500
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,920
He's been chasing Colan for a long time

501
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,520
You still think of him as a friend, don't you

502
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,400
What for

503
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,280
Intercede for him

504
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,720
I see you women fall in love

505
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,440
You have no brains

506
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
Then you break in at will

507
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,080
Home of departing employees

508
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,320
Is there a brain

509
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
You said you were leaving this afternoon

510
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,040
It's because of your personal affairs

511
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,320
Today is not a working day either

512
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,080
Use of your private time

513
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't need to ask

514
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,640
Likewise

515
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,000
I am the boss of the company

516
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,920
Who do I fire

517
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,360
Where to fire

518
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,040
Why the dismissal

519
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,160
You don't need to tell someone

520
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,880
Terminated employee

521
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
Inexplicable

522
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,720
Pick a man on time next time

523
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,280
What are you talking about

524
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
Have the ability to say it again

525
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,840
So what if I say it again

526
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,160
Is Su Kelan cheating

527
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Who cheated

528
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,680
Do you believe it or not

529
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,160
I went to your company to pull banners

530
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,600
Let everyone know

531
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,920
That is to dog men and women

532
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,640
Nonsense

533
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,840
Why are you such a scoundrel

534
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,920
Li Xun

535
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,560
You

536
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,240
Mom

537
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,280
All right

538
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,880
The food is gone

539
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,560
You don't have to stay at my house anymore

540
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,880
Colan, listen to me

541
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,680
It's all a misunderstanding

542
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,600
Is it a misunderstanding

543
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,880
I'll find out

544
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,920
You climb the high branch and you

545
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
Aunt Wang

546
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
If you want to pull the banner

547
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,680
Just go

548
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,080
But the company has a system and legal affairs

549
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,800
If you have excessive behavior,

550
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,240
Action may be taken

551
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,920
Previously, it was owned by the company

552
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,280
The precedent of the dismissal of employees to make trouble

553
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Eventually sentenced

554
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,600
Compensation for Yu Zong's reputation loss

555
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,880
If libel is also involved

556
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,440
May face less than three years

557
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,280
Criminal proceedings

558
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,440
You

559
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,760
You threaten people

560
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
Not a threat

561
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,920
Is to prompt risks

562
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,680
Inform past cases

563
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,840
Your son used to be

564
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,080
The employees of our company

565
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,000
You can ask him

566
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,920
Am I telling the truth

567
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,240
Colan, I'm sorry

568
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,960
That everyone today

569
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,640
Everyone is a little impulsive

570
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,160
Your anger subsided later

571
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,120
We'll find you again

572
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,840
Go and go

573
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,800
Colan, are you all right

574
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,920
Nothing

575
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,280
Mom

576
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Mom sit down

577
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,360
Are you all right

578
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,320
Colan

579
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,800
Did you hurt yourself just now

580
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,640
No

581
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,480
Are you all right

582
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,000
Nothing

583
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,600
Nothing

584
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,800
Find the personnel department by yourself tomorrow

01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,040
Miss the most accustomed one

1163
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,320
But the most special warmth

1164
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
Why does this sound a little sad

1165
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,880
If you can cherish it

1166
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,000
You don't have to be sad

1167
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,880
I hope we can all cherish it

1168
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,560
The one around me

1169
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,040

You have to call me here

1181
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,720
What if there is any problem

1182
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,160
Multiple people and multiple helpers

1183
01:00:59,160 --> 01:00:59,920
It's always true

1184
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,160
It's you

1185
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,760
It's really completely okay

1186
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,640

We are also afraid that you will misunderstand

1193
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,480
I didn't say

1194
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,640
Why don't I go to your house and apologize

01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,400
I dare to let my parents

1203
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Fall to the ground with heart disease

1204
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,000
Extort money from him

1205
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,640
Shameless

1206
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,960

Can you teach me to beat eggs with one hand

1209
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,840
There is a lot of teaching on the Internet

1210
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,840
Buy more eggs

1211
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,040

It's not necessary, is it

1254
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,200
A waste of time

1255
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,160
After all, there were some grievances before

1256
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,040
Eating a meal can relieve it

1257
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,760
Who is that woman

1258
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,080

1259
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,760
Still so familiar with the crew

After the work is finished,

Don't we all have dinner together

1289
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,120
Just do it as a routine

1290
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,440
