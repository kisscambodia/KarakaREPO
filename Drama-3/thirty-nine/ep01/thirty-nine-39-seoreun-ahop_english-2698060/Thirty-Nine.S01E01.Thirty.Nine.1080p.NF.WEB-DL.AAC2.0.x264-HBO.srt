00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,015
<i><font color="white">We're 39 years old.</font></i>

2
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,433
<i><font color="white">We met when we were 18.</font></i>

3
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,354
<i><font color="white">And now, we're at an age
where getting a massage feels amazing.</font></i>

4
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,231
You're not breaking my bones, right?

5
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,444
<i><font color="white">When we were 18,
we'd hang out and eat</font></i> tteokbokki.

6
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,574
<i><font color="white">But who knew we'd be doing
the same thing at the age of 39?</font></i>

7
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,077
<i><font color="white">The only difference is
we drink soju instead of Coke now.</font></i>

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,289
Tteokbokki <i><font color="white">is still
our favorite comfort food.</font></i>

9
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,958
Here. Have this.

10
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,502
Is it good?

11
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,763
BEWARE OF BEES
FOLLOW SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

12
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,432
1:57 P.M.

13
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,101
We need to be careful.

14
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,853
Or else, we'll get hurt.

15
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,397
I sprained my ankle
while golfing yesterday.

16
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,815
Then you can't hike.

17
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,734
Do you want <i><font color="white">baeksuk</font></i>?

18
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,901
-Sure.
-Sure.

19
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,198
<i><font color="white">Ma'am, can we have a bottle of</font></i> makgeolli?

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,910
<i><font color="white">-Nothing has changed</font></i>
-Hey.

21
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,704
<i><font color="white">even though we're almost 40.</font></i>

22
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,916
<i><font color="white">Just that only high-end cosmetics
work on our skin,</font></i>

23

24

25
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,674
<i><font color="white">That's about it.</font></i>

26
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,675
<i><font color="white">It's similar, right?</font></i>

27
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,303
YOUR GOLF BUDDY

28
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,934
Darn it.

29
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:23,852
What's wrong?

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,771
I accidentally pressed like.

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,147
On what?

32
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,565
A friend's pre-wedding photo.

33
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,985
Darn it. This means I'll have
to give them congratulatory money.

34
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,862
Poor you. Why did you do that?

35
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,114
You should really quit social media.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,536
<i><font color="white">We avoid weddings and baby birthdays
since we probably won't have them.</font></i>

37
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,207
<i><font color="white">But we do our best
to attend funerals because we're 39.</font></i>

38
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,959
<i><font color="white">That's what we've become.</font></i>

39
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,044
What's wrong with her?

40
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,504
-Good shot.
-Hey, the feathers.

41
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,630
Darn it.

42
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,800
Hey, do something else.

43
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,155
<i><font color="white">Thankfully, we found our soulmates</font></i>

44
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,241
<i><font color="white">and learned to love passionately.</font></i>

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,786
<i><font color="white">And…</font></i>

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,958
<i><font color="white">after being together for over 20 years,</font></i>

47
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,586
<i><font color="white">we had to say our first goodbyes.</font></i>

48
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:40,178
<i><font color="white">Never in our wildest dreams did we
expect a funeral to be held for one of us</font></i>

49
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,430
<i><font color="white">in our late thirties.</font></i>

50
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,058
<i><font color="white">We laughed…</font></i>

51
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,687
<i><font color="white">and cried a lot.</font></i>

52
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,397
<i><font color="white">This is…</font></i>

53
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,818
<i><font color="white">our passionate story.</font></i>

54
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:02,659
THIRTY, NINE

55
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,953
EPISODE 1

56
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,383
-Yes?
-<i><font color="white">Good morning, Dr. Cha.</font></i>

57
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,927
<i><font color="white">-Are you headed to work?</font></i>
-What's gotten into you?

58
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,263
I should be nice
since I'm getting free treatment.

59
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,349
I never said it was free.
I'm only giving you a discount.

60
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,394
Then I'll pay in 100 installments.

61
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,438
So Chan-young and I can go today, right?

62
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,482
Didn't you already ask that last night?

63
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,816
You're pretty forgetful.

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,319
<i><font color="white">You should call the person
who's even worse than me.</font></i>

65
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,071
Oh, my bus is here. See you later.

66
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,700
JOO-HEE

67
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,007
What?

68
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,968
Hey, don't forget we're visiting
Mi-jo's clinic today. Don't be late.

69
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,346
<i><font color="white">Did you have to call this early?</font></i>

70
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,014
Of course. Don't be late.

71
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,808
You messed up my day already.

72
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,727
It's your fault if I'm late.

73
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,899
Damn it.

74
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,239
Good morning.

75
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,406
Good morning.

76
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,493
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

77
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,702
Good morning, Dr. Cha.

78
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,120
Good morning.

79
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,166
-Dr. Cha.
-Yes?

80
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,001
-Good morning.
-Hey.

81
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,463
I heard a strange rumor.

82
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,840
And what could that be?

83
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,758
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO
DERMATOLOGIST

84
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,594
I heard we're going
to have a new director.

85
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,389
It's temporary. It'll just be for a year.

86
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,766
And what will you be doing
in the meantime?

87
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,894
I'm going to study abroad.

88
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,022
Studying abroad all of a sudden?

89
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,191
Yes. To play golf.

90
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,611
I'm going to take a one-year sabbatical.

91
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,906
Without my permission?

92
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,659
I worked like a dog
for the past five years.

93
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm going to take a break, get refreshed,
and come back to work.

94
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,542
I'm telling Dad.

95
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,043
Mi-hyeon, come on.

96
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,713
You can't do that
when you just paid off the loan.

97
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,381
That's exactly it.

98
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,092
I think I deserve a break
since I paid it all.

99
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,886
What about my money?
When will you pay me back?

100
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,555
Have you forgotten?

101
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,599
I paid eight <i><font color="white">pyeong</font></i>'s worth
of this clinic.

102
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,851
Then keep the clinic
and pay me every month.

103
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,649
Darn it!

104
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,695
Please don't charge the two women
who are coming this afternoon, Ms. Cha.

105
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,033
I mean Chan-young and Joo-hee.

106
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,744
We're celebrating my sabbatical.
A friendship event.

107
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,789
Gosh. This is infuriating.

108
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,125
I'm so enraged.

109
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,002
It's the menopause.

110
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,046
You're dead meat.

111
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm going to tell Dad
that you've begun to hit me.

112
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,678
You can't do that to your adopted sister.

113
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,685
Why did they have to adopt you,
not someone sweet?

114
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,606
I'm aging faster thanks to you.

115
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,858
Don't blame me
when you're an aging spinster.

116
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,401
Look who's talking.

117
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,153
But I'm not a spinster.

118
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,529
Yes, you are.

119
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,865
No, I'm not.
No one thinks that way about me.

120
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,659
You're going to grow old too.

121
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,927
Are you looking for something?

122
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,845
Yes, serums.

123
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,807
-I see. This way, please.
-Okay.

124
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,644
How is it?

125
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,645
It's nice.

126
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,188
Isn't it very smooth?

127
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,987
Is it already time for my Botox?

128
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,782
It's quite ironic, isn't it?

129
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,785
-What is?
-Look at you.

130
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,913
You, an awful actor, get main roles
solely thanks to your looks.

131
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,624
I'm the reason why you have a job.

132
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,668
You little…

133
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,128
There you go again.

134
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,800
If I hear about your terrible acting
ever again, I'm going to mess you up.

135
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,928
You always threaten me like that.

136
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,348
Will you take care of me if you do that?

137
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,559
That's enough. Open your script.

138
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,356
HOW SHOULD WE INTERPRET CHARACTERS?
NOT ACTIONS, BUT REACTIONS

139
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,525
-Next Wednesday…
-Dr. Cha will be done soon.

140
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,818
-So please wait.
-Goodbye.

141
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,528
-Okay.
-Thank you.

142
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,160
I'm nervous.

143
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,619
Why?

144
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,747
This is my first time.

145
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,791
What? Doesn't everyone know
that you're a virgin?

146
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,752
What? Are you crazy?

147
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,254
I meant this is
my first time getting fillers.

148
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,965
-I see. I thought your virginity--
-Seriously?

149
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,468
Be quiet! Are you crazy?

150
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,808
Do your customers like those products?

151
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,644
-Hey, Mi-hyeon.
-It's been a long time.

152
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,604
How about here?

153
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,147
They do like them.

154
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,817
I see. Are you checking
how your businesses are doing?

155
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,819
-We're just saying hi.
-Goodness.

156
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,574
By the way,
how do you look younger with age?

157
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,159
-I do, right?
-Yes.

158
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,828
Why can't Mi-jo talk sweetly like Joo-hee?

159
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,082
What's wrong? Does she still
make jokes about being adopted?

160
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,875
Only when she's cornered.

161
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,086
That's so cheap, isn't it?

162
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,962
Then undo the adoption.

163
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,048
She's already 39. It's a bit too late.

164
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,969
I'm leaving first.
I hope you guys become prettier.

165
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,554
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

166
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,351
I mean, I'm already pretty enough.

167
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,324
Don't you think Mi-jo has
such a wonderful family?

168
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,367
She does.

169
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,036
No wonder she grew up well.

170
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,498
You tend to blurt out
sincere words at times.

171
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,834
You better not tell her.

172
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,210
You'll only spoil her.

173
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,966
I'm so nervous. Oh, dear.

174
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,843
-Okay. Relax.
-Be gentle.

175
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,678
Give her a good amount.

176
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,263
Make her beautiful.

177
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,056
This feels so weird.

178
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,307
Done?

179
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,478
Hold this to your nose,
but don't add pressure.

180
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,521
Okay.

181
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,692
Hey, do you have
any plastic surgeon friends?

182
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,737
It'll cost a fortune for you.
Don't even dream about it.

183
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,575
That hurt my pride. Hey, I'm perfect.

184
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,493
I meant for Joo-hee.

185
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,080
I thought she could get her eyes done.

186
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,456
Do I have small eyes?

187
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,083
You're just fine.

188
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,210
Don't let her nonsense get to you.

189
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,628
Nonsense?

190
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,839
-It was just a piece of advice.
-Gosh.

191
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,965
Hey.

192
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,217
-Where's the director?
-Can I help you?

193
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,635
-Can I help you?
-Where is she?

194
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,345
-What's going on?
-I have no business with you.

195
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,889
-Call her.
-Did you borrow money?

196
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,058
-Was there a medical accident?
-I want to see her right now!

197
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,060
-One minute, ma'am.
-Where is she?

198
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,979
-Talk to us first.
-Call her over.

199
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,439
-There.
-Now.

200
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,608
-Ma'am--
-What's going on?

201
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,860
-Dr. Cha.
-Is it you?

202
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,986
Are you the director?

203
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:35,987
Who are you?

204
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,575
Me? I'm the wife of Mr. Jeong,
the man you seduced, you wench.

205
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,494
Hey, what's going on?

206
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,705
Hold on. Who's Mr. Jeong?

207
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,708
I knew you'd play dumb.

208
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,003
Hey. We already know it's you,
so you better beg.

209
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,129
Go on.

210
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,175
Who are you to barge
into my clinic and cause a scene?

211
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,343
Scene?

212
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,512
How could you say that after what you did?

213
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,265
You seduced a father of two.

214
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,309
I know he paid for this clinic!

215
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:07,977
What?

216
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,979
Have you gone insane?

217
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,564
I just can't be nice, can I?

218
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,358
Ma'am!

219
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,611
You bitch!

220
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,112

235
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,738
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

236
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,864
Why did you hit them?

237
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,534
-Well, I wasn't going
-Mistake.

238
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,035
-to hit them.
-A mistake.

239
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,037
-It was a misunderstanding.
-It's swollen.

240
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,456
Is this because of the fillers?

241
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,084
No, it's because you got hit.

242
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,461
Hey, you should sue them.

243
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,297
It was a misunderstanding,

244
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,924
so why bother?

245
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,175
You shouldn't.

246
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,761
You once had the wrong idea
and tried to beat me up too.

247
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,472
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,016
What? Did you forget already?

249
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,310
How could you forget?

250
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,478
Right.

251
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,440
You did the same thing before.

252
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,733
Right.

253
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,695
That was ages ago.

254
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,198
Why would you suddenly bring that up?

255
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,162
YEAR 2000

256
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,209
CHA MI-JO

257
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,205
Excuse me.

258
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,998
Did you lose something?

259
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,754
My wallet.

260
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,385
Here.

261
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,970
You have no money.

262
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,393
I'll pay you back.

263
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,853
But why are you talking casually?

264
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,939
Your name tag. You're in 11th grade.

265
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,440
Are you older?

266
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,109
No. I'm also in 11th grade.

267
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,151
I see.

268
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,278
-I'll pay you back.
-It's fine.

269
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,697
I'll just think I helped the needy.

270
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,366
Bye.

271
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,579
Hey! Are you a lunatic?

272
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,956
I'm not in need.

273
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,999
I didn't say you were in need.

274
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,419
But you said you'll think that. Why?

275
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,462
Do I look pitiful? Unfortunate?

276
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,714
Gosh, what a crazy…

277
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,426
Hey, get lost. Just go.

278
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,274
What's her deal?

279
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,571
SILOAM SNACK BAR

280
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:58,624
Are you sure?

281
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,460
Is it her?

282
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,253
Be quiet. She'll hear you.

283
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,723
-Mom.
-Hey, you're back from school.

284
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,184
You should've just
gone straight to the academy.

285
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,685
I came to wash the dishes.

286
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,980
Your dad said he'd arrive soon.
You can go study.

287
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,232
No, I have some free time.
Let me help a bit.

288
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,109
Goodness. It's really fine.

289
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,861
I know you're tired.

290
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,499
Why… Why are you doing this?

291
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,545
Is the owner of that snack bar your mom?

292
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,173
Yes, she is.

293
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,299
What grade are you in?

294
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:49,759
Eleventh grade.

295
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,595
What? Then are you guys twins?

296
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,804
Sorry?

297
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,725
No way. Then she kept one
and gave the other up for adoption?

298
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,810
I'll rip your mouth if you don't shut up.

299
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,981
Both of you are in 11th grade
and have the same mom.

300
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,316
I'm right.

301
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,488
What's going on? What is this all about?

302
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,698
Don't be so scared. We're the same age.

303
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,742
Siloam Snack Bar.

304
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,203
This is the only Siloam Snack Bar
in Gocheok-dong.

305
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,039
Yes. There's just one.

306
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,668
Is she really your birth mom?
Not your stepmom?

307
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,169
Yes, she is.

308
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:29,340
I have photos of me and my parents
from back when I was born.

309
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,635
What is this? A soap opera?

310
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,687
Where do you live? Is it far from here?

311
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,980
I'm from Samseong-dong.

312
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,941
Your adoptive parents must be rich.

313
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,529
They say the owner of Siloam Snack Bar
in Gocheok-dong is your mom?

314
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,825
Then that should be me.

315
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,202
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,334
She visited her orphanage
and saw her files.

317
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,547
She saw your shop's name,
and that's why she thought it was you.

318
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,049
Do you live in an orphanage?

319
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,635
No, I visited. She just explained.

320
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,263
I see. Are you guys friends?

321
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,723
-No.
-I'm her creditor.

322
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,141
Her creditor?

323
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,392
You better pay me back.

324
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,810
I will when my dad gets here.

325
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,658
Mi-jo.

326
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,495
Mom. I'm sorry.

327
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,501
You should've told me.

328
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,423
I would've helped you
find your birth parents.

329
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,093
Thank you.

330
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:00,765
Our daughter would've waited
out on the street if it weren't for you.

331
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,558
Thank you so much.

332
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,976
Don't worry about it.

333
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,610
Who beat up my sister?

334
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,654
Why is Mi-hyeon here?

335
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,905
Darn it.

336
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,700
Well, I was a bit worried,
so I called her.

337
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,118
-Hey!
-I…

338
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,412
-Gosh.
-I was just…

339
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,753
What's with her outfit?

340
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,258
Left. Right. Chin.

341
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,095
Your face is fine. Where did you get hit?

342
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,638
What are you wearing?

343
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,057
Who the hell did this?

344
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,809
Fess up while I'm still being nice.

345
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,560
Goodness.

346
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,647
I'm so sorry.
Her clinic has the same name, so--

347
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,941
Are you the one who beat up my sister?

348
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,403
You must be her older sister.
There was a slight misunderstanding.

349
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,362
I'm terribly sorry.

350
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,280
You're right.

351
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,865
You better be.

352
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,742
-Goodness!
-Mi-hyeon.

353
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,703
-Come on.
-Goodness.

354
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,831
You should've done your research properly

355
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,582
before barging in like that.

356
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,042
Goodness. You're right.

357
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,587
I was so furious. I must've lost my mind.

358
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,381
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

359
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,757
-You're sorry?
-Goodness!

360
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,176
-Mi-hyeon, please.
-As an apology,

361
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,470
how about we bring
our friends to your clinic?

362
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,140
Our online and offline friends
all get Botox these days.

363
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,391
Okay. Thank you.

364
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,059
"Thank you"? Are you serious?

365
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,729
We'll compensate for all damages.

366
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,607
-Definitely.
-Goodness! I'm so sorry.

367
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,859
It's understandable.

368
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,279
Your husband cheated on you.
Of course you'd see red.

369
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,156
Goodness, you're so understanding.

370
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,076
I believe adultery
should be illegal once again.

371
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,286
It's a crime.

372
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,038
Goodness. You're making me feel worse.

373
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,124
I hope you find that bitch.

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,126
Hey.

375
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,628
She beat us up, you know?

376
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,214
I'll take it from here.

377
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,215
Come.

378
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,135
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

379
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,052
Goodness.

380
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,225
This could happen to you too.

381
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,939
That thought crossed my mind too.

382
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,775
When I was getting beaten up,

383
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,610
I thought of you.

384
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,696
Hey. You make it sound like

385
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,824
I'm a mistress or something.

386
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,451
Are you guys serious?

387
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,914
And there's your man.

388
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:31,999
Shut it.

389
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,459
Hello, Jin-seok.

390
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,173
Did you bring your car?

391
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,888
Aren't you guys turning 40 soon?

392
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,725
Who in the world said
you become wiser when you turn 40?

393
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,060
Was it Mencius?

394
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,061
It was Confucius.

395
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,813
Just shut it.

396
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,439
Get up. How did you get here?

397
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,525
-In a police car.
-Good going.

398
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:02,988
Then should we let the man who's having
an affair with Chan-young give us a ride?

399
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,699
Let's just punch her
and compensate her for it.

400
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,412
I don't know how else to describe him.
You know I'm not good with words.

401
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,208
-That hurts.
-Get up this instant.

402
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,754
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

403
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,468
Gosh, what's that?

404
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,763
What the…

405
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,765
What's she wearing?

406
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,017
What's wrong with her?

407
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,312
This evening is full of surprises.

408
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,230
Let's go.

409
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,982
Take your sister's car.

410
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,858
I don't want to ride with you.

411
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,361
A true friend lets you know
what's right or wrong.

412
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,114
Bye. Don't be late tomorrow.

413
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,073
I'm not going.

414
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,368
Do we have to go there
on our precious day off?

415
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,494
Where are you going?

416
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,540
My sister wants to settle this.

417
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,375
But she could still sue you.

418
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,337
If you don't tell us the truth,
we won't let this slide.

419
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,797
I'll take her to the hospital…

420
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,885
Do you do social dancing or something?

421
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,389
You're so ignorant.

422
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,640
It's dancesport.

423
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,351
What kind of outfit is that?

424
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,396
Then why do figure skaters
dress like that?

425
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,481
Do Mom and Dad know?

426
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,819
You're a traitor if you tell them.

427
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,115
If you're ashamed of your hobby,
then there's something wrong with it.

428
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,075
Imagine if Dad saw me in this.

429
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,578
Then you'd become
a bald woman in her mid-forties.

430
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,204
If you know that, don't tell them.

431
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,250
I was going to show off
this outfit today, but I couldn't.

432
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,127
I ended up wearing it to a police station!

433
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,213
I'm so embarrassed by you.

434
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,010
<i><font color="white">The swelling has gone down.</font></i>

435
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,304
Are you hurt anywhere else?

436
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,847
Jin-seok.

437
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,725
Let's call Mi-jo over
and pull out her hair.

438
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,646
She keeps saying
that we're having an affair.

439
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:06,070
That's because she finds it fun
to see you all worked up.

440
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,698
Did she say anything else?

441
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,867
No. Why?

442
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,705
I told her I wouldn't stand still
if she bothered you.

443
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:34,848
What is it?

444
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,687
Jin-seok.

445
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,688
Yes?

446
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,899
Can't you get a divorce?

447
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,365
It's getting late.

448
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,076
Let's go. I'll drop you off. Come on.

449
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,912
I still have work to do.

450
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,123
You can go first.

451
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,962
You can't work in that state.

452
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,005
Just go home. I'll drop you off.

453
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,466
Had I followed you

454
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,469
when you went abroad to study,

455
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,181
would we be married right now?

456
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,860
How about a movie this weekend?

457
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,075
This is exactly why
she says we're having an affair.

458
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,287
It's obvious that you love me,

459
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,457
but we only eat and watch movies.

460
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,591
This is exhausting for me.

461
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,157
Fine.

462
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,160
You get sullen so easily.

463
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,747
Fine. I won't say those things
ever again. I'm sorry.

464
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,417
Okay?

465
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,379
Let's meet this weekend.

466
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,217
I'm so happy.

467
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,366
What is that?

468
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,993
It's a dating app.

469
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,913
Has it ever worked out?

470
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,875
I did have lunch with a guy last week.

471
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,795
How was he?

472
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,714
He was okay.

473
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,009
You should never go
on blind dates in the afternoon.

474
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,761
What was that? Is that a ghost?

475
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,182
You should meet in the evening,
have a light meal,

476
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,227
drink a lot of alcohol,
and sleep together right after.

477
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,564
Goodness. You're all talk.

478
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,607
You're not a teenage girl anymore.

479
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,985
Be honest with yourself.
Don't you agree, Mi-jo?

480
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,363
Scold Chan-young, will you?
What's wrong with her?

481
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,241
She may be crude,

482
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,368
but she has a point.

483
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,580
I just can't get through to you guys.

484
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,332
Gosh. Your minds are in the gutter.

485
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,590
<i><font color="white">Seriously! You guys are nasty.</font></i>

486
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,945
-Me too!
-Me too, please!

487
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,495
This way. This way, please!

488
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,297
Did you sleep well?

489
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,677
Mi-jo is always so happy here.

490
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,471
This place is like her hometown.

491
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:08,997
Ma'am.

492
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,459
Ma'am, could you please…

493
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,053
You can do it.

494
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,600
Do you not like mushrooms?

495
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,559
No?

496
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,312
Have some mushrooms.

497
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,730
-Do you want more meat?
-Yes.

498
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,983
-You don't like mushrooms?
-Enjoy.

499
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,818
-Gosh, it looks good.
-Enjoy.

500
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,944
-Thank you.
-Sure.

501
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,112
All right.

502
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,907
Why aren't you eating?

503
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,200
I did.

504
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,411
You should eat more. Okay?

505
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,038
I'll grill you some delicious meat,
so eat some more. Okay?

506
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,499
-Sausages.
-Have this.

507
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,584
-Do you want some sausages?
-Thank you.

508
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,794
Here.

509
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,797
-Here.
-Thank you.

510
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,674
Who is that?

511
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,056
What a handsome stranger.

512
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,975
Who is he?

513
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,900
-Hey, guys.
-Mr. Kim!

514
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,527
-How have you been?
-Mr. Kim!

515
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,239
Goodness. What were you up to? Let's go.

516
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,532
Oh, dear.

517
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,036
-I forgot about our English class.
-I see.

518
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,330
He must be their English teacher.

519
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,041
I totally forgot.
You're starting today, right?

520
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:34,958
Yes.

521
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,669
Then should we have the class right now?

522
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,714
I don't think now is a good time.

523
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,382
You're right.

524
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,635
Oh, you should say hi.

525
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,055
Everyone who loves
Onnuri Child Care Center is here.

526
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,723
Hello.

527
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,226
-Hello.
-Hello.

528
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,314
Did you eat?

529
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,107
-No.
-Have some meat.

530
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,735
This is a rare occasion, so eat up. Okay?

531
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,115
Let me. I'm pretty good at grilling meat.

532
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,284
I am as well.
You can be a guest for today.

533
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,418
-Guys, how have you been?
-You should've let him help you.

534
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,171
Did you have to shut him down like that?

535
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,714
Just bring me a plate.

536
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,758
Here you go.

537
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,968
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

538
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,262
All right.

539
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,224
Did you have some? Try it.

540
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,183
Thank you.

541
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,144
-Is it good?
-Is it good?

542
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,521
-Eat up.
-Okay.

543
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,408
Over here!

544
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,159
He looks like a bachelor, right?

545
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,746
But he's too handsome to be single.

546
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,332
Go! Shoot!

547
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,335
Is he here to adopt?

548
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,964
Gosh. He's their English teacher.
Are you stupid?

549
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,303
Bring me some hot water.
This is still too oily.

550
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,435
Is that how you say it?

551
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,358
You're so pathetic.

552
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,320
Dried pollack and beer on our way home?

553
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,448
We haven't gone there in ages.

554
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,283
Exactly.

555
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,034
Dried pollack!

556
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,369
Let's hurry!

557
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,970
Ji-hyeon got adopted.

558
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,805
Yes. I heard.

559
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,224
You must be sad, Hoon.

560
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,851
You liked each other.

561
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,103
We opened a social media account…

562
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,065
that only she and I can see.

563
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,650
I see.

564
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,321
I bet you guys will break up in a year.

565
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,906
You always say that.

566
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,245
Do you want to get adopted too?

567
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,165
Not really.

568
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,292
It's not that bad.

569
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:26,630
You know, I was adopted around your age.

570
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,175
And having a new set of parents

571
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,843
isn't actually that bad.

572
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,432
Do you want me to get adopted?

573
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,646
If I stay here, I get to see you often.

574
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,940
This isn't bad either.

575
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,489
Hoon.

576
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,659
I…

577
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,747
I won't be visiting for about a year.

578
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,208
I need to go somewhere.

579
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:04,709
Will you be back?

580
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,670
What?

581
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,339
Are you coming back after a year?

582
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,010
Of course! I'm definitely coming back.

583
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,597
Then we should also make
a social media account.

584
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,267
But I don't do social media.

585
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,602
You can start now.

586
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,146
Should I? Okay, let's do that.

587
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,733
I'll come again before I leave. Okay?

588
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,444
The English teacher is single.

589
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,909
Thanks for that information.

590
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,085
I'll come by once more before I fly out.

591
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,754
If you're too busy, just give us a call.

592
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,964
It's a long drive.

593
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,175
Okay. Bye, kids. I'll come back.

594
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,303
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

595
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,846
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

596
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,097
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

597
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,765
Drive safe.

598
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,022
Stop looking for him.

599
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,898
-Let's go.
-Okay.

600
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,411
One of the lights
in the boys' room doesn't work.

601
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,663
I replaced the bulb,
but it's still not working.

602
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,956
I'll take a look.

603
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,583
You're good at everything.

604
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,423
Has the assemblyman contacted you yet?

605
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,093
Do you still call him that?

606
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,888
He'll call once his anger subsides.

607
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,725
How's So-won?

608
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,810
She says she's doing well,

609
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,979
but she never sees me
and makes me curious.

610
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,399
That's how younger sisters are.
They can't be bothered.

611
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,317
Is that so?

612
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,818
Ma'am.

613
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,070
What is it, Hoon?

614
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,154
Here.

615
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,367
Goodness, it's a watch. Whose is it?

616
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,993
I found it by the sink.

617
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,120
They must've left it behind.

618
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,170
Hey, you guys left a watch here.

619
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,129
Whose is it?

620
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,423
I knew it was yours.

621
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,926
Parcel delivery?

622
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,262
Hold on.
Are you going back to Seoul today?

623
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,597
I am.

624
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,140
Deliver it for me then, okay?

625
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,103
Just wait. I'll send it over.

626
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,187
Okay.

627
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,731
BIG DRIED POLLACK
TASTY DRAFT BEER!

628
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,113
I guess it's being replaced.

629
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,073
I can't believe the owner.

630
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,867
After all the dried pollack we've had?

631
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,161
How did you not know?
You live around here.

632
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,331
This just shows that
we haven't been drinking much lately.

633
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,218
I have something to say.

634
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,013
I'll be living in Palm Springs for a year.

635
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,936
Where is that?

636
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,020
In the US.

637
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,357
Why?

638
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,277
I'm taking my sabbatical.

639
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,029
I'm going to take a break for a year.

640
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,616
Does that mean

641
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,244
we won't be seeing you for a year?

642
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,290
Aren't you excited
that we'll finally be apart?

643
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,251
Whatever.

644
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,296
At least you won't be
nagging me for a year.

645
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,007
I'm going to video call you every day.
You better pick up.

646
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,718
You should take a break
from nagging as well.

647
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,887
If you're sick of my nagging,

648
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,139
end it with Jin-seok.

649
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,891
How many years has it been?

650
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,935
What's it to you?

651
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,525
Do you know
what I regret the most in life?

652
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,029
Calling him over when you were there.

653
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,157
It was the worst day.

654
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,619
Come on. That's enough, you guys. Drink.

655
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,958
Yes.

656
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,126
That's the place.

657
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,461
Okay.

658
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,298
Are you expecting someone?

659
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,759
Yes. A friend of mine is going to stop by.

660
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,636
He needs to give me something.

661
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,638
It's a guy? Is he single?

662
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,017
He loves clubbing,
so don't get your hopes up.

663
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,019
I know him from my school reunion.

664
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,647
Those Cheongdam-dong snobs?

665
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,651
-Right.
-That makes you a snob too.

666
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,487
You're from the same reunion.

667
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,948
That's why I don't attend anymore.

668
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,325
I convinced my mom.

669
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,164
Over here.

670
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,249
Hey.

671
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,505
You could've bought a new one.
Did you have to call me over here?

672
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,800
I've had this for a while.
You didn't scratch it, did you?

673
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,677
No, I didn't even open it.

674
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,513
Thanks. You can go now.

675
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,897
I thought you were in a hurry.

676
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,985
This place serves delicious pork ribs.

677
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,778
Right?

678
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,823
Sorry? Yes.

679
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,371
There's nothing you can do
if we're destined to meet.

680
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,124
Destined, my foot.

681
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,752
How could you say that
when he's happily married?

682
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,129
When are you flying out?

683
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,256
You should just go tomorrow.

684
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,050
I feel lighthearted overall,

685
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,845
but you and Jin-seok make me feel uneasy.

686
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,513
Are you going to keep this up?

687
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,016
It's an affair.

688
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,893
It's not love.

689
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,061
Hey…

690
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,690
It's none of your business,
so just go to Palm Springs already.

691
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,027
Do you think he'll still date you
when you grow old?

692
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,696
Live your life while you still can.

693
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,573
It's my fucking life!

694
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,749
She's mad.

695
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,254
She's really mad.

696
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,443
Are you mad?

697
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,029
What do you think, you brat?

698
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,325
I'm sorry.

699
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,664
You're just too good for him.

700
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,415
I'm not.

701
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,085
I've never had a shining moment in life.

702
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,630
You were blinding
when you auditioned to become an actress.

703
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,675
And look where that got me.

704
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,097
You know…

705
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,934
I'm so mad at him
because he's the reason why

706
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,310
you couldn't make it.

707
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,604
You could've succeeded
if it wasn't for him.

708
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:23,856
They're all excuses.

709
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:28,987
Mi-jo.

710
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:32,949
I came first.

711
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,911
I met him before she did.

712
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,415
So this isn't an affair.

713
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,709
Are you…

714
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,211
Hey, Chan-young.

715
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,546
I haven't slept with him.

716
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,592
We've never slept together
since he got married.

717
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,803
So stop saying it's an affair.

718
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,724
This is so humiliating.

719
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,309
I didn't want to tell you that.

720
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,729
Hey.

721
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,441
You're driving me crazy. Hey.

722
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,194
Then why haven't you gotten over him yet?

723
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,948
What makes him so great that
you're sacrificing your thirties for him?

724
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,700
I'm mad at myself too.

725
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,787
I hate myself for being this way.

726
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,957
So stop nagging.

727
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,710
I'm going to kill that bastard.

728
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,132
What did he do?
Should he have left that pregnant girl?

729
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,218
So why did you break up?
You should've gone abroad too.

730
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,682
Are you rubbing salt
in the wound? Are you?

731
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,768
Does that make it better?

732
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,354
I don't know, you brat.

733
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,612
I know how you feel.

734
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,073
Just give me some time.

735
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,326
I'm going to quit.

736
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,953
Both smoking and Jin-seok.

737
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,338
So you better not video call me.

738
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,549
I'm going to set up cameras in your house.

739
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,636
You're so obsessive.

740
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,137
Do you like me that much?

741
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,558
Come with me.

742
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,895
Dump him and play golf with me. Okay?

743
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,022
You should quit golf.

744
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,816
Gosh, you're being disgusting.

745
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,026
Hey, I'll pay for everything.

746
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,444
Just pay for the meals.

747
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,529
Forget it.

748
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,743
Who is this?

749
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,261
What is it?

750
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,556
What choice do I have?

751
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,143
He's coming all the way here
to give me my watch.

752
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,813
Will you wait for me at my place then?
I bought some wine.

753
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,648
<i><font color="white">Look at you slurring.</font></i>

754
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,443
<i><font color="white">Get your watch, go home,
and sleep, Dr. Cha.</font></i>

755
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,905
Hey. Let's have just one more drink.

756
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,827
-<i><font color="white">Joo-hee is totally drunk. And I'm sleepy.</font></i>
-What do you say?

757
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,829
<i><font color="white">Get home safe.</font></i>

758
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,499
Okay. Bye.

759
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,726
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

760
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,981
I mean, I thought she was
sending me this by courier.

761
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,692
I didn't know
you'd personally deliver it to me.

762
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,323
Thank you so much.

763
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,041
Here.

764
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,049
They're for you.

765
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,094
-For me?
-Yes.

766
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,638
As a thank-you for bringing my watch.

767
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,266
I just stopped by on my way home.

768
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,394
Do you not like flowers?

769
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:14,230
It's not that.

770
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,693
It's just that I've never received flowers
since graduation.

771
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:20,861
Thank you.

772
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,002
Do you want to eat?

773
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,423
Eat? At this hour?

774
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,017
But…

775
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,437
why is it my fault
that you couldn't eat the meat?

776
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,188
Well…

777
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,482
I enjoy grilling meat.

778
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,110
But you didn't let me,

779
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,611
so I was a bit sulky.

780
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,030
Oh, that?

781
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,532
I was cold, right?

782
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,535
Have some noodles.

783
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:13,247
No. I'll definitely gain weight
if I have carbs this late.

784
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,130
I'm sure soju has calories too.

785
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,924
I made a choice.

786
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,135
Since I can't have both,

787
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,261
I picked soju.

788
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,618
By the way,

789
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,914
you travel quite far to teach English.

790
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,248
Are you doing it pro bono?

791
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,461
It's nothing that grand.

792
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,672
That orphanage is special to me.

793
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,091
I see.

794
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,301
Me too.

795
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,345
You see,

796
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,472
it used to be my home.

797
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,323
Do you know what they're called?

798
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,160
No.

799
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,870
Peonies.

800
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:40,334
They'll be in full bloom by tomorrow.
They have a killer scent.

801
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,881
Your perfume…

802
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:47,967
has a killer scent too.

803
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,014
I only smell soju.

804
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,650
JINGYEOM NOODLES

805
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,319
Hey, let me drive you home.

806
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,738
There are many cabs around here.

807
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:10,656
Goodbye.

808
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,184
By the way…

809
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,146
Can I…

810
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,320
Can I have one of them?

811
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,783
I'm not trying to be selfish.

812
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,161
I just haven't seen peonies in a while.

813
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,122
You can take two, so can I have one?

814
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,460
Sure.

815
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,882
Were these really for me?

816
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:12,468
No.

817
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,306
I'm a terrible liar.

818
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,601
-Do you want one more?
-Gosh, no!

819
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,728
Then I'd look like an awful person.

820
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,149
Thank you for today.

821
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,193
Goodbye.

822
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,112
Let me get you a cab.

823
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,638
What's this place?

824
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,819
Is it a boutique?

825
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,170
Goodness. What's with him?
Why is he coming to me?

826
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:56,822
PEONY

827
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,568
Gosh, my head.

828
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,822
How much did I drink…

829
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:44,953
What?

830
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:56,256
I definitely remember
giving him all three of these last night.

831
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,966
Can I have

832
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,968
one of them?

833
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,805
Sure.

834
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,727
Darn it.

835
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,323
<i><font color="white">The peonies are so fragrant. Thank you.</font></i>

836
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,796
<i><font color="white">I apologize for last night.</font></i>

837
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,715
<i><font color="white">I'm sorry and thank you.</font></i>

838
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,346
<i><font color="white">Any time. Have a good day.</font></i>

839
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,774
WATCH

840
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,299
Come in.

841
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,509
Jin-seok.

842
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:23,969
Hey.

843
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,596
I was nearby.

844
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,306
Really? What were you doing?

845
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,433
Don't ask.

846
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,018
I'm curious. Who were you with?

847
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,478
Don't ask.

848
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,689
Sir, your wife is here.

849
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,860
I thought you'd be here, honey.

850
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,489
Hello.

851
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,491
Hello.

852
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,201
Were you having a meeting?

853
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,954
It's nothing important. I just stopped by.

854
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,960
-I'll get going, Jin-seok.
-Bye.

855
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,262
Did you drive here?

856
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,182
No, a cab. So we could take your car.

857
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,768
Okay. Let me just wrap up quickly.

858
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,648
Next time, call before you come.

859
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,529
Let's go, honey.

860
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,767
A Chinese restaurant?

861
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,394
That's out of the blue.

862
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:40,874
Are you confident during this recession?
You passed up being the chief chef.

863
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,376
I wanted to open my own place.

864
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,586
I guess you're really
not going back to the US.

865
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,755
Gosh. So-won is still here.

866
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,509
It must be uncomfortable
to have such a caring brother.

867
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,052
Do you think so?

868
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:57,224
She says she's living
with a friend but won't let me visit.

869
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,186
Right. Sorry, but I have to run.

870
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,479
I'll make you something.

871
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,481
It's okay. I bought a ticket to a show.

872
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,024
But I feel bad.

873
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,151
I'll visit again once it's open. Bye.

874
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,569
Thanks. I'll call you.

875
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:14,074
RACHMANINOFF

876

2021 KOREAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
JEONG HA-EUN'S RACHMANINOFF

877
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,595
Hey.

878
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,682
I'm in front of the box office. You?

879
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,853
Really?

880
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,773
That's a shame.

881
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,735
Sure. Okay.

882
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,445
Bye.

883
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,513
It was a beautiful performance.

884
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,729
Hey.

885
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,193
We meet again.

886
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,821
What a small world.

887
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,198
I know, right?

888
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:22,786
Are you here alone?

889
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,204
Yes.

890
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,706
Me too.

891
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,172
Did you bring your car?

892
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,258
No, I don't bring it to the theater.

893
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,635
I see. I took a cab too.

894
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,182
You can't have carbs this late, right?

895
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,728
How about some beer?

896
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:50,897
Sure.

897
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,617
Do you like Rachmaninoff?

898
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:06,371
I do. His music is easy on the ear
since it sounds like film music.

899
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,290
You're right.

900
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,923
By the way,
why is the orphanage special to you?

901
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,676
I don't think
you grew up there like I did.

902
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,680
My younger sister grew up there.

903
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,308
I see.

904
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,602
That's unexpected.

905
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,064
You, her adoptive brother,
teach English at her orphanage.

906
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,358
I was curious.

907
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,945
I just suddenly wondered
what kind of place she grew up in.

908
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,574
You two must be close.

909
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,368
What about you?

910
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,455
My older sister treats me very well,
and my parents are great.

911
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,376
We have several things in common.

912
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,213
You're right.

913
01:01:57,005 --> 01:02:00,884
Onnuri Child Care Center,
adoption, and Rachmaninoff.

914
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,596
We have a few things in common,

915
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,265
yet we're still strangers.

916
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,309
How peculiar.

917
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,357
That's a good thing, right?

918
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,281
Now I like peonies too.

919
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:26,785
That means we have
a total of four things in common.

920
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:31,248
I was embarrassed when I sobered up.
I can't believe I took one.

921
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,258
Would you like to come see them?

922
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,766
Are you inviting me over?

923
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,395
I am.

924
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,816
To see the peonies?

925
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,948
We only met twice,

926
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,993
and you're already inviting me over?

927
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,413
This is actually our third

928
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,915
since we met at the orphanage.

929
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,383
You're saying…

930
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,429
that you want to sleep with me, right?

931
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,100
Yes.

932
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:25,922
Do you know what peonies symbolize?

933
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,884
No, I don't.

934
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:30,844
Shyness.

935
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,763
It really doesn't suit

936
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,266
what happened tonight.

937
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,319
Thank you for the drink.

938
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,239
Wait.

939
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:52,991
Let's meet again.

940
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,036
Next time,

941
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,247
how about a movie?

942
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,211
Do you not like me?

943
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:14,220
I'll be leaving Korea soon.

944
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,347
You're leaving?

945
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,726
Yes. To the US.

946
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,313
Does that mean you won't return?

947
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:29,611
I probably will.
I'm taking a break for a year or two.

948
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:31,613
Goodbye then.

949
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,366
When are you leaving?

950
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,871
In a month or two.

951
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,336
Then we should meet a few times

952
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:47,879
before you leave.

953
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,423
Well…

954
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,135
I don't think that's a good idea.

955
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,554
Still.

956
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,850
We should meet
at least once before you go.

957
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,318
Okay.

958
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,154
Goodbye.

959
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,366
-Let me get you a cab.
-No. Don't come out.

960
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,202
-I won't go far--
-No. I feel uncomfortable.

961
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,915
What I mean is,
I feel more comfortable going alone.

962
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,667
Goodbye.

963
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,308
It's such…

964
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,687
an alluring scent.

965
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,494
What is it?

966
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:45,997
Me?

967
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,416
I'm at home.

968
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:51,878
What?

969
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,677
Chan-young.

970
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,430
You're done here. You may leave.

971
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:03,598
Yes, sir.

972
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,810
You should be grateful
that I didn't take this any further.

973
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,230
You should treat your wife better.

974
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,232
-You little--
-Let's just go.

975
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,693
-Let's go.
-That damn woman…

976
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,032
Ms. Jeong.

977
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,785
You may leave as well.

978
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,373
Let's go.

979
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:41,511
I think we've visited
one too many police stations.

980
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,180
I'm used to them now.

981
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:45,848
They feel cozy.

982
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,399
Why did you do it?

983
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,362
They're having an affair.

984
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,950
But why would you care?

985
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:07,787
I don't know.

986
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,747
They made me angry.

987
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,710
Why would you be angry?

988
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:17,380
So what if they're having an affair?
Why would you slap them?

989
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,426
Do Jin-seok and I look like them

990
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,052
in your eyes?

991
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,723
Do we look filthy?

992
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,521
Double standards.

993
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,066
It really hits home, doesn't it?

994
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,486
If I do it, it's love.
If others do, it's an affair.

995
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,364
Chan-young, that's why…

996
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,326
you should…

997
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,661
But you know what, Mi-jo?

998
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,456
It's love for me.

999
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,502
I've always loved him.

1000
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:04,844
But who'll understand you?

1001
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,308
Jin-seok is married, and that's a fact.

1002
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:19,567
You know what?

1003
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,154
I should've just
fully enjoyed my affair with him.

1004
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,867
I should've just left you
back at the station.

1005
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,873
You reek of alcohol.

1006
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,627
I had a drink.

1007
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,337
With whom?

1008
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,506
A guy.

1009
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,092
Hey, I know
you didn't do anything with him.

1010
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:47,470
So why would you
risk your liver like that?

1011
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,182
I finally had my romantic moment,

1012
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,518
but then you called me.

1013
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,603
You're a terrible friend.

1014
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,981
A romantic moment?

1015
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,614
Did you do it?

1016
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,076
Let's go home.

1017
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,994
Hey, I'm calling Joo-hee.

1018
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:13,371
Don't call her.

1019
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,749
Mi-jo. You… Hold on. How long has it been?

1020
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,836
-Don't count, you crazy brat.
-Hold on.

1021
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:22,922
-Joo-hee must be asleep.
-Wait. Where's her number?

1022
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,466
-Come on.
-Joo-hee, were you sleeping?

1023
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:28,386
Hey, Joo-hee.
Chan-young is just a bit crazy right now.

1024
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,013
-Go back to bed.
<i><font color="white">-What? You drank without me?</font></i>

1025
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,224
-No. Go to bed.
-You shouldn't be sleeping!

1026
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,725
<i><font color="white">-What is it?</font></i>
-Sleep tight.

1027
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,936
Goodness. Did you have to wake her up?

1028
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:41,399
Right.

1029
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,276
I'm meeting the new director today.

1030
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,819
How do you know them?

1031
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,362
Through Jin-seok.

1032
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,408
We couldn't find
the right time to meet until now.

1033
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,995
When did you prepare everything? When?

1034
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:58,207
You came up with
a meticulous plan before fleeing abroad.

1035
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,043
Should we find a substitute for you too?

1036
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,045
Would you like to come with me, Ms. Cha?

1037
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,297
And see the clinic go up in flames?

1038
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,430
You better tell Mom and Dad
about this soon.

1039
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,642
I don't know how to.
I should though, right?

1040
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,061
Care to accompany me?

1041
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,356
Why? Too scared to face them by yourself?

1042
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,358
A bit.

1043
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,658
-This place is nice.
-Right?

1044
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,628
<i><font color="white">I'm really sorry,
but I don't think I can make it.</font></i>

1045
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,463
<i><font color="white">Chan-young suddenly called.</font></i>

1046
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,590
<i><font color="white">She didn't sound happy. I'm really sorry.</font></i>

1047
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,560
Chan-young.

1048
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,064
What is it? Is something wrong?

1049
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,233
Can you divorce her when you're 50?

1050
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,403
-Chan-young--
-I can wait until you're 60 too.

1051
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,156
As long as you'll divorce her, I can wait.

1052
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:19,664
Is it a yes or a no?

1053
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,540
Is that what you want?

1054
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:24,752
Yes.

1055
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:32,802
I don't think you can.

1056
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,308
I don't think you'll ever
get a divorce, Jin-seok.

1057
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,442
-Chan-young.
-I quit smoking.

1058
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:51,988
I’m going to quit you too.

1059
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,498
Director Cha Mi-jo?

1060
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,792
Doctor Kim Seon-u?

1061
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,597
<i><font color="white">Some of us had a new beginning</font></i>
