The searing and burning
are both from my power.

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,430
I was able to bear it.

36
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,430
Congratulations on passing
the Angel Level Six Test.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,330
San,

38
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,030
it is now time to teach you
the unique secret skills of our clan.

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,370
Don't even think about going on land!

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,270
This move is called

41
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,270
Hao Tian Nine Extremes.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Such terrifying presence.

43
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,900
Bring it on!

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,700
But Hao Tian Hammer is the bane
of all Storm Attack martial souls.

45
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,170
Due to playing tricks, the Sixth Test
will be harder.

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,800
The one to attack you will be me.

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,420
[Episode 197]

48
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,230
Impossible.

49
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,530
Without Zhu Qing

50
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,400
and the White Tiger of Netherworld
Martial Soul Fusion Skill trump card,

51
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,130
we have no chance of winning.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,300
Once Zhu Qing is done absorbing
the God-given Soul Ring,

53
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,100
she will be the second to reach
the highest soul level after Brother San.

54
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,270
It's a pity she can't help us
with the Sixth Test.

55
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,700
Why don't I ask Bai
to guide me to the ocean?

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,030
I'll find a decade millennium soul beast

57
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,830
and increase my soul power
to the highest level too.

58
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,400
No.

59
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,300
We can't risk your future.

60
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,300
You should know

61
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,230
how important the Eighth
and Ninth Skills are for a soul master.

62
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,630
Also, if we can pass the Sixth Test,

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,630
you will receive a God-given Soul Ring.

64
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,670
That is the best eighth soul ring.

65
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,700
But if we can't pass the Sixth Test
and die here,

66
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,730
what use is that?

67
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,470
No, Brother Dai! You...

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,230
Brother Dai, you... You can't go.

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,530
We are a team.

70
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,770
As the leader of this team

71
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,130
but also the only person
to reach a plateau,

72
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,870
this is what I have to do.

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,800
We trained so hard on Haishen Island
and finally got here today.

74
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,570
What was it all for?

75
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,630
It's all because we want
to return to the Continent

76
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,900
and destroy Martial Soul Empire.

77
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
We will find a way
to make it up to Brother Dai.

78
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,530
Brother Dai is making
such a big sacrifice for us.

79
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,170
We must do our best!

80
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,130
-Yes, do our best!
-Yes, do our best!

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,100
Grandpa, I am ready for the Seventh Test.

82
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,870
Xue, get ready for your Seventh Test.

83
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,100
Your Seventh Test
is to extract Angel's Sword.

84
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,100
God of the Ocean Sixth Test,
we are ready.

85
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,470
I can't watch this battle,

86
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,430
so I'm going now.

87
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,070
You must all make it back alive.

88
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,400
Since we have no way out,
let's forge our path forward.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,770
Conquer our challenges!

90
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,570
- Scale all mountains! 
- Afraid of nothing!

- Never give up!

-will win!

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,130
Are you all ready?

95
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,230
You only have one chance.

96
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,700
We are ready

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,870
and will definitely pass your test.

98
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,370
Okay. Those not involved
may watch from the side.

99
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,730
The test will begin soon.

100
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,430
Be careful now.

101
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,730
The test starts now!

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,800
Go!

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,830
They're fleeing separately as a strategy.

104
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,570
Even though it looks a bit awkward,

105
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,970
it's very effective.

106
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,300
But what a pity...

107
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,430
The second step,
Search Obstruction Waves.

108
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,900
Xiang's Fifth Soul Skill

109
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,770
is Search Obstruction Waves.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,170
It's enough to confuse
the Grand Ocean God Master's

111
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,300
sense of direction
for a limited period of time.

112
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,600
I can finally help everyone!

113
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,570
This is very unexpected.

114
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,600
I thought Tang San picked
the foot of Haishen Mountain

115
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,670
to take advantage of the plants
on the mountain

116
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,300
and use his Blue Silver Domain
to control the field.

117
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,570
Interesting.

118
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,070
Layering Bai Chen Xiang's
Obstruction Waves like this

119
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,170
can indeed impact my spirit power
for a limited time,

120
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,030
so that I can't target all of you.

121
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,970
But

122
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,170
I don't even need to target you.

123
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,070
Grand Ocean God Master!

124
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,400
Didn't you say you wouldn't use
the power of the ocean?

125
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,170
The ocean is calm like a mirror.

126
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,070
She didn't use the power of the ocean,

127
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,100
but instead the moisture in the air.

128
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,700
Rong Rong, Ao!

129
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,430
No matter how far you run,

130
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,200
you are still within my control.

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,200
The Grand Ocean God Master truly is scary.
She hasn't even used her martial soul

132
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,700
and controlled all of us
with her soul power alone.

133
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,270
Even though the Light of the God of the Ocean
can suppress ocean soul masters,

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,570
it's not enough to inhibit
a level 99 Supreme Soul Master.

135
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,130
God Killer Domain!

136
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,830
Even with the Purple Demon Eye
of the Boundless level,

137
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,630
how long can I stop her?

138
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,400
Even though Tang San's spiritual assault
is a bit immature,

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,270
it is already extremely powerful.
With time...

140
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,300
Execute the original plan.

141
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,100
As long as one person lasts longer
than thirty minutes,

142
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,970
we will be successful!

143
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:27,820
[Soul Land]

144
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,730
The fact that his spiritual assault
made Her Highness retreat

145
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,370
shows how much potential Tang San has.

146
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,570
The last person to be able to do so

147
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,230
was the one from the Hao Tian Tribe.

148
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,730
That person should have been
Tang San's great-grandfather.

149
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,670
They used the same Hao Tian Hammer,

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,600
except that Tang San's Hammer
doesn't have additional soul rings yet.

151
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,000
His potential really is limitless.

152
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,470
If he can level up both of his martial souls
to nine rings,

153
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,400
he might actually have the power
to challenge Her Highness.

154
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,430
In his later tests,

155
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,870
do you think he will be able
to defeat Senior Bosaixi?

156
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,030
Be careful now.

157
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,770
How do you know Tang San
can withstand Her Highness's attack?

158
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,500
Besides, we've never seen
the God of the Ocean's Nine Tests.

159
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,590
We cannot predict their future tests.

160
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,170
Don't be so boring.

161
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,930
Don't you want to see

162
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,400
someone more powerful than Senior Bosaixi?

163
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,330
If Brother San
really can reach that level,

164
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,470
we'll have an even bigger chance

165
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,370
of winning against Martial Soul Empire.

166
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,330
She knew that we would hide
in all different corners of Haishen Island.

167
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,900
Why isn't she reacting?

168
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,000
Could it be...?

169
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,200
God Killer Domain, Eight Spider Bone!

170
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,730
She's indeed only attacking me.

171
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,730
It'll be hard for me to escape now.

172
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,800
Unless...

173
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,170
Blue Silver Form,

174
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,230
Majestic Nature, Swallowing Gold Threads!

175
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,230
Tang San, you're very smart

176
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,170
for choosing an advantageous terrain
to stall for time.

177
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,130
Blue Silver Demon Mirror Destruction!

178
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,630
Teleport!

179
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,770
Enough, Tang San.

180
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,400
It's time for this test to end.

181
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,330
Such scary control.

182
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,970
She's using the moisture in the air
to attack rapidly.

183
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,330
There's no way to defend against this!

184

Tang San, oh, Tang San.

185
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,870
If you didn't use Invincible Golden Shield
in time,

186
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,770
you would be a pile of dust by now.

187
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,630
It looked like a light tap,

188
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,530
but it turned out to be so powerful!

189
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,670
Senior Bosaixi's power increased again.

190

The seven of us together

191
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,930

much less Tang San.

He even hid his breathing.

193
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,170
Was he prepared for his escape
in that moment?

194
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,630
Tang San, I hope you have the skills
to pass the test.

195
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,470
Or else, your fate

196
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,400
is death.

no wonder the Martial Soul Hall
never attacked Haishen Island again.

199

If I didn't have Invincible Golden Shield,

200
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,600
she might have destroyed me with one finger.

201
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,370
This is the power of someone
closest to God.

202
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,730
If it comes down to it,

203
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,900
I have to use that move.
