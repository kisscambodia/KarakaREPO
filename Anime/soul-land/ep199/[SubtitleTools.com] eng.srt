Please.

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,490
Master,

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,690
with the command
of General Dai Wei Si, Xing Luo Empire

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,730
captured two of our
important mining towns.

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,600
Go!

59
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,130
Tian Dou Empire also captured
an important lode.

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,430
We lost about 1,500 troops
in this battle.

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,190
Useless!

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,730
Mining is fundamental
to a country's future.

63
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,690
Our empire already lacks mineral resources

64
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,390
and we finally turned things
around recently.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,630
With our current military power,

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,560
even the alliance between Tian Dou
and Xing Luo can't pose a threat.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,760
But this failure might ruin
all of our previous efforts!

68
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,730
Master, please don't be angry.

69
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,130
I will immediately send City Guard
Soul Masters to recapture the land.

70
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,490
I don't want to own something temporarily,
I want their everlasting obedience.

71
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,691
More importantly,
no one can taint the foundation

72
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:30,032
of Martial Soul Empire's development.

73
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,730
Send my orders. Three days from today,

74
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,490
gather all the troops.

75
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,160
Yes.

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,790

77
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,160

Trident Mark
and the God of the Ocean's Trident

79
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,050

80
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,390
It feels like a call.

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,590
Greetings, Senior.

82
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,430
The Head Flamen has waited for long.

83
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,430
The scent here is deep,
sacred, and untainted.

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,690
This is the Haishen Hall.

85
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,630

you will officially begin God's test.

Tang San.

90
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,360
Tang San.

91
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,030
What's wrong?

92
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,660
It seems like even Senior Bo Sai Xi

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,030
didn't sense the God of the Ocean's
spiritual communication with me.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,630
Nothing.

95
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,460
Before the Seventh Test begins,

96
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,360
let me tell you
the God of the Ocean's story.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,090
Do you know how vast the ocean is?

98
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,630
It's about four times bigger
than the Douluo Continent.

99
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,730
That's why there were many more species
living in the ocean than on land.

100
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,130
Long ago, in order to fight
for power over the ocean,

101
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,730
war broke out between
the different ocean tribes.

102
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,530
Numerous tribes were hurt and killed,

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,630
but nobody wanted to stop the war.

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,530
Finally,

105
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,930
an extremely talented, level-99
ocean soul master appeared.

106
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,490
He held a trident and spent his life

107
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,930
traveling to every corner of the ocean.

108
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,860
He ended numerous battles

109
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,190
and saved all the ocean tribes.

110
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,990
And so

111
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,060
he became the God of the Ocean.

112
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Yes.

113
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,490
The trust of tens of thousands
of ocean soul beasts and soul masters

114
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,790
created the Power of Trust,

115
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,630
allowing him to break to level 100
and become the God of the Ocean.

116
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,860
This is also the hardest way
to become a god.

117
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,360
Senior,

118
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,030
besides the Power of Trust,

119
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,660
are there other ways of becoming a god?

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,090
In theory,

121
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,360
as long as a soul master reaches level 100,
they will become a god.

122
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,190
But to reach level 100 from level 99

123
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,530
takes at least a thousand years.

124
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,530
Humans cannot live long enough to do so.

125
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,630
But there is a shortcut.

126
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,190
By heritage.

127
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,460
Receive the approval of an elder god,
and inherit their status.

128
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,590
Does that mean you've already won
the God of the Ocean's approval?

129
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,430
Xue, do you know the legend
of how the Angel became a god?

130
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,230
Not before.

131
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,460
The Angel was also a normal human
before becoming a god.

132
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,760
Back then, people lived under the torture
of sin and disease.

133
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,690
The Angel used a holy sword

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,660
to clear the world's sin and disease.

135
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,130
From then on, the people
were freed from darkness and reborn.

136
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,830
She won the trust of all

137
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,060
and became a god.

138
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,490
But it's a pity that even until now,

139
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,260
the remaining sin of the world

140
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,160
is still secretly accumulating its power,

141
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,630
trying to drag the people
back to darkness again.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,660
The holy sword that the Angel left behind

143
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,090
is her hope for the Angel Tribe
to protect its honor.

144
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,030
Go forth, Xue.

145
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,930
This is your Seventh Test,
pull out the Holy Sword of Angel.

146
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,390
I will definitely pull out
the Holy Sword of Angel

147
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,090
and become the strongest in the world
to defend the Angel Tribe's honor.

148
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,930
That's right.

149
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,730
You, who received
the God of the Ocean's Nine Tests,

150
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,560
are the one chosen
by the God of the Ocean.

151
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,730
Once you've passed
the God of the Ocean's Nine Tests,

152
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,290
you will inherit
the God of the Ocean's position

153
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,460
and become the new God of the Ocean

154
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,390
to rule over all the subjects
of the ocean.

155
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,930
I will definitely extract
the God of the Ocean's Trident

156
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,230
and live up to everyone's expectations.

157

Tang San,

158
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,530
your true test from God is next.

159
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,960
Not only do you need to extract
the God of the Ocean's Trident,

160
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,790
but you also need to win its approval.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,260
Win its approval?

162
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,490
I will.

164
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,960
Is this an illusion?

165

the more likely you are to be burned by the light.

166

Darkness is born from light.

169

170
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,530
Face me with some dignity.

171

Finally, we meet today.

173
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,660
But light swallows the darkness.

174
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,160
The absolute light you pursue

175
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,590
has never existed.

176
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,390
Whether or not it exists is up to me!

177
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,460
Her face looks exactly the same as mine.

178
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,530
Is she my actual examiner
for the Seventh Test?

179
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,590
The game has begun.

180
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,060
I can't fly at night!

181
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,530
