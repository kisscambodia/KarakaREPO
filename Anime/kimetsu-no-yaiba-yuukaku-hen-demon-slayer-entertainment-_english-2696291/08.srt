1
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,220
{\an8}<i>Thank goodness. Nezuko went to sleep.</i>

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,185
<i>-Fast asleep</i>
-Nezuko! Don't!

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>Oh, little bunny from the hill</i>

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,194
<i>Why are your eyes so red?</i>

5
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,465
{\an8}Take a good rest.

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>I can still fight.</i>

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,522
<i>I can still move.</i>

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>This time,</i>

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,153
<i>I'll fight until the end.</i>

10
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,754
Damn. I don't like it, you know.

11
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,341
You have a handsome face, three wives,

12
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,720
and now you're even trying to show off.

13
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,098
You're different.

14
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,768
You're different from the Hashiras
we've killed before.

15
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,149
I believe you've been special
from the moment you were born.

16
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,193
The chosen talented one, I suppose.

17
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,696
I'm so jealous, you know.

18
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,575
I wish you would die as soon as possible.

19
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,493
Talent?

20
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,704
{\an8}What?

21
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,499
Do I look like I've got any talent?

22
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:34,756
If that's what you think of me,
then you had a happy life.

23
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,716
{\an8}What?

24
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,260
It doesn't matter
how many hundreds of years you've lived,

25
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,553
if you are stuck in this place,

26
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,014
then it's no wonder you're so naive.

27
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,558
{\an8}What do you know about us?

28
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,477
I know it clearly.

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,856
I bet you didn't know that
this country is big.

30
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,984
There are a lot of strong people
in this country.

31
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,362
{\an8}<i>There's a guy who is really mysterious.</i>

32
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,322
{\an8}<i>There's a guy who became a Hashira</i>

33
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,157
{\an8}<i>just two months
after learning swordsmanship.</i>

34
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,743
You think I was chosen?

35
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,370
{\an8}That's bullshit!

36
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:10,583
{\an8}Do you know
how many lives I couldn't save?

37
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,709
<i>That's right.</i>

38
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,213
<i>I can never be like Rengoku.</i>

39
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,635
Then how do you explain this?

40
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,347
My blood sickles are poisonous,

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,394
{\an8}but how come you're not dead yet, huh?

42
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,980
I come from a family of ninjas.

43
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,232
I have resistance to poison,
so it won't work.

44
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,944
{\an8}Ninjas have been extinct
since the Edo era.

45
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,570
{\an8}Don't lie to us!

46
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,364
I'm not lying.

47
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,450
<i>Ninjas do exist.</i>

48
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,536
<i>We were nine siblings.</i>

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,372
<i>Seven of them were dead
by the time I was fifteen.</i>

50
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,375
<i>In his panic
with the decline of the family,</i>

51
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,587
<i>my father was obsessed
with the rigorous training he gave us.</i>

52
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>The only ones who survived were me
and my second youngest brother.</i>

53
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>And he was just a reflection of my father.</i>

54
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,182
<i>He had the same thoughts
and actions as my father.</i>

55
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,684
<i>"Subordinates are pawns."</i>

56
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,562
{\an8}<i>"I don't care if my wives die,
as long as they give birth to heirs."</i>

57
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,981
{\an8}<i>He didn't respect other people's will.</i>

58
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,275
<i>He had no human quality.</i>

59
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,697
{\an8}<i>I don't want to be like him.</i>

60
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:31,164
{\an8}The path you chose must be hard, Tengen.

61
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:39,797
It's hard to stay on the battlefield,
denying the values

62
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,677
that were instilled into you
since your youth.

63
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,600
Despite all the contradictions
and conflicts, you…

64
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:56,230
I mean you all
still face forward and fight

65
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,734
to protect human lives.

66
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,409
Thank you. You are a wonderful child.

67
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,581
<i>I would like to thank you too.</i>

68
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,710
<i>Master, of course,</i>

69
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,215
<i>I'll risk my life
and do what I can for you.</i>

70
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,510
<i>Those who carry contradictions
and conflicts are foolish and weak.</i>

71
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,262
<i>I've always been living
in that environment.</i>

72
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,900
What are you laughing at?

73
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:46,322
As I thought, the poison is working,
even if it's slow.

74
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:52,328
You were just bluffing.
That was lame, you know.

75
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,960
No, it's not working at all!

76
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,545
How about I dance for you?

77
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,174
{\an8}I'm on a roll and could eat
a hundred tempura bowls flamboyantly!

78
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,437
{\an8}Don't you dare kick my sister!

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,063
You piece of shit!

80
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,941
{\an8}What?

81
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:32,118
<i>These are special gunpowders that have
the power to injure a demon's body.</i>

82
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,246
<i>The slightest friction from a slash
will cause it to explode.</i>

83
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,791
<i>I didn't even realize
we were getting sliced and blown up.</i>

84
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,753
<i>He's a really quick attacker.</i>

85
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,800
<i>The blade extended?</i>

86
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,512
<i>He's holding onto the blade tip.</i>

87
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,182
<i>What a strong gripping strength.</i>

88
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,691
I missed my chance to kill him.

89
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,321
My head got cut off again!

90
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,492
You piece of shit! I won't forgive you!

91
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,535
{\an8}Sucks…

92
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,412
{\an8}This sucks!

93
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,915
{\an8}Why am I the only one being cut?

94
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,380
{\an8}Don't tell me you've already realized.

95
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,633
{\an8}What do you mean?

96
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,303
There's no point realizing it now,
you know.

97
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:36,474
Because you'll be dying slowly.

98
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:43,272
Even as we speak,
we're winning by the minute.

99
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,275
I wonder about that!

100
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,778
Don't you dare forget about me!

101
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,698
Lord Inosuke and his lackey are here!

102
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,790
Who are you guys?

103
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,383
What?

104
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,150
What's going on?

105
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,739
Don't leave me behind!

106
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:43,207
{\an8}-Those who are injured, come with me!
-Everyone else, please leave!

107
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,303
{\an8}UPPER RANK SIX

108
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,221
{\an8}UPPER RANK SIX

109
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,439
{\an8}You guys are making
a flamboyant entrance, aren't you?

110
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,232
I love it!

111
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,657
{\an8}No matter how many
of your underlings come,

112
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,202
there won't be a happy future for you.

113
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,585
You're all going to die,

114
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,339
so don't look at me
with those bright eyes.

115
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,591
<i>There are two demons now.</i>

116
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,551
<i>What's the meaning of this?</i>

117
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,138
<i>Moreover, the obi demon isn't dead yet.</i>

118
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,266
<i>Are they both Upper Rank Six?</i>

119
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,143
<i>Did they split?</i>

120
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,104
<i>If that's the case,</i>

121
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,316
<i>the main body is definitely this guy.</i>

122
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,735
<i>The smell is different.</i>

123
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,945
<i>It's denser.</i>

124
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,784
<i>It makes my throat feel numb.</i>

125
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>My hands are trembling.</i>

126
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,915
<i>Is it because of fatigue?</i>

127
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,834
<i>Or is it because I'm scared?</i>

128
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,711
<i>No!</i>

129
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,755
<i>But still, I have to…</i>

130
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,091
<i>We have to…</i>

131
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,761
{\an8}We, the Demon Slayer Corps, will win!

132
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,263
No, you can't!

133
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,101
It's a shame
that a reliable Hashira got poisoned!

134
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,353
Poisoned?

135
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,148
We're going to win easily, you dumbasses!

136
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,652
The poison in my body
is nothing more than light shackles!

137
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,445
Don't be cocky!

138
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,281
Shut up and don't look down on humans!

139
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,660
All three of them
are my excellent Tsugukos!

140
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,620
They have the guts not to run away!

141
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,789
Hell, yes.

142
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,375
If you tear my limbs,
then I'll go with biting!

143
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,421
And I've already figured out
how to beat you two!

144
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,009
We just have to cut your heads off
at the same time!

145
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,177
I know I'm right!

146
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,772
Otherwise, there's no reason
to split you guys apart

147
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,692
and take the weak little sister.

148
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,820
You guys are easy!

149
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,948
I see. It's so simple.

150
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,534
We're as good as winners.

151
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,412
The demon hunters died

152
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,540
{\an8}without being able to do
that simple thing.

153
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,417
Even the Hashiras…

154
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,423
I've eaten 15 of them,
and my sister has eaten 7.

155
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,011
That's right. No one lived by sunrise.

156
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:48,559
Because the long night
is always on our side.

157
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,645
Every single one of you should die!

158
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,242
Zenitsu!

159
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,412
Leave that worm-girl to me and Sleepyhead!

160
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,664
You guys beat that mantis-guy!

161
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,916
Get it?

162
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,958
Be careful!

163
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,043
Right!

164
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,214
I won't let you put my sister down.

165
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,344
You're from that time!

166
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,847
I have something to tell you.

167
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,227
{\an8}Apologize to the girl that you hurt,
whose ear you pulled.

168
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311
{\an8}What?

169
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,356
Even though the money you earned was used

170
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,484
{\an8}<i>to provide food, clothing,
and shelter for them,</i>

171
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,196
{\an8}<i>they are not your property.</i>

172
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,407
{\an8}It doesn't mean
you are allowed to do anything.

173
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,578
Don't give me that lame lecture.

174
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:55,209
Do you think that an ugly human like you
can talk to me as an equal?

175
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,420
In this district, women are commodities.

176
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,214
<i>Same as objects.</i>

177
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:06,387
<i>They can be sold, bought, broken,
whatever the owner likes.</i>

178
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,557
<i>Ugly people don't deserve to eat food.</i>

179
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,686
<i>People who can't do anything
won't be treated as human beings.</i>

180
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,609
If you don't like it,
don't do it to others.

181
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,654
{\an8}That's wrong.

182
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:28,409
We're just returning all the suffering
we didn't like that people did to us

183
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,579
and collecting their debt to us.

184
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,373
We can't pay for our past misfortunes

185
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,919
unless we take it
from someone else's fortunes.

186
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:45,676
Because that's how we live, you know.

187
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:51,765
We've killed everyone who made
an accusation against us, you know.

188
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:58,063
And we'll slit your throats
just the same as them!

189
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,109
<i>What an intense bloodlust.</i>

190
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,653
<i>I've got goosebumps
from my elbows to my neck.</i>

191
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,324
<i>No wonder,
we're dealing with Upper Rank Six.</i>

192
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,950
<i>I must stay strong.</i>

193
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,746
<i>Uzui has been poisoned.
I have to protect him.</i>

194
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,207
<i>Swing the sword as soon as he moves!</i>

195
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,711
<i>Even a little bit, the moment he moves…</i>

196
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,714
<i>Swing the sword!</i>

197
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,632
<i>Dodge!</i>

198
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,591
<i>Dodge his attack!</i>

199
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,676
{\an8}<i>Lean back! Quick!</i>

200
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,062
<i>What was I doing?</i>

201
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,273
{\an8}<i>I ended up dragging him
because he was protecting me.</i>

202
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,077
{\an8}<i>A myriad of obi are attacking from above.</i>

203
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,170
What? She has three eyes?

204
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,675
{\an8}I can see all your movements!

205
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:13,013
Since my brother is awake now,
this is my true power.

206
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,767
Shut up! Don't talk with a squeaky voice!

207
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,022
{\an8}You were lying that
they are your Tsugukos, weren't you?

208
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,151
Your movements are out of control.

209
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,904
Not even close.

210
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,203
You can't even get close to me!

211
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,371
So annoying!

212
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,874
Worm-Girl, stop blabbering!

213
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,377
If you don't like it,
go ahead and kill us!

214
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,506
As you wish!

215
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,735
{\an8}Die!

216
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,072
<i>So fast. He really is like a mantis.</i>

217
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,949
<i>What's with his style?</i>

218
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,801
{\an8}<i>There's no way out.</i>

219
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,847
{\an8}<i>So heavy!</i>

220
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,515
<i>His attacks are heavy!</i>

221
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,395
<i>Parry it! Deflect it away!</i>

222
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>If I take it head-on, my sword will break!</i>

223
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:51,153
<i>In terms of strength,
the weaker one will always lose.</i>

224
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,282
<i>I have to carefully observe the flow
of its power and deflect it away.</i>

225
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,786
<i>In terms of defense,
Water Breathing's flexibility is superior.</i>

226
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,788
<i>If only I could deflect it,</i>

227
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,458
<i>my sword wouldn't be chipped.</i>

228
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,636
{\an8}<i>Sound Breathing, Fifth Form:</i>

229
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,140
{\an8}<i>String Performance!</i>

230
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:26,313
{\an8}<i>It's useless pushing me
with noisy techniques, you know.</i>

231
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,360
{\an8}Die, you ugly pieces of shit!

232
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,865
In addition to the obi,
there are blood blades coming at us now!

233
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,369
What the hell?
We can't get close to Worm-Girl at all!

234
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,537
Damn it!

235
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,539
The bloody blades are especially bad news!

236
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,876
Knowing its graze can kill you
makes me tingle!

237
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,885
<i>Be useful!</i>

238
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,929
<i>Reduce their attacks, even a little!</i>

239
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,598
<i>And find a way to win!</i>

240
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,851
<i>He's already in bad shape.</i>

241
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,186
<i>It makes me wonder how he can still move.</i>

242
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,314
<i>The wound on his shoulder
is probably quite deep.</i>

243
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,984
<i>He barely managed to stop the bleeding.</i>

244
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,988
<i>I bet he couldn't hold his sword
unless his left hand was tied to the hilt.</i>

245
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,158
<i>It's because I got poisoned.</i>

246
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,661
<i>If I don't end this soon,
we'll be wiped out.</i>

247
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,541
<i>It hurts.</i>

248
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,169
<i>I can't maintain my breathing
in this onslaught.</i>

249
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,129
<i>I'm going to lose consciousness.</i>

250
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,382
<i>I have to do recovery breathing somehow.</i>

251
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,780
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

252
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,616
<i>Are those</i> kunai?

253
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:05,537
<i>It will be hard to deal with all of those
while fighting the Hashira.</i>

254
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,498
<i>It's irritating.</i>

255
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,668
<i>Not to mention, there are
three immature demon hunters.</i>

256
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,172
<i>Well, I can just let those hit me.</i>

257
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:20,302
{\an8}<i>Wait. Why do such a pointless attack now?</i>

258
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,140
Blood Demon Art: Rampant Arc Rampage.

259
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,476
<i>He created a canopy with his slashes?</i>

260
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,978
<i>Hey.</i>

261
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,482
<i>What's wrong with this guy?
He's coming right at me.</i>

262
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,986
<i>You got hit by those</i> kunai, <i>you know.</i>

263
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,657
<i>Oh, right, he's a ninja, not a swordsman.</i>

264
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,826
<i>He's not in his senses from the start.</i>

265
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,501
<i>My legs aren't regenerating?</i>

266
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>I knew it. They were laced with something.</i>

267
00:20:55,337 --> 00:21:01,009
{\an8}<i>These</i> kunai <i>probably have something
extracted from wisteria flowers.</i>

268
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,512
<i>My body is paralyzed.</i>

269
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,433
<i>Splendid.</i>

270
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,436
<i>You've begun to turn the tides
in a short time.</i>

271
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,605
<i>It's very fun, you know!</i>

272
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,107
<i>Please, get hit!</i>

273
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,206
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

274
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,043
Rengoku, how would you fight?

275
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,547
I may never be like you.

276
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,926
And I don't think I can ever be like you.

277
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,054
Rengoku?

278
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,056
Your swordsmanship is magnificent.

279
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,558
You have too many wives, though.

280
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:22,192
I leave Young Kamado, Yellow Boy,
and Young Boar Head to you, Uzui.

281
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,697
Just leave them to me flamboyantly.

282
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,159
{\an8}Next, episode 9, "Once We've Defeated
the Upper Rank Demons."
