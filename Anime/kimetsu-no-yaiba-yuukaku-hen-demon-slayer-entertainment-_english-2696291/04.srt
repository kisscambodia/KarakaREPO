{\an8}TOKITO HOUSE

2
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,837
{\an8}<i>Oiran!</i>

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,339
Let's play!

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,008
Okay, then.

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,843
-Oiran!
-Yes?

6
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,595
Please read me a book.

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,682
{\an8}Sure. Which one?

8
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,643
{\an8}Well…

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,769
{\an8}Me too!

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,938
{\an8}Read it for me too.

11
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:26,860
{\an8}Let's read hers first, and then yours.

12
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,237
{\an8}I can wait until later.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,864
{\an8}Me too!

14
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,366
Why do you always copy me?

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,909
But…

16
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,369
Oh, my.

17
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,372
I just remembered something.

18
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,042
First, I have something for you two.

19
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,919
What is it?

20
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,130
What are you going to give us, Oiran?

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,644
But aren't these important to you?

22
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,689
It's okay. Don't think about it.

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,860
I want to give you these
because I love you both.

24
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,741
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

25
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,328
Oiran! Put it on my hair!

26
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,330
Come on!

27
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,291
All right, one person at a time.

28
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,391
She has disappeared?

29
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,392
Yes.

30
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,730
Well, it's Zenko.
The girl with yellow hair.

31
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,566
She was unconscious, so we let her rest,

32
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,735
but now she's not in her room.

33
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,445
Should we look for her?

34
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,490
No, that's enough. Don't look for her.

35
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,993
She deserted. It's not my problem.

36
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,370
{\an8}She probably ran off somewhere.

37
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,997
Leave her be.

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,999
But, Master…

39
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,169
Silence!

40
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,922
Begone!

41
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,800
Don't speak about Zenko again.

42
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,222
Let everyone know about that.

43
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,810
{\an8}It's all because she made
Warabihime Oiran upset.

44
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,314
Both Zenko and Omitsu.

45
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,110
I told you already!

46
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,738
There's a demon at my place!

47
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,865
Well…

48
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,117
It looked like this!

49
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,036
Like this!

50
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:10,041
Yes, well, give me some time to think.

51
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,376
How about this?

52
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,544
Can you tell if I do this?

53
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,966
Uzui and Zenitsu should've been here
already for our regular meeting.

54
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,427
It was like this! I know it!

55
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,221
Yes, I understand.

56
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,056
Zenitsu is not coming.

57
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,062
<i>This guy is something else.</i>

58
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,855
<i>He didn't make any sound.</i>

59
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,525
<i>I didn't feel the air wafting.</i>

60
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,571
Zenitsu isn't coming?
What do you mean by that?

61
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,909
{\an8}I'm sorry for putting you in danger.

62
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:52,959
I made a lot of bad decisions
because I wanted to rescue my wives.

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,337
I don't know where Zenitsu is right now.

64
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,756
I lost contact with him last night.

65
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,926
You need to leave this district.

66
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,678
You're not qualified enough.

67
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,598
{\an8}If there are Upper Rank demons here,
you can't fight them.

68
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,104
I'll consider those
who have disappeared dead.

69
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,028
I'll take on the rest myself.

70
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,113
No, Uzui. We will--

71
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,281
Don't be ashamed.

72
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,242
{\an8}Whoever lives wins.

73
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,911
{\an8}Don't misjudge an opportunity.

74
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,457
Hold it, old man!

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,923
I guess he doesn't trust us
because we are at the bottom rank.

76
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:46,262
We're Kanoe now. We've been promoted.

77
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,180
What?

78
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,182
Do you even remember how ranks work?

79
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,727
{\an8}<i>We were Mizunoto, the bottom rank.</i>

80
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,730
{\an8}<i>Now we're Kanoe, fourth from the bottom.</i>

81
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,441
{\an8}What? They've caught up to me!

82
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,446
{\an8}Suck on that, bed-wetter!
I'll make you eat my dust!

83
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,740
{\an8}What did you say, stupid boar?

84
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,533
{\an8}Want to fight, punk?

85
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,870
{\an8}CURRENT RANK: KANOE

86
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,206
{\an8}Watch carefully.

87
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,666
Show me my rank.

88
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,713
{\an8}KANOE

89
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,215
{\an8}How's that?

90
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:26,052
<i>What was that?</i>

91
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,474
Didn't your hand feel funny
in the Wisteria Mountain?

92
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,686
{\an8}It was itchy,
but I was tired so I'm not sure.

93
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,897
{\an8}It's called "Wisteria Carving."

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,942
{\an8}It appears with
the swelling of words and muscle tissues.

95
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,529
{\an8}How did I miss this?

96
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,614
{\an8}It's proof that you're
from the Demon Slayer Corps.

97
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,701
{\an8}Cheer up!

98
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,830
Right! Now is not the time. I'm sorry!

99
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,375
I'll go to the Ogimoto House at nighttime.

100
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,460
<i>Wait for me until then.</i>

101
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,546
<i>Don't act alone!</i>

102
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,172
Why?

103
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,217
I'll be done investigating
my brothel today!

104
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,930
{\an8}I found a demon at my place,
so come over right now!

105
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,433
How can you be so stupid?

106
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,643
They're too loud.

107
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,439
-That's not what I mean!
-What?

108
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,444
Doesn't Uzui always watch the place
from the outside during the night?

109
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,528
That hurts!

110
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:31,451
But Zenitsu is gone
and the demon at your brothel is hiding.

111
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,955
Hey! Stop hitting me already!

112
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,959
{\an8}There might be a secret passage
inside the building.

113
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,336
Secret passage?

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
That's right.

115
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,466
If they don't go outside of the brothels,

116
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,595
it means they're most likely
disguising themselves as workers.

117
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,222
Since they're working at the brothels,

118
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,225
<i>they become better
at pretending to be humans</i>

119
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,644
and become more cautious
when killing people.

120
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,730
To avoid anyone noticing.

121
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,982
I see.

122
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,110
It takes some effort
to clean up after a murder.

123
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,821
Blood is not easy to remove.

124
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
This district is most active at night.

125
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,703
This greatly benefits them,
but also puts them at a disadvantage.

126
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,414
They have to work at night.

127
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,541
If not, others may become suspicious.

128
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,752
That makes sense.

129
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:28,174
I think Zenitsu and Uzui's wives
are still alive.

130
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,386
So what I intend to do now is save them.

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,723
I want you to do the same, Inosuke.

132
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,892
And please…

133
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,394
stay alive.

134
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,147
Are you okay with that?

135
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,987
Everything you said just now…

136
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,991
{\an8}is exactly what I was trying to say.

137
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,332
Oiran, here's some tea.

138
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,750
Thank you.

139
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,587
I'm almost ready.
Go ahead and eat your meal.

140
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,339
All right!

141
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,468
We're eating dinner first!

142
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,011
We'll eat first!

143
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,181
What?

144
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,684
I love you, Koinatsu Oiran.

145
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,644
I love you too!

146
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,607
I love both of you too.

147
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,068
I understand, so go on.

148
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,903
-All right!
-All right!

149
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,948
She looks so happy.

150
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,449
Yes!

151
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,331
Such sweet kids.

152
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,587
Miss Koinatsu.

153
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,133
Sumi?

154
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,844
I apologize for the intrusion.

155
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,972
I'm leaving Tokito House.

156
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,433
Can you give this money to the master?

157
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,977
It's as thanks for taking care of me.

158
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,985
Sumi, your outfit…

159
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,157
I dressed as a girl for a reason,
but I'm actually a man.

160
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,576
Oh, I already know about that.

161
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,746
It's obvious just from looking at you
and listening to you.

162
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,248
What?

163
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,170
I realized that you are a man
from the beginning.

164
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,215
I was wondering
what business you have in this place.

165
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,804
<i>I never thought anyone would find out.</i>

166
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,224
You have your circumstances, right?

167
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,936
It's true that you're worried
about Suma, right?

168
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,690
Yes! That part is true! I wasn't lying!

169
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,070
I will save those who have disappeared.

170
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,364
Thank you.

171
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,532
I'm relieved to hear that.

172
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,080
I'll be leaving this district by tomorrow.

173
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,084
Really? That's great to hear!

174
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,879
There's someone who wants to take
someone like me as his wife.

175
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,632
I'm really happy right now.

176
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,218
However…

177
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,932
I couldn't help but worry
about everyone I'm leaving behind.

178
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,935
Many unsettling incidents have happened,

179
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,730
but I don't even have the means
to investigate them.

180
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,525
That's not your fault.

181
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,487
Please don't let it bother you
and just keep smiling.

182
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:42,660
I don't want you to leave either, Sumi.

183
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,839
I'm going, then.

184
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,385
May you find happiness.

185
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,971
Thank you.

186
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,268
Same to you, Sumi.
Please take care of Suma.

187
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,477
Yes!

188
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,538
Did you forget something?

189
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:34,962
Yes, I have to eat you now
so I won't forget.

190
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,467
This will be
your last night here after all.

191
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,052
Am I right, Koinatsu?

192
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,221
UPPER RANK SIX

193
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,273
<i>This is bad. It's almost dark.</i>

194
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,568
{\an8}<i>I must hurry and meet up with Inosuke.</i>

195
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,325
<i>I smell something.</i>

196
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,911
<i>It's faint, but sweet.</i>

197
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,079
<i>It's a demon.</i>

198
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,874
<i>I smell a demon nearby.</i>

199
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,751
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

200
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,879
He's late.

201
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,673
It's getting late and he's still not here.

202
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,384
That stupid Soichiro!

203
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,720
I'll be making my move!

204
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,390
By upholding pig assault in my heart!

205
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,271
Mice, bring me my swords!

206
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,279
That guy is really something else.

207
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,621
I can't believe he has buff mice
as servants.

208
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,624
I want my own ninja beasts!

209
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,886
I'm off to kill demons!

210
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,515
Pig assault!

211
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,734
What happened to Zenko and Hinatsuru?

212
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,821
Give me a brief answer.

213
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,283
Don't question me back.

214
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,163
Zenko has disappeared.

215
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,711
Hinatsuru got sick
and was sent to a low-class brothel.

216
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,339
Tell me everything you can think of.

217
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,758
Who do you think is suspicious?

218
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,762
Talk. You can trust me.

219
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,395
{\an8}Whoever it is, I'm going to kill it.

220
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,648
I'll avenge your losses.

221
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,693
<i>Omitsu…</i>

222
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,657
{\an8}An Oiran named Warabihime.

223
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,078
{\an8}She's in a room to the north
where sunlight can't reach.

224
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,095
<i>It's empty.</i>

225
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,431
<i>She must be on the hunt.</i>

226
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,064
<i>Let's visit Hinatsuru's place
while I look for the demon along the way.</i>

227
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>She should know something
if she's still alive.</i>

228
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,114
<i>Either way, the demon
should return here at dawn.</i>

229
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,619
{\an8}<i>I'll end this with my own hands.</i>

230
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,096
<i>The smell is getting stronger.</i>

231
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,806
<i>There's no doubt.</i>

232
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,599
Miss Koinatsu!

233
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,230
Are you the demon hunter boy?

234
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,857
You're finally here.

235
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,360
How many of you are there?

236
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:30,614
One of you must be the ugly kid
with yellow hair.

237
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,784
Are the Hashiras coming?

238
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,744
Are they coming soon?

239
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,665
I don't think you're a Hashira.

240
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,625
You look so weak.

241
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,129
I don't need anyone besides Hashiras.

242
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,338
Do you understand?

243
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,509
<i>What's happening to her body?</i>

244
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,137
<i>Miss Koinatsu's body is gone.</i>

245
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,141
<i>She's not bleeding,
and I don't smell blood.</i>

246
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,689
{\an8}I'm not going to eat something
so hideous and filthy.

247
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,024
UPPER RANK SIX

248
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,737
<i>She's Upper Rank Six!</i>

249
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,905
Let go of her!

250
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,911
Who do you think you're talking to?

251
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,261
<i>She's fast.</i>

252
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,388
<i>I couldn't see her attack.</i>

253
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,474
<i>Upper Rank…</i>

254
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,019
<i>My limbs are shivering.</i>

255
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,480
<i>My body feels numb.</i>

256
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,899
<i>Calm down!</i>

257
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,611
<i>My body was able to react.</i>

258
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,199
<i>If it wasn't, I would've died already.</i>

259
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,162
<i>The reason I'm shivering right now</i>

260
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,331
<i>is because I'm scared.</i>

261
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:09,171
<i>My body feels numb
because I took a powerful blow to my back.</i>

262
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,674
<i>That demon uses her obi as weapon.</i>

263
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,884
<i>She has supernatural powers.</i>

264
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,720
<i>She can trap humans within her obi.</i>

265
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,599
<i>That's why even though
we scoured the building,</i>

266
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,936
<i>we couldn't find any secret passageway.</i>

267
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,108
<i>As long as her obi can get through,
she can kidnap anyone.</i>

268
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,944
You're still alive.

269
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,862
Gosh.

270
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,281
You're stronger than I thought.

271
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,244
You have some pretty eyes.

272
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,083
I'll pluck out your eyeballs and eat them.

273
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,006
<i>The box!</i>

274
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,259
<i>It's not broken.</i>

275
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,637
<i>But if it takes another blow,
it will break.</i>

276
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm sorry, Nezuko.

277
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,018
The shoulder strap is broken.

278
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,770
I can't keep it on my back.

279
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,234
{\an8}Don't get out of the box.

280
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,862
{\an8}Not unless you feel you're in danger.

281
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,413
Water Breathing, Fourth Form:

282
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,375
Striking Tide, Turbulent!

283
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:10,792
<i>He was able to maneuver while in the air.</i>

284
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,169
<i>Furthermore,</i>

285
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:17,883
<i>he cut the part
where I trapped Koinatsu cleanly.</i>

286
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,267
You're kind of cute,
even though you're ugly.

287
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:36,068
I think I'm starting to like you.

288
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,071
You're like a rat on the verge of dying.

289
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,244
{\an8}<i>Upper Rank Six.</i>

290
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:51,166
{\an8}<i>Can I fight her
without Uzui, Zenitsu, and Inosuke?</i>

291
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,544
<i>Can I fight an Upper Rank alone?</i>

292
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,341
<i>No, that's not important right now.</i>

293
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,555
<i>I have no choice but to fight!</i>

294
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,204
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

295
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,872
Good job, you guys.

296
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,958
What are they exactly?

297
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,961
{\an8}They are ninja beasts, the Buff Mice!

298
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,672
<i>They can go to places where we can't.</i>

299
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,592
<i>They stay hidden
while they help us hunt demons.</i>

300
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,221
<i>You can call them
the "Shadow Demon Slayer Corps."</i>

301
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,932
Here's some Taisho-era secret.

302
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:16,144
I only gather and train gutsy mice
to become part of the Buff Mice,

303
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,023
but they also have to be narcissists
who can admire their own muscles.

304
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,401
In other words,
those who like to look flamboyant.

305
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,363
Next, episode 5,
"Let's Make it Flamboyant."

306
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,281
TO BE CONTINUED

307
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,242
They're really something else.
