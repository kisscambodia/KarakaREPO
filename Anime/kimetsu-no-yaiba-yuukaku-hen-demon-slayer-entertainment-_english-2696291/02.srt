1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,962
The Entertainment District?

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:08,675
You know, that place. It's where people…

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,969
You really don't know?

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,265
Listen up!

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,894
I am a god!

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,064
While all of you are goddamned trash!

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,445
The first thing you need to do
is to keep that in mind!

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,654
Drill it into your brains!

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>You'll become dogs when I order you to!</i>

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,618
<i>You'll become monkeys when I order you to!</i>

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,121
<i>Humor me as you hunch over</i>

12
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,081
<i>-and rub your hands!</i>
-You're exactly right.

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>-Never stop singing my praises!</i>
-You're the greatest, milord.

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,960
Right.

15
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,171
{\an8}<i>Let me say it one more time.</i>

16
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,381
{\an8}<i>I am a god!</i>

17
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>This guy is a complete weirdo.</i>

18
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,893
What exactly is your domain as a god?

19
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,687
<i>Why are you falling for his lies?</i>

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,981
-Good question.
<i>-What?</i>

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,816
You're a sharp kid.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,028
<i>That was a dumb question.
Which part of it was sharp?</i>

23
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,991
{\an8}I am a god who rules over flamboyance,
the God of Festivals.

24
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,701
<i>He's an idiot.</i>

25
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,829
<i>He must be ruling over idiots.</i>

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,624
I'm the King of the Mountains.

27
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,585
Nice to meet you, God of Festivals.

28
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,174
What are you on about?

29
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,885
You're weirding me out.

30
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,807
{\an8}<i>Hold up! You were acting just like him!</i>

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,642
{\an8}<i>You're just as cringey!</i>

32
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,229
-What? What did you say?
-Inosuke, don't!

33
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,105
-You're creepy.
-Let me go, Gonpachiro!

34
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,568
<i>I suppose even he can't stand people
who are as delusional as himself.</i>

35
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,239
We don't have all day.

36
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,365
Let's get going.

37
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,534
Keep up with me.

38
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,249
What?

39
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,291
He's gone!

40
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,088
He's too fast!
He's already way over there!

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,423
I can barely see him!

42
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,552
So that's the power
of the God of Festivals?

43
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,347
No, he's the Hashira Tengen Uzui.

44
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,267
We've got to hurry up after him!

45
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,102
Be careful!

46
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,854
-Be careful!
-Be careful!

47
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,107
{\an8}-Safe journeys!
-Safe journeys!

48
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,225
Listen up, kids.

49
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,602
Keep a low profile.

50
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,896
We're only here to observe.

51
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,941
Never get off of the rickshaw.

52
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,403
Where are you going, Zenitsu?

53
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,363
Inosuke!

54
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,574
Come back!

55
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,411
Those damned kids!

56
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,124
Calm down, Inosuke.

57
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,750
Where are you rascals going?

58
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,421
Hey, Yellow Head! Stop right there!

59
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,800
This place…

60
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,593
It doesn't feel like nighttime at all.

61
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,972
<i>This is the Yoshiwara
Entertainment District.</i>

62
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,474
<i>A night district where the allure
and desire of men and women</i>

63
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,852
<i>creates a storm of love and hatred.</i>

64
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,937
<i>Isn't it flamboyant?</i>

65
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,981
What the hell is this place?

66
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,693
There are people everywhere!

67
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,532
Pig assault!

68
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,745
-Calm down, idiot!
-The Lion Dance is out of control!

69
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,831
Hey! Where did Yellow Head go?

70
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,749
What?

71
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,628
Hello there, Yellow Boy.

72
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,381
Want to come by?

73
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,633
We have sweets.

74
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,226
Come on inside.

75
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:58,191
<i>There are so many beautiful ladies!</i>

76
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,026
{\an8}Shut it!

77
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,403
It's still too early for you.

78
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,991
<i>Take a good look.</i>

79
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:12,955
{\an8}<i>This place sleeps during the day
but shines so brilliantly at night.</i>

80
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,541
It's the perfect place
for demons, isn't it?

81
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,669
The courtesans here are usually women

82
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,215
who were sold because of poverty or debt.

83
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,843
<i>In return, they're given food,
clothing, and shelter.</i>

84
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,180
<i>As their career advances,
someone rich may buy them off.</i>

85
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:33,518
<i>There are different ranks of courtesans,
but the top, the Oiran, are distinct.</i>

86
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:38,231
<i>Not just beautiful,
they also need to be smart and talented.</i>

87
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:44,070
<i>They're special women on whom brothels
spend their money and time to nurture.</i>

88
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,697
<i>That's interesting.</i>

89
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,534
<i>Enough sightseeing, then.</i>

90
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,743
<i>Let's go.</i>

91
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,789
WISTERIA

92
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,042
Good evening.

93
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,964
Listen up.

94
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,966
After you've infiltrated the brothels,

95
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,051
I need you to find my wives first.

96
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,054
I'll find information on the demons
in the meantime.

97
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,309
Unacceptable!

98
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,394
What?

99
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,396
This is no joking matter!

100
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,316
How dare you use your men
to find wives for you?

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,902
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,281
-No! Let me tell you straight up!
-Zenitsu!

103
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,034
{\an8}No one would like someone
as bizarre and eccentric as you!

104
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,286
{\an8}But still!

105
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,206
{\an8}You're telling us demon hunters
to find wives for you?

106
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,958
{\an8}Are you an idiot?

107
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,127
{\an8}My wives have infiltrated the district

108
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,713
{\an8}and are gathering information
about the demons!

109
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,717
We've lost contact since then,
so I'm going to try and find them too!

110
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,055
It's all just in your head, right?

111
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,515
You little punk!

112
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,772
These are the messages
that they sent through crows.

113
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,692
There's quite a lot of them.

114
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,653
They must have been here
for quite some time already.

115
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,947
Actually, I have three wives.

116
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,784
Three wives?

117
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,662
{\an8}Three?

118
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,833
{\an8}You bastard! How can you have three wives?

119
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,251
{\an8}Do you think you can fool me?

120
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,257
Do you have a problem with that?

121
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,139
They keep reminding you
through these messages to try your best

122
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,475
not to stand out when you arrive.

123
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,602
That's what I've told you kids.

124
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,188
What exactly are we supposed to do?

125
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,024
We're going to get in disguise.

126
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,777
I hate to do this,
but we have to look plain.

127
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,740
{\an8}<i>My three wives are talented female ninjas,
also known as</i> "kunoichi."

128
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:57,245
{\an8}<i>I used to think that the district
was the perfect hideout for demons,</i>

129
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,707
{\an8}<i>but when I went in as a patron,
I couldn't find their traces at all.</i>

130
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,003
{\an8}<i>That's why I asked them
to dig in even deeper.</i>

131
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,840
We've narrowed it down
to three suspicious brothels.

132
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,220
You will go there,
look for my wives, and gather intel.

133
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,138
<i>There's Suma at Tokito House,</i>

134
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,015
<i>Makio at Ogimoto House,</i>

135
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,226
<i>and Hinatsuru at Kyogoku House.</i>

136
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,229
I bet your wives are dead by now.

137
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,817
Please excuse me.

138
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,820
I've brought the items you asked for.

139
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,364
Thank you.

140
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,450
{\an8}WISTERIA

141
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,082
Oh, dear. I mean…

142
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,460
{\an8}These are some ugly girls.

143
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,461
{\an8}ZENKO, SUMIKO, INOKO

144
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,387
Well, I don't think you can work here.

145
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,307
Can you please do something?

146
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,061
I think their talents would show
if you nurtured them, mistress.

147
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,105
We're sorry, but…

148
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:12,320
Well, we might have space for another one.

149
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,698
Then I'm leaving one of them
in your hands.

150
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,075
Much appreciated, mistress.

151
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,412
I'll take the one in the middle.

152
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,331
She seems to be a good girl.

153
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,083
I will do my best!

154
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,336
SUMIKO GOT HIRED

155
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,963
You kids are worthless.

156
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,841
Can't you sell for any higher?

157
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,598
Don't think I'm ever going to talk to you.

158
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,517
Are you mad
because I'm forcing you to cross-dress?

159
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,395
I've told you
that you have to follow my orders!

160
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,525
<i>It's not about the cross-dressing,
you idiot.</i>

161
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,903
<i>It's your face.</i>

162
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,530
<i>How could you be so good-looking?</i>

163
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,240
<i>Give me a break!</i>

164
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,495
Hey, there's a whole bunch
of people over there.

165
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,649
Oh, that's an Oiran Parade.

166
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,235
She's Koinatsu Oiran from Tokito House.

167
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,114
The top-ranking courtesan
is going to greet her patron.

168
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,449
The whole thing is very flamboyant.

169
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,536
{\an8}Wife! Is she one of your wives?

170
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,579
{\an8}Is that pretty woman your wife?

171
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,705
{\an8}This is too much!

172
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,333
{\an8}Are all of your three wives
that beautiful?

173
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,543
{\an8}She's not my wife!

174
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,170
She walks like a snail.

175
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,757
She would be dead meat
if she lived in the mountains.

176
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,135
What the…

177
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,138
{\an8}<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

178
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,933
I would like to take this girl in.

179
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,017
Can I?

180
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,520
I know you. Aren't you…

181
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:13,149
Right. I work at Ogimoto House.

182
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:18,070
I would be more than happy
if Ogimoto House wants to have my girl.

183
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,240
But would you be willing
to tell me the reason?

184
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,578
I can always depend on my eyes.

185
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,164
I wish you a good life, Inoko.

186
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,584
INOKO GOT HIRED

187
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,550
<i>Oh, no! I'm the only one left.</i>

188
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,386
{\an8}UNWANTED

189
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,388
<i>Look at this!</i>

190
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,140
Amazing!

191
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:50,352
Her makeup was so weird,
but look at her without them!

192
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,896
What a catch!

193
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,690
We got such a looker for so cheap!

194
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:55,608
<i>What?</i>

195
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,403
I'm going to train you hard!

196
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:05,159
You're going to be more famous than
Kyogoku's Warabihime or Tokito's Koinatsu!

197
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,245
But her body is so stiff for some reason.

198
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,749
The plumper and thicker she is,
the better!

199
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,211
She's stiffer than plump, though.

200
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:23,761
{\an8}KYOGOKU HOUSE

201
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,581
She's really good at playing <i>shamisen</i>.

202
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,042
You're right. It's so impactful.

203
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,710
Is she the new girl?

204
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,171
Apparently, she has good ears.

205
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,217
She can play a piece using <i>shamisen</i>
or <i>koto</i> after just hearing it once.

206
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,846
But she's so ugly.

207
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,307
How did she get accepted here?

208
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:15,396
I heard the guy who sold her
to our brothel was pretty hot.

209
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,647
Oh, my.

210
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,483
Really? I wish I could've met him.

211
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,112
<i>Even the madam was stunned.</i>

212
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,910
I understand her feelings.
That girl will be going places.

213
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:35,833
She's determined to get back
at the man who abandoned her.

214
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,168
Girls like her are strong.

215
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,547
I see.

216
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,675
{\an8}You can make her clean
the toilets or whatever.

217
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,427
{\an8}Please take her in.

218
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,263
{\an8}I'll even give her for free.

219
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,102
<i>I swear I'll get back at that man!</i>

220
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:59,356
<i>I'm going to be the best Oiran
in Yoshiwara!</i>

221
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,152
TOKITO HOUSE

222
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,115
Hey, Sumiko.

223
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,410
Yes?

224
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,288
We don't have enough people.

225
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,206
Can you help carry these upstairs?

226
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,168
I understand. I'll carry them at once.

227
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,838
Thank you. You're such a hard worker.

228
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,091
{\an8}<i>The mistress was furious yesterday
because you had</i>

229
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,595
{\an8}<i>a scar on your forehead
when we took off the face powder.</i>

230
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,097
{\an8}-I won't trust that hot guy anymore!
-Please stop.

231
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,600
{\an8}Don't take it out on her!

232
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,354
Thank you for letting me work here.

233
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,361
Isn't she too strong?

234
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,528
You're right.

235
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,996
I heard the Kyogoku House's mistress
fell from the window and died.

236
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,333
That's frightening. We have to be careful.

237
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:04,129
There have been many Oiran
who deserted and disappeared lately.

238
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,839
It's scary.

239
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,008
What do you mean by "desert"?

240
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,094
That's a lot of baggage.

241
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,387
There.

242
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,473
These are presents for Koinatsu Oiran.

243
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,351
Haven't you heard, Sumi?

244
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:23,148
"Deserting" means "running away from here
without repaying your debts."

245
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,693
Bad things will happen if they catch you.

246
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,569
I see.

247
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,448
There are some who ran away
with their lovers, too.

248
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,201
The other day, Suma Oiran…

249
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,871
{\an8}<i>Suma? That's Uzui's wife.</i>

250
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,373
Listen.

251
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,251
Stop spreading gossip.

252
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:47,631
Nobody knows
whether they really ran away or not.

253
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,091
-Okay.
-Okay.

254
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,219
Thank you for carrying these.

255
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,637
Oh, yes.

256
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,847
Come here.

257
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,101
Let me give you some candy.

258
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,857
{\an8}Don't let others see you eat these.

259
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,442
I want some too.

260
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,277
Oiran!

261
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,488
{\an8}No, you can't.
You just ate some a while ago, right?

262
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,493
Did Suma Oiran really desert?

263
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,498
Why are you asking me that?

264
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,251
<i>She's being vigilant.</i>

265
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,296
<i>I have to explain myself carefully,
or she won't answer.</i>

266
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,381
Well…

267
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,884
I want candy.

268
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,179
Suma Oiran is my…

269
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,474
She's…

270
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:45,230
my older sister.

271
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,777
TANJIRO IS HONEST AND CANNOT HIDE
HIS EXPRESSION WHENEVER HE IS LYING

272
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,786
And you were sold here after your sister?

273
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,621
Yes.

274
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,500
We would usually exchange letters.

275
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,462
She's not the type to leave
without a good reason.

276
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,964
Is that so?

277
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:18,305
{\an8}I also never thought
that Suma would desert.

278
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,058
She was someone you could depend on.

279
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,520
<i>She doesn't seem to be the kind
who would obsess over a man.</i>

280
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,731
<i>But when we found her diary,</i>

281
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,985
<i>she wrote that she had decided to desert.</i>

282
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,196
<i>Desertion.</i>

283
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,075
{\an8}<i>The demons can use this motive
to their advantage.</i>

284
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,576
<i>When someone disappears,</i>

285
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,746
<i>people would think
that they had run away from the brothel.</i>

286
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,873
<i>The diary is most likely a distraction.</i>

287
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,584
{\an8}<i>I hope she's all right.</i>

288
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,088
<i>I'll save you no matter what, Suma.</i>

289
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,642
<i>Nothing unusual today, either.</i>

290
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,564
<i>I feel uneasy, but everything
seems to be concealed in smoke.</i>

291
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,026
<i>They're skilled at disguising
and covering their trails.</i>

292
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:19,783
<i>It's likely that Upper Rank demons
live around here.</i>

293
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,035
<i>If that's the case,</i>

294
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,581
<i>it's going to be one hell
of a flamboyant killing spree.</i>

295
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,462
<i>It's too hot!
I want to take my clothes off!</i>

296
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,550
<i>I feel like I'm losing my senses
wearing this stuff.</i>

297
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,803
Oh, my. Yae, do you have a moment?

298
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,890
Is Makio okay?

299
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,354
She has locked herself in her room
and won't come out.

300
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,817
She said she's not feeling well,
but she won't go to the clinic.

301
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,196
The mistress might kick her out
at this rate.

302
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,240
I just brought her some food.

303
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,327
I left it at the door of her room for now.

304
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,703
<i>Makio?</i>

305
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,371
<i>That's Uzui's wife.</i>

306
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,373
<i>I finally got to hear a familiar name.</i>

307
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,295
<i>She's not feeling well?
Is it really a reason to cut contact?</i>

308
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,341
That woman came from that way.

309
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,343
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

310
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,220
Oh, my, Inoko.

311
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,722
Don't run inside. You might slip.

312
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,854
She's so quiet.

313
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,527
<i>You have a coarse voice,
so never open your mouth.</i>

314
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,988
<i>You're not good
at faking your voice, either.</i>

315
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,823
<i>They'll find out right away
that you're a guy.</i>

316
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,158
<i>I'm serious.</i>

317
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,370
<i>What do you want me to do? Damn it!</i>

318
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:56,421
Now, answer me.

319
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,885
Now, answer me.

320
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,266
Who have you been sending
these messages to?

321
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,271
What was your name again?

322
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,108
Oh, I remember. You're Makio.

323
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,780
<i>You will answer me, Makio.</i>

324
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,250
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

325
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,502
What?

326
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,504
{\an8}<i>He's frustratingly good-looking.</i>

327
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,797
What's your problem?

328
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,341
Now let me tell you a Taisho-era secret.

329
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,887
Zenitsu likes the <i>shamisen</i> for some reason
and became quite good at playing it.

330
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,971
What?

331
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,723
{\an8}I'm too scared
at the brothel all by myself.

332
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,225
{\an8}Can I come and visit yours?

333
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,353
{\an8}I heard you're being liked
by the other workers there.

334
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,270
Really?

335
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,815
Then I'll try to be
the best Oiran in Yoshiwara!

336
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,108
MIRROR

337
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,277
{\an8}What happened?

338
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,655
{\an8}Next, episode 3, "Who Are You?"

339
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,198
{\an8}Zenitsu, are you okay?

340
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,241
Zenitsu!

341
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,242
TO BE CONTINUED
