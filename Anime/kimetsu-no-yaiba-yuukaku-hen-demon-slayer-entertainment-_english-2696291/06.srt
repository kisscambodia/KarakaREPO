1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,926
Since you pissed me off,
I'll kill you with my next blow.

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,726
<i>Raging Sun!</i>

4
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>Flame Dance!</i>

5
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,526
<i>This is nothing.</i>

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,444
<i>Is this…</i>

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,611
all you've got?

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,408
Where is he?

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,494
Hinokami Kagura: Fake Rainbow.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,373
I can do this!

11
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,752
Hinokami Kagura: Fire Wheel!

12
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,978
<i>Do a recovery breathing!</i>

13
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>I can fight an Upper Rank demon.</i>

14
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,193
Damn ugly, you're pissing me off!

15
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,888
<i>What's happening?</i>

16
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,891
<i>The obi's entering her body.</i>

17
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,267
<i>No.</i>

18
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,395
<i>The parts she detached before
are coming back?</i>

19
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,898
{\an8}UPPER RANK SIX

20
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,698
<i>Don't be afraid. Take a steady breath.</i>

21
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>Now!</i>

22
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,577
I was right.

23
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,996
<i>She disappeared?</i>

24
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,333
A Hashira…

25
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,837
A Hashira came.

26
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,589
Good.

27
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,718
My Lord will be pleased.

28
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,846
<i>Her appearance has changed.</i>

29
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,432
<i>What a sinister smell.</i>

30
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,143
<i>It makes my throat feel numb and painful.</i>

31
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,313
<i>She's more powerful than before.</i>

32
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,859
<i>Wait. Is Uzui with Inosuke and Zenitsu?</i>

33
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,861
<i>If so, I'm relieved.</i>

34
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,905
You guys are so noisy!

35
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,783
What's with that sword?

36
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,578
Don't quarrel in front of someone's door!

37
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,580
What kind of harassment is this?

38
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,125
<i>Crap! We made a ruckus.</i>

39
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,085
In this district,

40
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:58,047
everyone, including the customers,
must obey the rules!

41
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,175
We don't want people like you in here!

42
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,678
Get out of this district!

43
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,514
Look who's noisy now.

44
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,270
<i>This is bad.</i>

45
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,148
No! Get away from here!

46
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,858
Please step back!

47
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,990
Don't leave the building!

48
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,140
Hiro! No!

49
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,517
Stay calm.

50
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,313
You will be okay.

51
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,983
Bind your arm with a cord.

52
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,492
Wait.

53
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,039
I won't forgive you
after you have done all of this.

54
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,626
Jeez. You're still talking?

55
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,213
I've had enough of your ugliness.

56
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,716
Because hideous humans
don't deserve to live.

57
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,178
Get on with it and rot in death.

58
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,644
Hiro!

59
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,647
Please, someone, help us!

60
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,732
Don't come out, everyone!

61
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,027
It's dangerous! Go hide!

62
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,915
<i>Kamado, I'm sorry for what I did.</i>

63
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>Thank you for crying over Kyojuro.</i>

64
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:12,390
<i>I heard you've been exchanging letters
with Senjuro these past four months.</i>

65
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,018
<i>He's got a lot better.</i>

66
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,483
<i>I'm ashamed that our first meeting
turned out like that.</i>

67
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,904
<i>I was devastated by my own incompetence</i>

68
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,367
<i>when my beloved wife died of illness.</i>

69
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:37,290
<i>I went drinking and cowering.</i>

70
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,209
<i>What an unbelievable fool I am.</i>

71
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:46,507
<i>Unlike me, Kyojuro was an amazing son.</i>

72
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,845
<i>Even after I gave up on teaching him,</i>

73
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:56,058
<i>he read the manual of Flame Breathing,
trained himself, and became a Hashira.</i>

74
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,937
<i>With only three volumes of books.</i>

75
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:06,068
<i>It must be the traits from Ruka,
his mother.</i>

76
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,239
<i>Both Kyojuro and Senjuro
are wonderful sons.</i>

77
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,201
<i>And for you, Kamado,</i>

78
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,746
<i>you have more amazing power.</i>

79
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,458
<i>They say the chosen users
of the Sun Breathing</i>

80
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,671
<i>are born with a red birthmark
on their forehead, just like you.</i>

81
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,050
<i>So I'm sure, you're…</i>

82
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,678
<i>You're wrong, Mr. Shinjuro.</i>

83
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,057
<i>This isn't a birthmark.</i>

84
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,394
{\an8}<i>Originally, this is a burn scar I got
when I covered my brother</i>

85
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,730
<i>after he knocked over the brazier.</i>

86
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,775
{\an8}<i>It got wounded even more
during the Final Selection,</i>

87
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,944
<i>and that's how it ended up like this.</i>

88
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,824
<i>My father was born
with a thin birthmark on his forehead.</i>

89
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,826
<i>But not me.</i>

90
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:01,249
<i>I'm sure I'm not one of the chosen users.</i>

91
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,585
<i>Still…</i>

92
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,921
<i>But still…</i>

93
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:12,051
<i>Even though I'm not the chosen user,
even though I'm not strong enough,</i>

94
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:18,057
{\an8}<i>there are times
when I just can't back down.</i>

95
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,603
<i>Because there are beings in this world
who do not have a human heart.</i>

96
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:28,901
<i>They take lives irrationally
without remorse or regret.</i>

97
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,785
<i>I will never tolerate their cruelty!</i>

98
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,459
Lives that have been lost
will never return.

99
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,005
They are never coming back.

100
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,594
Our flesh and blood bodies
are unlike the demons'.

101
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,179
Why do you rob it?

102
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,182
Why do you trample on lives?

103
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,686
<i>I feel like I've heard those words
somewhere before.</i>

104
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,607
What is fun about it?

105
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,734
What is enjoyable about it?

106
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,655
What do you think lives are?

107
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,325
<i>Who's that? I don't know him.</i>

108
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,994
How could you not understand?

109
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,456
How could you forget?

110
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:29,420
<i>These are not mine.
These aren't my memories.</i>

111
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,088
<i>These are from the cells.</i>

112
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,923
<i>The memories of…</i>

113
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,886
<i>Lord Muzan's cells.</i>

114
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,026
Hey!

115
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,655
The obi worms scattered
and fled through the hole!

116
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,531
Shut up!

117
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,410
It's a good thing we saved
all these captured people!

118
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,290
Worship me first!
We'll talk about that later!

119
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,960
Sir Tengen, if you don't go after it,
it will cause more damage!

120
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,631
Don't worry about us, just go ahead!

121
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,554
Let's go after it, rascals!
Keep up with me!

122
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,058
Go faster!

123
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,563
Get out of the way!
The Great Uzui is coming through!

124
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,735
He's so damn fast!

125
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,158
What are you implying?

126
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,745
You were a human too, weren't you?

127
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,208
You used to shed tears because
you struggled with pain and suffering.

128
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,379
You just won't shut up, will you?

129
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,132
Why would I remember my past?

130
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,844
I'm a demon now, so it doesn't matter.

131
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,762
<i>Demons never grow old.</i>

132
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,723
<i>We don't even need money to eat.</i>

133
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,851
<i>We never get sick.</i>

134
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,477
<i>And we won't die.</i>

135
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,813
<i>We have nothing to lose.</i>

136
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,233
Furthermore,

137
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,235
the beautiful, strong demons

138
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,571
{\an8}can do everything they want!

139
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,698
Very well.

140
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,533
Enough.

141
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,204
Blood Demon Art:

142
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,710
Eight Layered Obi Slash!

143
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>You can't stop it, can you?
Because you're a fool.</i>

144
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,634
<i>This crossing blow has no way out.</i>

145
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:45,264
<i>I've been splitting my body to rule over
the entertainment district,</i>

146
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,977
<i>and when it becomes one with me,
its speed is unmatched.</i>

147
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,938
<i>You've had your hands full
with my normal attacks,</i>

148
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,483
<i>so it's impossible for you to parry it.</i>

149
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,776
<i>It's over for you. Farewell.</i>

150
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,863
<i>I'm going to slice you
along with your dull sword.</i>

151
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,660
<i>I'll go to the Hashira's whereabout.</i>

152
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,166
<i>Hinokami Kagura:
Burning Bones, Summer Sun.</i>

153
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,253
<i>It hurts!</i>

154
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,963
<i>What's with this pain?</i>

155
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,009
<i>The sections he cut hurt like hell.</i>

156
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,220
<i>I can't regenerate it well.</i>

157
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,096
<i>His wounds are supposedly deep.</i>

158
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>Normally, his body would tear apart
if he made such intense moves.</i>

159
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,651
<i>To begin with, why can he cut my obi?</i>

160
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,611
{\an8}<i>I've increased its hardness too.</i>

161
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,365
<i>My fingertips are trembling?</i>

162
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,991
<i>Is this me?</i>

163
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,245
<i>Lord Muzan's?</i>

164
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,834
<i>He's faster than before.</i>

165
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,670
<i>This is strange. This is wrong.</i>

166
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,755
<i>Does he not feel any pain?</i>

167
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,006
<i>Is he even a human?</i>

168
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,849
There's no way someone like you

169
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,478
can sever my head.

170
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,066
<i>It's elastic.</i>

171
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,360
<i>Too elastic to sever.</i>

172
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,946
<i>Its elasticity loosened up my slash.</i>

173
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,994
You're not getting away,
you ugly little shit!

174
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,789
<i>She's using more obi. Thirteen of them.</i>

175
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,293
<i>If I dodge them,
the damage could spread again.</i>

176
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,962
<i>But somehow,</i>

177
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,965
<i>they're very slow.</i>

178
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,969
I won't let you cut them this time!

179
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,055
It was just a pure coincidence
that you reached my neck earlier!

180
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,356
<i>He parried them with the sword ridge
and gathered them in one place.</i>

181
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,236
Is that supposed to stop me?

182
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,405
I'll send you flying!

183
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,160
<i>Is he planning to cut my obi
by not letting them loosen up?</i>

184
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,496
<i>But I can extend them
in the blink of an eye.</i>

185
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:19,084
<i>As if he can do anything
from that distance in a split second--</i>

186
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,176
<i>What? Did he cut them?</i>

187
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,261
<i>So fast.</i>

188
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,138
<i>It's simple.</i>

189
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,517
<i>I just have to swing my sword and sever
her head faster than it can loosen up.</i>

190
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,146
<i>I can do it this time. I can sever it.</i>

191
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,523
Tanjiro!

192
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,031
Tanjiro, breathe! Please!

193
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,174
It's miserable to be a human, isn't it?

194
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:12,972
No matter how desperate you are,
it's sad you can only go this far.

195
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,848
{\an8}<i>I can't stop coughing.</i>

196
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,101
{\an8}<i>It's painful to breathe.</i>

197
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,438
{\an8}<i>I already passed my physical limit
a while ago.</i>

198
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,525
<i>My vision is going dark.</i>

199
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,987
<i>I can only hear my own heartbeat.</i>

200
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,825
Oh, well, your wounds won't heal easily.

201
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,952
Of course, that's how it goes.

202
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,957
<i>Hold up your sword.</i>

203
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:45,295
In return, I'll cut your head off.

204
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,786
How dare you kick me?

205
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,204
You…

206
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,541
It was you, wasn't it?

207
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,669
You are the one my Lord talked about!

208
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,843
Daki, there's a demon
who has escaped my control.

209
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,928
Just like Tamayo.

210
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,432
Find and kill her.

211
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,101
You're the only one I can ask.

212
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:48,609
She's wearing a kimono
with hemp leaf pattern and checkered obi.

213
00:17:55,115 --> 00:18:01,538
Of course, as you wish.
I'll torture her to death, my Lord.

214
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,631
All you can do is kick, huh?

215
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,760
You small-fry demon!

216
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,356
So weak.

217
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,733
I bet you didn't eat humans.

218
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,403
How can you escape from my Lord's control?

219
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,532
What a poor thing.

220
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,827
Your torso is torn apart, you see.

221
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,037
You'd better not move.

222
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,957
A half-assed like you can't regenerate

223
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,294
those severe wounds immediately.

224
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,674
Since we're of the same demon kin,
I won't bully you anymore.

225
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:58,804
I'll trap you within my obi, and let
the sunlight burn you when morning comes.

226
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:03,058
It would be a waste of time
if the demons tried to kill each other.

227
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,066
What?

228
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,402
<i>Wait a minute. What the hell?</i>

229
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,612
<i>Her legs had already regenerated.</i>

230
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,825
<i>Not only that, but how can she stand?</i>

231
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,035
<i>I cut her body in half a little while ago.</i>

232
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,538
<i>She resisted my attack.</i>

233
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,748
<i>I'm sure I've torn it apart.</i>

234
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,259
<i>The speed of her regeneration just now</i>

235
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,761
<i>is even comparable
to the Upper Rank Demons.</i>

236
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,449
<i>What's with this pressure?</i>

237
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,870
<i>She suddenly got more menacing.</i>

238
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,959
<i>Tanjiro…</i>

239
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,340
<i>Both you and Nezuko are really similar.</i>

240
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,968
<i>You both are gentle, but scary when mad.</i>

241
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,638
<i>A long time ago,</i>

242
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,934
<i>Nezuko got mad at a rude adult
who bumped and injured a little child.</i>

243
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,853
<i>She was angry
and told the adult to apologize.</i>

244
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,525
<i>It's a good thing there were
a lot of adults around back then.</i>

245
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,487
<i>But I was scared.</i>

246
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,658
<i>People who get angry
for the sake of others</i>

247
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,576
<i>often lack concern for themselves.</i>

248
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:52,334
<i>I'm scared that one day she might lose
something precious because of it.</i>

249
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,218
<i>Another kick?</i>

250
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,513
Fools always repeat what they do!

251
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,973
Next is your head!

252
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,912
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

253
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,081
Monjiro!

254
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,834
We're coming to save you right now,
so don't die before we arrive!

255
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,797
How can you run in your sleep?

256
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,550
Can you see what's ahead?

257
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,553
How about this?

258
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,683
Man, you've never done this before.

259
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,186
And where's the God of Festivals?

260
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,063
You're so slow!

261
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,815
God of Festivals!

262
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,110
We don't have time
for the Taisho-era secret.

263
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,654
{\an8}Next, episode 7, "Transfiguration."

264
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,490
Don't waste time here! Let's go!

265
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,908
TO BE CONTINUED
