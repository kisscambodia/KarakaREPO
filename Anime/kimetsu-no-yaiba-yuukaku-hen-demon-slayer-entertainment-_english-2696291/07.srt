1
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:39,993
<i>Why is the leg I cut off
penetrating my back?</i>

2
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,078
<i>She regenerated in an instant?</i>

3
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,496
<i>Impossible!</i>

4
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>That means her regeneration ability…</i>

5
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,421
<i>is more superior to mine.</i>

6
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,896
<i>Tanjiro!</i>

7
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,071
{\an8}Tanjiro, help her!

8
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,616
Nezuko is…

9
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,493
not being herself!

10
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,382
Move it, you little shit!

11
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,726
I'll cut you into pieces
and trap you within my obi!

12
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>She stopped it with her severed limbs?</i>

13
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,284
<i>No, it's still connected.
Her blood solidified.</i>

14
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,293
<i>I'm on fire because of her blood spurts.</i>

15
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,754
<i>It's like that time.</i>

16
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,631
<i>Fire…</i>

17
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,840
<i>Fire!</i>

18
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,315
Nezuko!

19
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,776
Don't! Hold it!

20
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,614
Don't! Control yourself, Nezuko!

21
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,996
{\an8}I'm sorry!

22
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,956
{\an8}Sorry for making you fight!

23
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,045
<i>I can smell Nezuko's blood
all over the place.</i>

24
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:23,424
<i>I know how much she was hurt
while I was unconscious.</i>

25
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,261
I know, it must have hurt,
and was painful.

26
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,472
I'm sorry, but it's okay.

27
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,101
{\an8}I won't let anyone hurt you!

28
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,436
{\an8}Go to sleep, Nezuko!

29
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
Sleep and recover yourself!

30
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,399
Nezuko!

31
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,152
Nezu…

32
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,326
What's happening?

33
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,954
Someone broke through from below!

34
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:59,210
Nezuko, go to sleep!

35
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,758
How dare you do that to me?

36
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,054
So you can even use Blood Demon Art?

37
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,100
A bizarre Blood Demon Art
that only burns demons.

38
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,520
{\an8}Besides, I can't heal it very well.

39
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,565
{\an8}This has extremely pissed me off.

40
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,859
{\an8}Extremely.

41
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,610
<i>This is bad.</i>

42
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,363
<i>There are people here.
I have to protect them.</i>

43
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,531
<i>Think!</i>

44
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,032
{\an8}<i>Think before you act!</i>

45
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,827
<i>Her attacks will come soon.</i>

46
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,037
<i>They can even cut the buildings.</i>

47
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,790
{\an8}<i>Is it okay to let go of Nezuko?</i>

48
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,001
{\an8}<i>No. What should I do?</i>

49
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,128
<i>Protecting people is my priority.</i>

50
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,424
SLAYER

51
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,142
Hey.

52
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,353
Isn't this Nezuko Kamado?

53
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,273
Her demonization is going flamboyantly.

54
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,110
Uzui…

55
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,447
You've made a big show of it
in front of the master,

56
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,240
and this is how it turns out?

57
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,910
{\an8}No one is asking her to progress
her demonization flamboyantly!

58
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,827
What?

59
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,998
So the Hashira came by himself.

60
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,459
It saved me a lot of time.

61
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,046
Shut up. I'm not talking to you.

62
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,214
Begone.

63
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,217
You're not an Upper Rank Demon, are you?

64
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,011
Because you're too weak.

65
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,015
You're not what I've been looking for.

66
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,519
What nonsense are you talking about?

67
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,151
What?

68
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,030
Damn it!

69
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,450
We lost the God of Festivals!

70
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,953
At this rate, we'll be overtaken by him!

71
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,913
Overtaken flamboyantly!

72
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,466
Oh, you found him?

73
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,723
I'm the King of The Mountains!
Lord Inosuke is coming through!

74
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,940
<i>He…</i>

75
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,150
<i>He severed…</i>

76
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,735
{\an8}<i>He severed her head!</i>

77
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,990
<i>Her head fell off. Did Uzui do it?</i>

78
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>Amazing!</i>

79
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,411
Hey.

80
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,246
The fight isn't over yet.

81
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,498
Do something about your sister.

82
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,501
Nezuko!

83
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,218
Dumb brats who grumble around
have no place on the battlefield.

84
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,221
Sing her a plain lullaby or something.

85
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,410
<i>It's no use. My voice isn't reaching her.</i>

86
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,038
<i>She's not listening to me at all.</i>

87
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,375
<i>What should I do, Mother?</i>

88
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,922
Sing her a plain lullaby or something.

89
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:40,181
<i>Fast asleep
Oh, little bunny from the hill</i>

90
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:45,353
<i>Why are your ears so long?</i>

91
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,106
<i>Because when I was little</i>

92
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,034
<i>My mother ate long leaves</i>

93
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,371
<i>That's why my ears</i>

94
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:08,876
{\an8}<i>Are so long</i>

95
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,974
<i>Nezuko.</i>

96
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,645
<i>Nezuko.</i>

97
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,945
<i>Fast asleep</i>

98
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,240
<i>Oh, little bunny from the hill</i>

99
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,829
<i>Why are your eyes so red?</i>

100
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:52,253
<i>Because when I was little</i>

101
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:58,050
<i>My mother ate red berries</i>

102
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:05,224
<i>That's why my eyes are so red</i>

103
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,604
Does Tanjiro have red eyes

104
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:16,694
because you ate red berries
when he was in your tummy?

105
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,303
Nezuko…

106
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,331
{\an8}She's asleep.

107
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,251
Mother, she's asleep.

108
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,170
She slept.

109
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,131
Uzui…

110
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,550
<i>Hold on!</i>

111
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,177
Where are you going?

112
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,679
How dare you cut my head off?

113
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,306
You'll pay for this!

114
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,768
You're still babbling, I see.

115
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,813
I have no business with you,
so die plainly.

116
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,607
Stop screwing around!

117
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,028
A while ago,
you said I'm not an Upper Rank!

118
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,447
In fact, you're really not.

119
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,908
I'm Upper Rank Six!

120
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,661
If so, why was your head cut off?

121
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,787
You're too weak.

122
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,664
Is your brain completely dead?

123
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,750
{\an8}I haven't lost!

124
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,126
{\an8}Because I'm an Upper Rank!

125
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,671
{\an8}It's clearly visible that you've lost.

126
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,590
I'm actually strong!

127
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,803
I'm just number six for now,
but I'll get stronger from now on!

128
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,805
{\an8}You're not convincing.

129
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,648
I'm really Upper Rank Six!

130
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,901
I'm serious! I even have the number!

131
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,153
I'm actually amazing!

132
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,906
<i>Really? She's throwing a tantrum.</i>

133
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,324
<i>No.</i>

134
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,660
<i>More importantly, how can she still talk?</i>

135
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,789
<i>I severed her head,
but her body isn't disintegrating.</i>

136
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,749
Die!

137
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,751
You all must die!

138
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,970
My head got cut off!
I've been decapitated!

139
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,807
Gyutaro!

140
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,248
It's no use crying, you know.

141
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,753
At least attach your own head yourself.

142
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:25,633
You're not very smart, are you?

143
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,260
<i>I've chopped her head off,
but she's still alive.</i>

144
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,221
<i>And what's the other one
that came out of her back?</i>

145
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,974
<i>His reaction speed is abnormal.</i>

146
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,852
Did your face get burned?

147
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,732
You have to take care
of your face, you know.

148
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:46,904
Since you've been born with a pretty face.

149
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,871
Oh, wow. You're good.

150
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,582
You stopped my attack.

151
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,169
Although I tried to kill you.

152
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,839
Not bad. You're good.

153
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,427
You're really good, you know.

154
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:15,808
You're good-looking.
Your skin is nice, too.

155
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,937
No spots, no bruises,
and even no scars, you know.

156
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:26,193
You're fleshy, too.
I can't get any fatter, you know.

157
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,153
Not to mention, you're tall.

158
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,950
It's clearly over 180 centimeters.

159
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:37,663
I bet you're popular with the girls.

160
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,124
I'm jealous.

161
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,376
So jealous, you know.

162
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,753
Could you just die?

163
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,507
Die in a painful way.

164
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,677
I'll skin you alive,

165
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,931
cut your belly open, and so on.

166
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,102
Gyutaro, it's not just him,
there are more of them.

167
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,188
Definitely kill the girl who burned me!

168
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,275
I've been doing my best!

169
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,737
I've been working very hard,
all by myself!

170
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,867
<i>But you know what?
They got in my way and bullied me!</i>

171
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,579
They kept bullying me!

172
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:24,126
I see, now. That's unforgivable.

173
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,215
My cute little sister has been
doing her best with her small brain.

174
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,220
I'm going to kill you guys
who bullied her.

175
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,849
I'll collect the debts.

176
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,811
You guys will pay for every scar
you've dealt on my sister.

177
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,023
I'll make you go round and round
when you die.

178
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:50,319
Because my name is Gyutaro!

179
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,203
<i>What are those? Sickles?</i>

180
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,415
<i>Those sickles bare spinning
and going back inside…</i>

181
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,627
<i>It's not the same weapon
as the obi demon used earlier.</i>

182
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,128
<i>What's the meaning of this?</i>

183
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,755
<i>Is it a new demon?</i>

184
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,632
{\an8}<i>I smell Uzui's blood.</i>

185
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,634
{\an8}<i>I have to help him.</i>

186
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,762
{\an8}I'm here, you dipshit!

187
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,014
I've arrived, dumbass!

188
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,266
Rely on me!

189
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,519
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

190
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,813
Zenitsu, are you sleeping?

191
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,692
Please go back up Uzui, you two!

192
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,903
I've got you covered, don't worry!

193
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,780
I'm going to go on a rampage!

194
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,660
I, Lord Inosuke, will fight flamboyantly!

195
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,370
Thank you.

196
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,539
I'll put Nezuko back in the box.

197
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,290
Sorry, but give me some time!

198
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,333
I allow it!

199
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,417
Thank you!

200
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,343
You make me so jealous.

201
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:01,056
{\an8}You're a really good man, you know.

202
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:06,228
You're protecting humans to look good.

203
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,605
What a good guy.

204
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:14,153
In their eyes,
you're their savior, you know.

205
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:19,950
I'm sure you'll be liked and appreciated.

206
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,410
Of course.

207
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,289
That's a given because
I'm a flamboyant, gorgeous, hot guy.

208
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,708
I even have three wives.

209
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,797
You've got three wives?

210
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,091
Don't screw with me!

211
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,968
You…

212
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,221
You're unforgivable!

213
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,935
Blood Demon Art: Flying Blood Sickles!

214
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,814
<i>Slashes of blood like a thin blade…</i>

215
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,193
<i>I can't stop this many
while protecting people.</i>

216
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,781
What? An explosion?

217
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,784
He fell downstairs.

218
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,411
Run! Go hide yourselves!

219
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,746
Okay!

220
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,249
You're not getting away, you know.

221
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,752
Bend, Flying Blood Sickles.

222
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,595
<i>He can control the slashes?</i>

223
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,890
<i>The slashes of blood move
until they hit the enemy and burst.</i>

224
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,350
<i>What's with those siblings?</i>

225
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,228
<i>His sister is still alive
even after her head was chopped off.</i>

226
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,396
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

227
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,733
<i>Will they die altogether
if I chop the brother's head off?</i>

228
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,402
<i>Is the brother the main body?</i>

229
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,615
<i>I'll have to do it anyway.</i>

230
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,161
<i>Judging from the sound,
most of the people upstairs have escaped.</i>

231
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,087
That was close!

232
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:06,598
Well, of course, it's not that easy.

233
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,856
After all,

234
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,820
we're two-in-one, you know.

235
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,621
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

236
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,333
Today, let's go straight
to the Taisho-era secret.

237
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:01,713
Since Nezuko was a child, she has always
been obedient and has never been selfish.

238
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:06,009
Even when our grandma
or when our father passed away,

239
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,886
<i>she said this to our younger siblings,</i>

240
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,721
<i>"We feel the same sorrow."</i>

241
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:14,768
<i>"Grandma and Father can't rest in peace
if we cry all the time,</i>

242
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,022
<i>so after we cry a lot today,
let's do our best again</i>

243
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,482
<i>and always smile."</i>

244
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,530
Next, episode 8, "Gathering."

245
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,282
Nezuko is really a good girl.

246
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,909
