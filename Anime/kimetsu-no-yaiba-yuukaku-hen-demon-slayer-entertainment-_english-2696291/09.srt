1
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>Please work.</i>

2
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>Even for just a few moments.</i>

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,570
<i>And then,</i>

4
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,865
<i>someone will cut his neck for sure.</i>

5
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:29,816
UZUI FAMILY'S GRAVE

6
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,664
{\an8}If my siblings were still alive,

7
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,003
{\an8}then maybe there would be a day
when we all could have a drink.

8
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,424
Sorry, but I don't want to die yet.

9
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,970
Since I've brought you a nice sake,
forgive me.

10
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,309
{\an8}Someday we'll have a drink together
in the afterlife.

11
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,069
Let's eat flamboyantly for them too.

12
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,450
Oh, my! This is delish!

13
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,452
You three should eat more too.

14
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,163
Lord Tengen…

15
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,081
Yes?

16
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,001
About your deceased siblings…

17
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,920
Do you still remember it?

18
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,846
Yes, I've never forgotten about it.

19
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,770
It feels like it was only yesterday
when I left the village with you.

20
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,737
This one is delish too.
You should try it now.

21
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,615
-Okay.
-Okay.

22
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,830
Yes, it's delicious.

23
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,084
Why don't you show a little restraint?

24
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,710
It's okay.

25
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,630
Lord Tengen already told us to eat.

26
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,548
This is for you, Makio!

27
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,010
It's good.

28
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,387
Right?

29
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,559
I'm going to hell one day.

30
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,231
Well, it's no good saying that.

31
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,859
I've been scolded enough by you.

32
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,824
{\an8}I'm going to live my life flamboyantly

33
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,201
{\an8}for the sake of my siblings.

34
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,788
Along with you three.

35
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,165
-Yes.
-Yes.

36
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,094
It's so beautiful.

37
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,562
Thank you.

38
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,521
You're welcome.

39
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,441
Lord Tengen!

40
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,943
Here. Me too!

41
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,321
You put those on yourself, didn't you?

42
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,157
Lord Tengen, you're cruel!

43
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:29,454
Lord Tengen, can I have that flower petal?

44
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:33,291
I don't mind, but there are
plenty of them around here.

45
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,002
I want the one that you picked.

46
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,091
Thank you very much.

47
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,764
-Lord Tengen, me too!
-Lord Tengen, me too!

48
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,890
What?

49
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,892
Just pick it
from the ones scattered around.

50
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,853
-You're cruel!
-You're cruel!

51
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,648
{\an8}<i>Lord Tengen!</i>

52
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,033
<i>His legs already regenerated?</i>

53
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,453
{\an8}<i>Goddamn it! The poison in him wore off.</i>

54
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:16,626
{\an8}Well, the poison actually worked,
you know.

55
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,127
Blood Demon Art:

56
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,883
{\an8}Rotating Circular Slashes,
Flying Blood Sickles!

57
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,847
<i>He can slash this wide
without swinging his arms?</i>

58
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:39,607
Sound Breathing, Fourth Form:
Constant Resounding Slashes!

59
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,575
<i>He's gone?</i>

60
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,538
Lord Tengen, watch out! Behind you!

61
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,793
{\an8}Hinatsu--

62
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,170
I'll attract the obi!

63
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,507
Don't mind me! Just find the demon--

64
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,763
How dare you!

65
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,351
{\an8}And I do mind you, you know.

66
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
Hinatsuru!

67
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,358
Shit! The obi are blocking me!

68
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,988
Hinatsuru!

69
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,743
Oh, my!

70
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,996
It's beautiful, Lord Tengen!

71
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,208
I want to be a dragonfly and fly.

72
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,837
What a flamboyant dream you've got.

73
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,965
You're being silly again, aren't you?

74
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,010
What? Of course, I'm not!

75
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,595
Makio, you idiot!

76
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,347
What did you say?
I dare you to say that again!

77
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,151
Lord Tengen.

78
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,613
Once we've defeated the Upper Rank demons,

79
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:13,910
let's step back from the frontline
and live as normal human beings.

80
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:21,626
I know it will not bring back the life
that was taken from us as ninjas,

81
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,464
but we have to decide at some point,

82
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,384
or we will be ashamed
to live in this country.

83
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,888
Even if the four of us
are not together at the time,

84
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,517
there will be no hard feelings.

85
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,192
{\an8}Stop it!

86
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,947
<i>Move!</i>

87
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,865
<i>Move!</i>

88
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,118
<i>She will be killed!</i>

89
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,162
<i>Someone will be killed
in front of me again!</i>

90
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>Get closer! Jump to the roof!</i>

91
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,918
<i>I can't stand
being protected all the time!</i>

92
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,128
<i>Be useful even for just a little!</i>

93
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,760
<i>He's not being wary of me
because I'm weak.</i>

94
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,430
<i>I can save her
if I make an unexpected move.</i>

95
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,853
<i>Use the Kagura.
A Hinokami Kagura technique.</i>

96
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,897
<i>I can get close if I use that.</i>

97
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,987
<i>Damn, I can't.</i>

98
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,656
<i>I don't have enough stamina
to do the stance.</i>

99
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,409
{\an8}<i>What should I do? Quick! Think quickly!</i>

100
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,619
<i>What should I do at a moment like this?</i>

101
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,620
{\an8}<i>Think!</i>

102
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,790
{\an8}<i>Think about what would be
the best thing I could do right now!</i>

103
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,252
<i>The best thing I could do is…</i>

104
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,859
<i>His move was pretty fast.</i>

105
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:19,327
<i>He shouldn't be able
to move this much anymore.</i>

106
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>I did it!</i>

107
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,417
<i>Mix the breathing techniques.</i>

108
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,504
<i>Use Water Breathing
and Hinokami Kagura together.</i>

109
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,634
<i>By doing so, my attack power becomes
stronger than Water Breathing alone,</i>

110
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,303
<i>and I can move longer than
when I'm using Hinokami Kagura alone.</i>

111
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,892
{\an8}<i>Every swordsman
who has ever fought demons has done so.</i>

112
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,354
<i>They combined the breathing techniques
with their sword skills</i>

113
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:51,901
<i>and altered them into forms that
could display their greatest strength.</i>

114
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,445
<i>That's how
the breathing techniques diverged.</i>

115
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,951
<i>No matter what form,
it can be altered to be more flexible.</i>

116
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,581
{\an8}<i>That's the fighting style
that Master Urokodaki taught me.</i>

117
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,632
<i>Even though I can't master
Water Breathing like Tomioka,</i>

118
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:19,053
{\an8}<i>I won't waste
what Master Urokodaki has taught me!</i>

119
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,516
{\an8}Either way, you'll die!

120
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,316
Tanjiro Kamado!

121
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,486
I offer you my deepest thanks!

122
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,827
Damn it!

123
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,663
They're fluttering everywhere!
It's so annoying!

124
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,167
They're freaking hard
even though they squirm!

125
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,838
There's no end to this!

126
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,510
Oh, crap!

127
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,012
The demon over there is close
to having his head chopped off!

128
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,181
Inosuke, watch out for the next attack!

129
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,853
Damn it!

130
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,439
We can't beat them
unless we chop their heads off together!

131
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,358
<i>We're running around trying
to distract her</i>

132
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,360
<i>and managed to avoid her attacks,</i>

133
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,821
<i>but avoiding them is pointless.</i>

134
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,450
<i>We have to get closer and aim at her neck.</i>

135
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,338
Inosuke, calm down!

136
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,674
{\an8}We don't have to literally sever it
at the same time!

137
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,802
{\an8}Just make sure that their heads
are not connected!

138
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,935
Even after our friends severed his head,

139
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,229
don't give up and just keep attacking!

140
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,441
You…

141
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,861
Aren't you looking pretty cool?

142
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,488
What happened?

143
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,035
{\an8}<i>Don't just idle around!
I have to aim at his head too!</i>

144
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,870
<i>We can do this!</i>

145
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,918
He doesn't even flinch.

146
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:24,220
{\an8}There's no way you guys
can cut my head off, you know.

147
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,432
<i>I can't swing my sword.</i>

148
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,112
<i>Don't casually rotate your head
180 degrees, you dumbass!</i>

149
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,449
<i>Is he going to do it again?</i>

150
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,618
Kamado, hold your ground!

151
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,749
Uzui!

152
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,752
Lord Tengen!

153
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,878
Uzui--

154
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,840
That was dangerous!

155
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,642
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

156
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,273
Take this!

157
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,402
We've got no choice
and have to change our strategy!

158
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,822
We can't get close to Worm-Girl at all!

159
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:29,618
Let's beat her with the three of us,
and leave the mantis-guy to that old man!

160
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,580
She's weaker than the sickle guy.

161
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,248
Let's sever her head first!

162
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,667
Tanjiro, can you still move?

163
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,307
I can.

164
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,644
But Uzui is in a bad situation
because he's been poisoned by the enemy.

165
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,439
We have to settle this
as soon as possible!

166
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,569
<i>That was dangerous.
The attacks barely hit me.</i>

167
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,906
<i>Even though he's fighting against Uzui,
the blood blades are still coming.</i>

168
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:12,077
-Hinatsuru!
-Don't worry about me. I will hide.

169
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,829
Just think about winning!

170
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,414
Watch out! Behind you!

171
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,049
Are you okay?

172
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,675
Yes, thank you.

173
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,723
I see that
you're getting slower and slower.

174
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,976
Who will be the first to die?

175
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,519
<i>Shit!</i>

176
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,105
<i>Monichi and I are pretty much woundless.</i>

177
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,024
<i>We have to do something.</i>

178
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,735
<i>That old man is already worn out.</i>

179
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,821
{\an8}<i>What have I trained for?</i>

180
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,157
<i>All the training…</i>

181
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,493
<i>For what purpose?</i>

182
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,162
Inosuke!

183
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,540
This demon's neck is too flexible to cut!

184
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,125
Either slash it very fast

185
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,672
or get her head from multiple directions!

186
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,970
<i>When the obi are going towards Tanjiro,</i>

187
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,721
<i>the attacks are slightly…</i>

188
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,641
<i>The attacks are slightly loosening.</i>

189
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,685
That's what I feel!

190
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,895
I'll think that way no matter what!

191
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,035
In terms of multiple-direction slashing,
leave it to me, the dual-wielding user!

192
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,872
The three of us can win!

193
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,624
Understood!

194
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,002
Zenitsu, let's protect Inosuke!

195
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,336
{\an8}All right!

196
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,427
One more ugly kid won't change anything!

197
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,729
Inosuke!

198
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,816
Here I go! Get close to me, boys!

199
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,573
Beast Breathing…

200
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,745
Eighth Form:

201
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,039
Explosive…

202
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,000
Rush!

203
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,594
Water Breathing, Third Form…

204
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,309
Thunder Breathing, First Form…

205
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,738
…Flowing…

206
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,906
{\an8}…Thunderclap and Flash…

207
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,785
-…Dance!
-…Eightfold!

208
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:20,140
<i>He doesn't care about defense,
and focuses on charging forward.</i>

209
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,690
I'll be settling with this.

210
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,694
<i>No, you won't. You can't behead me…</i>

211
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,572
<i>with these battered swords.</i>

212
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,118
Sixth Fang…

213
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,003
UPPER RANK SIX

214
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,006
…Palisade Bite!

215
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,976
You did it, Inosuke!

216
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,729
<i>Amazing! He used his swords like a saw.</i>

217
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,110
Head! It's her head!

218
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,446
I'll take it far away,
so it won't stick again!

219
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,834
I'll be taking this head
and running around for the time being!

220
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,670
You guys help that old man!

221
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,838
Understood!

222
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,548
Be careful, Inosuke!

223
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,716
All right!

224
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,759
<i>Uzui!</i>

225
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,016
<i>Hurry, we must help him.</i>

226
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,772
{\an8}You shitty boar! Let go of my head!

227
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,488
Your attack was dull.

228
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,324
What did you say?

229
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,034
You may not be dead,

230
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,662
but after I chopped off your head,
the vital point, you've become a weakling.

231
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,797
Inosuke!

232
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,633
<i>Inosuke! </i>

233
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,426
<i>This is bad. He got poisoned.</i>

234
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,012
<i>Is he wounded? Did his heart get stabbed?</i>

235
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,680
<i>It's so dark, I can't see.</i>

236
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,432
<i>Damn it!</i>

237
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:30,062
<i>Why is he here? Where is Uzui?</i>

238
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,813
<i>Uzui!</i>

239
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,065
{\an8}DESTROYER OF DEMONS

240
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,068
SLAYER

241
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,946
Tanjiro, watch out!

242
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,659
<i>Crap!</i>

243
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,496
<i>Zenitsu, don't mind me.</i>

244
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,418
<i>This happened because I looked away.</i>

245
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,462
<i>I'm sorry, Inosuke.</i>

246
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,839
<i>If only I had realized it earlier…</i>

247
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,549
<i>No.</i>

248
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,930
<i>This wouldn't be happening
if I hadn't left Uzui in the first place.</i>

249
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,391
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

250
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,685
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

251
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,645
<i>I'm sorry, everyone.</i>

252
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,734
<i>I'm sorry, Nezuko.</i>

253
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,911
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

254
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,582
{\an8}Beast Breathing, Eighth Form:
Explosive Rush!

255
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:59,377
Thunder Breathing, First Form:
Thunderclap and Flash Eightfold!

256
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,507
{\an8}Water Breathing, Third Form:
Flowing Dance!

257
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,349
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

258
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,226
Uzui!

259
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,730
After we fought this hard,
we still can't win?

260
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,358
Don't give up.

261
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,068
Don't give up!

262
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,569
Don't ever give up!

263
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,656
Next, episode 10, "I Will Never Give Up."

264
