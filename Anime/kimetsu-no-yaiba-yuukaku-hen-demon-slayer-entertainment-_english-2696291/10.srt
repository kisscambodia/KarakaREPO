1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,918
SLAYER

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,169
{\an8}DESTROYER OF DEMONS

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,298
Tanjiro, watch out!

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>Crap!</i>

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,682
<i>Zenitsu, don't mind me.</i>

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,354
<i>This happened because I looked away.</i>

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,314
<i>I'm sorry, Inosuke.</i>

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,942
<i>If only I had realized it earlier…</i>

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>No.</i>

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:33,283
<i>This wouldn't be happening
if I hadn't left Uzui in the first place.</i>

11
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,912
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,914
<i>I'm sorry, everyone.</i>

14
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,145
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,397
<i>I'm sorry, everyone.</i>

16
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>I'm sorry, Nezuko.</i>

17
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,410
Don't apologize, Tanjiro.

18
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,207
Why do you always apologize?

19
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,502
Are you unhappy because we are poor?

20
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,922
Do you feel sorry because
you couldn't give me a beautiful kimono?

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,092
Do you want to blame
someone else so badly?

22
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,971
You made Father dying from his disease
a bad thing too.

23
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:05,560
It can't be helped if we tried our best
but it didn't work out

24
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,478
because we are humans.

25
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,399
Not everything will go our way,
not only us, but for everyone.

26
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,612
Decide our happiness by ourselves.

27
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,615
It's the "present" that matters.

28
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,829
Let's look forward,
do our best, and fight together.

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,124
Don't apologize.

30
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,002
You should know
because you are my brother.

31
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,964
You should know my feelings!

32
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,808
An old dream…

33
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,187
What? Where am I?

34
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,189
Am I…

35
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,037
<i>This is so terrible.</i>

36
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,331
<i>To think it became like this…</i>

37
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,461
<i>I wonder if all the people here
were able to escape.</i>

38
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,713
Nezuko!

39
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,842
Nezuko…

40
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,470
Thank you, Nezuko.

41
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,391
<i>I'll do what I can.</i>

42
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,311
Really? You're still alive?

43
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,816
You're lucky, you know.

44
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:40,280
Well, I guess you got nothing
except luck, though.

45
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,246
I feel sorry for you.

46
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:53,501
Everyone else besides you
pretty much died immediately.

47
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,005
I stabbed that boar's heart.

48
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:01,384
That yellow head is suffering
from being crushed by rubble,

49
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,678
so I'm leaving him there to die.

50
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:08,516
He's just trying to crawl around
pathetically like a bug.

51
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,477
The Hashira was weak too.

52
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,438
He was good at showing off.

53
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,775
But his heart stopped
because of the poison, and then died.

54
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,527
He's a goner.

55
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,404
Pathetic.

56
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,114
So pathetic.

57
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,783
You're all so pathetic, you know!

58
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,619
Especially you!

59
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,039
So it's your blood relative

60
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,458
that's sticking out of the box
you're carrying, isn't it?

61
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,585
I know it very well.

62
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,963
Even though she became a demon,
you two still act like family.

63
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,759
Is she your older or younger sister?

64
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,723
<i>Why didn't he kill me?</i>

65
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,058
<i>What is it?</i>

66
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>My arms are still numb.</i>

67
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,771
<i>My stamina hasn't recovered yet.</i>

68
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,107
<i>Even if I aim for his head now,
I won't be able to sever it.</i>

69
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,360
Nezuko is…

70
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,322
my younger sister.

71
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,999
As I figured. You're really pathetic.

72
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,795
You couldn't protect your sister at all.

73
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,090
Well, I don't blame you.

74
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,552
You're a human. Meanwhile, she's a demon.

75
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,431
Of course, you're weaker
than your demon sister,

76
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,810
but still, you're so pathetic.

77
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,770
As an eldest,

78
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:41,067
you should protect your sister,
not be protected by her.

79
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,862
Protect her with your hands.

80
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,705
{\an8}Hey. How are you feeling now?

81
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,708
{\an8}Isn't it a shame
that you're the only survivor, right?

82
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:03,464
Your sister, your last ray of hope,
pretty much used up all her strength.

83
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,009
How does it feel? Insect. Dimwit.

84
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,346
The coward among dunces. Useless.

85
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,599
Why were you born?

86
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,476
So what now?

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,019
Now try to cut my head

88
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:23,192
{\an8}with your weak, fragile, ragged,
miserable human body!

89
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,861
Come on! Try it!

90
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,487
{\an8}Now!

91
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,501
What?

92
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,219
I see now.

93
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,680
Your spirit broke in the last second.

94
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,807
How pathetic!

95
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,518
You're so pathetic, you know!

96
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,120
So pathetic.

97
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,789
You're so pathetic.

98
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:24,253
You're the most pathetic person
I've ever seen.

99
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:55,284
You're pathetic, but I don't hate you.

100
00:08:55,368 --> 00:09:01,290
I like things that are miserable,
dirty, and pathetic.

101
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,253
You have a dirty scar on your forehead.

102
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,965
It's nice. I kind of like it.

103
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,299
Right!

104
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,885
How about you become a demon too?

105
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,804
For your sister!

106
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,265
Yes, right. That's it.

107
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,809
I'll help you if you become a demon.

108
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,978
Because we'll be friends.

109
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,773
If you don't,
I'll beat your sister to death too.

110
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:30,069
I don't really care about
other people's sisters, you know.

111
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,947
I object, Gyutaro! Don't give him ideas!

112
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,408
I absolutely disagree.

113
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,076
{\an8}Once you become a demon,

114
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,995
{\an8}you'll be strong in an instant,

115
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,290
{\an8}and say goodbye to your crippled body.

116
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,252
So are you interested?

117
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,136
You're frustrated
by your own weakness, right?

118
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,764
When people grieve,
they look up to the sky.

119
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,435
So the tears won't pour down.

120
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,607
I…

121
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,694
I was preparing.

122
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,577
<i>A desperate headbutt
is meaningless, you know.</i>

123
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,457
<i>I can't move my body very well.</i>

124
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,292
What are you doing, Gyutaro?

125
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,418
Stand up! Hurry!

126
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,794
<i>This is weird.</i>

127
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,172
<i>What the hell is happening?</i>

128
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,924
<i>It was just a human's headbutt.</i>

129
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,056
<i>A</i> kunai?

130
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,224
<i>He headbutted
and stabbed me at the same time.</i>

131
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,395
<i>This kid pretended to run away,
but he wanted to pick this up.</i>

132
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
<i>He threw the prostitute's scent bag
and the rubble at me</i>

133
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,735
<i>to conceal the smell
of the</i> kunai<i>'s poison.</i>

134
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,070
<i>This guy…</i>

135
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,741
<i>This guy is just a weak human being!</i>

136
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,160
<i>Even after I gave him a beating</i>

137
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,288
<i>and showed the huge difference
between our strengths…</i>

138
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,124
<i>Why hasn't he given up yet
despite being all alone?</i>

139
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,584
<i>Why is his spirit not broken yet?</i>

140
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,712
<i>Why is his will to beat me…</i>

141
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,632
<i>not wavering?</i>

142
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,182
<i>Tanjiro.</i>

143
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,850
Tanjiro!

144
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,105
Tanjiro!

145
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,650
Gyutaro!

146
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:42,118
<i>If one circumstance went differently,</i>

147
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,996
<i>I probably would have ended up
in his situation.</i>

148
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,875
<i>I've been lucky enough to stay as a human.</i>

149
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,922
<i>But we probably could have had a future
where we were both demons.</i>

150
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,387
<i>If I ever became a demon,</i> <i>I'm sure…</i>

151
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:08,602
<i>someone from the Demon Slayer Corps
would cut my head off.</i>

152
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,364
<i>Cut through!</i>

153
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,702
<i>This will be our win!
We're going to win for sure!</i>

154
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,831
This can't be happening!

155
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,083
Don't let him cut your head off!

156
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,677
He got out of the rubble!

157
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,095
{\an8}Don't interfere, you ugly human!

158
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,935
<i>Thunder Breathing, First Form…</i>

159
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,771
I know how fast your technique is.

160
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,398
I've seen it so many times.

161
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,444
{\an8}<i>…Thunderclap and Flash,</i> <i>God Speed!</i>

162
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:02,907
<i>So fast.</i>

163
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,537
<i>My head is about to get cut.</i>

164
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,708
<i>This is bad.
I didn't know he could move this fast.</i>

165
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,294
<i>Cut through! Break through!</i>

166
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,924
<i>I can only use God Speed twice,
then my legs will become useless.</i>

167
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,177
<i>I've used it once to get out
of the rubble, so I can't use it again.</i>

168
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,431
<i>And now is the only chance
to get her head.</i>

169
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,226
<i>Tanjiro made this
once-in-a-lifetime chance.</i>

170
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>I'll definitely cut her head off for sure!</i>

171
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,027
<i>Crap! I can't cut it through.</i>

172
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,278
<i>It's too rigid.</i>

173
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,864
<i>The poison should have weakened him.</i>

174
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,534
<i>Am I still not strong enough?</i>

175
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,583
<i>He has already recovered from the poison.</i>

176
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,585
<i>He wants to drag me in and rip me apart.</i>

177
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,421
<i>My sword is pushed back.</i>

178
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,134
<i>I was so close.</i>

179
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>I almost severed his head.</i>

180
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,474
<i>Don't give up!</i>

181
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,726
<i>Keep attacking to the very end!</i>

182
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,770
{\an8}You shitty brat!

183
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,276
<i>His attack speed is increasing.</i>

184
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,613
<i>The poison is starting to wear off.
He's back to his full strength.</i>

185
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,200
<i>Don't give up!</i>

186
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,121
<i>Don't give…</i>

187
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,416
DESTROYER OF DEMONS

188
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>He's not dead? How come he's still alive?</i>

189
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,594
<i>Wasn't his heart…</i>

190
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,928
<i>I see!</i>

191
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,223
<i>He forced his heart to stop
with his muscles,</i>

192
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:55,060
<i>so the poison stopped circulating
in his body temporarily.</i>

193
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,395
Uzui!

194
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,314
The Musical Score is finally complete!

195
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,316
We're going to win!

196
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,694
Don't make me laugh!

197
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,533
One!

198
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,245
Three, seven, five, twelve, thirteen!

199
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,080
{\an8}I can read your movements

200
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,667
from your filthy melody!

201
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,716
<i>He deflected
all of my Rotating Circular Slashes?</i>

202
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,842
Amazing!

203
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,973
<i>Musical score?</i>

204
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,308
<i>The musical score, he said?</i>

205
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,895
<i>Don't tell me he read my Blood Demon Art
as a piece of music and deflected it?</i>

206
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,898
<i>Not to mention, he's only got one arm!</i>

207
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,359
<i>That's impossible!</i>

208
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,070
Such bullshit!

209
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,366
<i>Amazing. They're evenly matched.</i>

210
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,660
<i>But at this rate, we can't win.</i>

211
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,870
<i>Uzui will reach his limit first.</i>

212
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:42,209
<i>Before that happens,
I have to sever the demon's head!</i>

213
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,260
Uzui!

214
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,762
Don't stop! Jump!

215
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,727
<i>You damn dunce, you're slow!</i>

216
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,772
<i>No matter how good the setup,
a weakling is still weak.</i>

217
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,317
<i>It's over. You'll die by my poison.</i>

218
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,112
<i>Cut it off! Sever his head!</i>

219
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,697
<i>I won't give up!</i>

220
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,450
<i>I will sever it for sure!</i>

221
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,873
<i>This idiot is still swinging his sword.</i>

222
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,918
<i>You couldn't cut my head off
just before, you know!</i>

223
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,547
<i>Don't use arms strength alone!
Swing it with my whole body strength!</i>

224
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,675
<i>Use everything from
the top of my head to my toes!</i>

225
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,304
<i>Forget all the pain in my body!
Just strike him!</i>

226
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,682
<i>If a full-body blow isn't enough,</i>

227
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:43,937
<i>then squeeze out
a hundred times the power!</i>

228
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,989
<i>Damn it! It's just a brat.</i>

229
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,117
<i>This is bad. I'm going to be decapitated.</i>

230
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,081
<i>Wait. I'll be fine.</i>

231
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,668
<i>Even if my head gets cut off,
my sister's head is still attached.</i>

232
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,755
<i>I'll deal with this yellow head first!</i>

233
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,513
<i>Crap! My stamina won't make it.</i>

234
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:23,936
I'll slice you into little pieces
before you can cut my head off!

235
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,899
<i>Why is he here?</i>

236
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,443
<i>Wasn't his heart stabbed by my brother?</i>

237
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,405
Don't underestimate
the flexibility of my body!

238
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,202
Shifting the position of my organs
is no sweat for me!

239
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:45,207
I've grown up on a rugged mountain,
so the poison won't do me any good!

240
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,630
{\an8}Gyutaro!

241
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,508
{\an8}Do something, Gyutaro!

242
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,680
{\an8}<i>I have to use Rotating
Circular Slashes now!</i>

243
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,437
They did it.

244
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,272
They beheaded the demons.

245
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,815
They really did it!

246
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,153
They did it, Hinatsuru!

247
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,363
Even though you're dying, please look!

248
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,949
What are you even saying?

249
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,201
-What?
-Silly!

250
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,577
It hurts!

251
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,247
Wait. Something is wrong.

252
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:20,385
<i>Delay the poison
with a breathing technique.</i>

253
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:27,100
{\an8}<i>Delay it from circulating,
even just a little.</i>

254
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,562
Stand up, Kamado!

255
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,980
-It's not over yet!
<i>-What is it?</i>

256
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,358
<i>Are you saying something?</i>

257
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,821
<i>Did I fail to sever his head?</i>

258
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,367
-Run! It's not over yet!
<i>-Uzui is…</i>

259
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,161
<i>saying something.</i>

260
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,039
Run!

261
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,202
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

262
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,706
{\an8}Tanjiro!

263
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,374
{\an8}Are you okay, Tanjiro?

264
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,628
Don't give up, Tanjiro.
You have to stay alive.

265
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,215
Here's a Taisho-era secret
about my brother

266
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,885
who has been through many crises.

267
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:11,014
{\an8}My brother's rock-like head
is a trait of our mother.

268
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,892
<i>It was a story from when I was little.</i>

269
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,523
{\an8}<i>I heard she fought off a boar
with a headbutt.</i>

270
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,235
Next, the last episode,
"No Matter How Many Times We Reborn."

271
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,945
I believe in you, Tanjiro.

272
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,030
I know you will definitely win.

273
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,406
