1
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,342
Kamado!

2
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,264
Stand up, Kamado!

3
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,724
-It's not over yet!
<i>-What is it?</i>

4
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,018
<i>Are you saying something?</i>

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:05,523
<i>Did I fail to sever his head?</i>

6
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,693
-Run! It's not over yet!
<i>-Uzui is…</i>

7
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,571
<i>saying something.</i>

8
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:15,075
Run!

9
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,252
Nezuko…

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,438
It's awful.

11
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,941
It's all a mess.

12
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,196
Did you save me?

13
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,656
Thank you.

14
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,452
Right. Where are the others?

15
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,709
<i>I can't move my body.</i>

16
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>Wait. How can I move to begin with?</i>

17
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,923
<i>Why am I still alive?</i>

18
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,925
<i>Didn't I get poisoned?</i>

19
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,470
{\an8}Tanjiro!

20
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,139
It's Zenitsu's voice.

21
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,308
Tanjiro!

22
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,311
Help me!

23
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,984
{\an8}Tanjiro!

24
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,862
{\an8}When I woke up, my whole body is in pain!

25
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,156
Are my legs broken?

26
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,743
What happened? Who did this to me?

27
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,996
It hurts! I'm too scared to look!

28
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,831
I'm glad you're okay.

29
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,499
No, I'm not okay!

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:33,254
You should feel bad for me,
but Inosuke is much worse!

31
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,383
His heartbeat is getting
weaker and weaker!

32
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,594
Where is Inosuke?

33
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,889
There he is! Right there!

34
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,229
{\an8}Inosuke!

35
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,981
Inosuke! Stay with me, Inosuke!

36
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,274
Inosuke!

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,573
<i>His heartbeat is really getting weaker.</i>

38
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>I have to do something about the poison.</i>

39
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,745
<i>Right! How about the sunlight?</i>

40
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,539
<i>It's still dark.</i>

41
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>What should I do?</i>

42
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,710
<i>Send a crow to Shinobu?</i>

43
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,796
<i>No, it will be too late.</i>

44
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,966
<i>If I don't do something now,
Inosuke will die.</i>

45
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,010
<i>Why was I saved?</i>

46
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,304
{\an8}<i>Why only me?</i>

47
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,857
His skin, which is inflamed by poison,
is getting healed.

48
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,739
I'm hungry! Give me some food!

49
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,992
Inosuke!

50
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,287
Thank goodness!

51
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,124
-Thank goodness!
-Stop it! That's creepy.

52
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:58,006
No! Don't die!

53
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,509
Please don't die, Lord Tengen!

54
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:06,139
We've managed to survive and win!

55
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,850
No! I don't want to!

56
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,477
What can we do about the demon's poison?

57
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,397
The antidote isn't working!

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,232
You're so cruel, Gods!

59
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,484
So cruel!

60
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,116
I have one final thing to say.

61
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,119
My whole life up until now--

62
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:32,832
If you let Lord Tengen die,
I won't be praying to gods anymore!

63
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,002
And I won't ever forgive you!

64
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:40,423
Shut up, will you?
Lord Tengen is speaking!

65
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,426
I will put stones in your mouth,
you silly woman!

66
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,428
Please be quiet, both of you!

67
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,183
{\an8}Makio is bullying me!

68
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,310
{\an8}-Shut up, you idiot!
<i>-Are you kidding me?</i>

69
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,189
{\an8}<i>-Am I going to die without saying a thing?</i>
-She's really putting stones!

70
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,440
{\an8}Stop it, you two!

71
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,359
{\an8}<i>Now I can't move my tongue
because of the poison.</i>

72
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,361
{\an8}-Stop it!
<i>-Why is this happening?</i>

73
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,488
{\an8}Don't make a fuss!

74
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,115
{\an8}<i>I should have the time
to say some final words.</i>

75
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,826
{\an8}<i>Oh, man.</i>

76
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,163
What?

77
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,174
What are you doing? And who are you?

78
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,927
No matter what the reason is,
it's too early for cremation!

79
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,930
He's not even dead yet
and you're already burning him!

80
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,266
I'll spank your butt
because you've made me angry!

81
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,434
Hold on.

82
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,396
What the hell is going on here?

83
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,900
{\an8}The poison is gone.

84
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,655
-Lord Tengen!
-Lord Tengen!

85
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,160
{\an8}I'm so glad.

86
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,961
I've made you worry.

87
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,842
{\an8}I think Nezuko burned and removed
the poison using her Blood Demon Art.

88
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,678
{\an8}Well, I don't understand it either.

89
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,932
{\an8}It didn't heal your wounds, though.
Please don't move for now.

90
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,351
{\an8}I'm glad you're okay.

91
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,020
Is that even possible?

92
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,106
-I'm so confused.
-Thank you!

93
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,859
Wait. You shouldn't move either
or you'll die.

94
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,026
Thanks!

95
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,279
I'll look for the demons' heads.

96
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,740
I can't be at ease
until I confirm it myself.

97
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:39,292
Nezuko, I smell
the demon's blood over there.

98
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>A puddle of blood?</i>

99
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,300
<i>It's the demon's blood.</i>

100
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,726
<i>Okay, there's no coming attack.</i>

101
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,152
<i>I got the blood of the Upper Rank Demon.</i>

102
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,408
Give this to Miss Tamayo.

103
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,581
I'm counting on you.

104
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,964
There's no one here.

105
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,259
I guess Makio and the others
managed to get everyone out.

106
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,636
Thank goodness.

107
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,933
Nezuko, there.

108
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,476
Go over there.

109
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,021
<i>The scent of the demons
is getting stronger.</i>

110
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,568
How could you let those two small fries
chop your head off?

111
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,695
I thought you were watching me!

112
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,989
Why didn't you save me?

113
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,451
I was fighting the Hashira!

114
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,288
{\an8}So what? Why couldn't you finish him off?

115
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,457
You should have cracked his head open!

116
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,792
I was going to!

117
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,709
What?

118
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,295
The brat with the earring was still alive,

119
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,631
so I thought I should
get rid of him first!

120
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,051
You didn't do anything in the first place,

121
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,595
so you should have at least finished
the Hashira first!

122
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,391
Then why didn't you
just manipulate me to do that?

123
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,768
And yet you did nothing!

124
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,852
You let your guard down!

125
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,980
-You're so annoying!
<i>-They are still alive.</i>

126
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,857
-If you want to be called "Upper Rank…"
<i>-Moreover, they are in a quarrel.</i>

127
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,901
-…you should be able to kill two…
<i>-But their heads…</i>

128
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,070
-…wounded underlings by yourself, idiot!
<i>-…are slowly disintegrating.</i>

129
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,405
You're the idiot one!

130
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,406
What did you say?

131
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:46,085
There's no way an ugly guy like you
could ever be my sibling.

132
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,758
I'm sure we're not blood-related at all!

133
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,969
Because we don't even look alike!

134
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,971
You're useless!

135
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,724
The only good thing about you
is you're strong!

136
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,225
Nothing else!

137
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,854
Once you lose,
you're no longer worth anything!

138
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,815
You're a good-for-nothing,
ugly piece of shit!

139
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,947
You've got to be kidding!

140
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,658
If you were on your own,
you would be dead already!

141
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,910
How many times do you think
I've saved you?

142
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,497
You're the one who's good-for-nothing.

143
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,709
You're weak and don't have any merit.

144
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,922
{\an8}I'm regretting all the times
I've protected a girl like you.

145
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,595
If it wasn't for you,
my life would have been different!

146
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,222
{\an8}If it wasn't for you!

147
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,353
{\an8}Why do I have to clean up
your mess all the time?

148
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,272
{\an8}I wish you had never been bo--

149
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,318
That's a lie.

150
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,780
You don't really feel that way.

151
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,616
It's all lies.

152
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,744
Just try to get along.

153
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,122
Because you only have each other
as siblings in this world.

154
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,835
No one will ever forgive you
for what you've done.

155
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,965
You're hated and despised
by all the people you've killed.

156
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,761
No one will be your ally.

157
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,472
So at least the two of you…

158
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,184
shouldn't be cursing each other.

159
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,772
SIX

160
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,532
Don't be bossy!

161
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:44,120
Don't lecture us, you brat!

162
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,914
Go away! Go somewhere else!

163
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,794
This sucks!

164
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,004
This is vexing!

165
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,299
Do something, Gyutaro!

166
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,928
I don't want to die, Gyutaro!

167
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,888
Gyutaro!

168
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,306
Gyuta--

169
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,643
Ume!

170
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,647
{\an8}<i>That's right.</i>

171
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:17,027
{\an8}<i>My sister's name was Ume, not Daki.</i>

172
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>That's a terrible name.</i>

173
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>Well, Ume was a terrible name too.</i>

174
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:37,256
<i>Because you were named
after the disease our mother died from.</i>

175
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,344
<i>Rashomon River Bank,
the place we were born.</i>

176
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,472
<i>The lowest class
of the Entertainment District.</i>

177
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,432
<i>Children are a burden</i>

178
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,102
<i>because they cost a lot of money
for food just to stay alive.</i>

179
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,690
<i>I was almost killed several times
before I was born.</i>

180
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,985
<i>Even after I was born,
she thought I was nothing but a burden,</i>

181
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,571
<i>and she tried to kill me many times.</i>

182
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,741
<i>And yet I survived.</i>

183
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:10,206
<i>My body was as weak as a dead branch,
but I was struggling to survive.</i>

184
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>"Insect."</i>

185
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,876
<i>"Dimwit."</i>

186
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,586
<i>"The coward among dunces."</i>

187
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,046
<i>"Useless."</i>

188
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,091
<i>They mocked me
for my ugly voice and appearance.</i>

189
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,969
<i>They called me "dirty"
and threw stones at me.</i>

190
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:32,269
{\an8}<i>As if all the abusive language
in the world was made for me.</i>

191
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,233
<i>I was ugly and dirty.</i>

192
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,277
<i>I was always covered in dirt and dandruff.</i>

193
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,614
<i>I smelled terrible
and had fleas all over me.</i>

194
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,369
<i>In the Entertainment District,
where beauty was the only criterion,</i>

195
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,205
<i>I was particularly frowned upon.</i>

196
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,749
<i>Like a monster.</i>

197
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,295
<i>When I was hungry, I ate rats and bugs.</i>

198
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,801
<i>My plaything was a sickle
that a customer forgot and left behind.</i>

199
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,557
<i>Something started to change inside me</i>

200
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,977
<i>when Ume was born.</i>

201
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,982
<i>Ume.</i>

202
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,361
<i>You were my pride.</i>

203
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,989
<i>Even at a young age,</i>

204
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,784
<i>you had a very beautiful face
that made adults falter.</i>

205
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:37,293
<i>I realized I was good at fighting,
so I started working as a collector.</i>

206
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,255
<i>Everyone was creeped out and afraid of me.</i>

207
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,425
<i>I felt great.</i>

208
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,055
{\an8}<i>I became proud of my ugliness.</i>

209
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,977
<i>Having a sister as beautiful as you</i>

210
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,188
<i>had blown away my inferiority complex.</i>

211
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,444
<i>I had a feeling that our lives</i>

212
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:07,448
<i>would accelerate and turn
for the better from then on.</i>

213
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,956
<i>Until you turned 13.</i>

214
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:31,263
<i>You blinded a samurai customer
by poking him in the eye with a hairpin.</i>

215
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:36,852
<i>As retaliation,
you were tied up and burned alive.</i>

216
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,689
{\an8}<i>I wasn't there.</i>

217
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,653
{\an8}<i>When I came back from work,
you were burnt to a crisp.</i>

218
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,999
No! Stop!

219
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,502
Don't collect from me!

220
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:05,839
You didn't give me anything,
but you dare collect something from me!

221
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,383
Unforgivable!

222
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,468
I will never forgive you!

223
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,096
Turn my sister back to normal!

224
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:18,227
If you don't, I will kill you all,
even the gods and Buddha!

225
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,820
Are you sure it's this guy?

226
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,406
Yes, I'm sure.

227
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,326
Thank you very much
for getting rid of this troublesome kid.

228
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,954
He's very violent.

229
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,039
He had injured people
before he collected from them,

230
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,959
and recently,
no one was unable to stop him.

231
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm really sorry about what Ume did.

232
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,424
If I find a lovely girl,
I will introduce her to you again.

233
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,968
Oh, and about the money…

234
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,471
Wait a minute. Not until I finish him off.

235
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,690
What?

236
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,154
You have a nice kimono, you know.

237
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,409
You have a clean and good skin tone too.

238
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:22,499
You must have eaten a lot of food
and slept in a tidy bed.

239
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,546
I bet you got nice things
since you were born.

240
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,341
You live in a house
that shelters you from wind and rain.

241
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,887
I'm jealous.

242
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,474
What a nice life, you know.

243
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,689
As for the rich guy
who lost a mere eyeball,

244
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,817
don't make such a fuss.

245
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,993
Just shut up.

246
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,669
<i>Nobody would help us.</i>

247
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,755
<i>It happens all the time.</i>

248
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,801
<i>It was our everyday life as usual.</i>

249
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,222
<i>There was always no one to help us.</i>

250
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,686
<i>The snow had started to fall.</i>

251
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,151
<i>At all times,
everything was relentless against us.</i>

252
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,572
<i>Why is that?</i>

253
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,451
<i>The fortunes and misfortunes
are intertwined, right?</i>

254
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:44,248
<i>The good and the bad come in turns.</i>

255
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,547
What's the matter here? How pitiful.

256
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,844
{\an8}Since I'm a nice guy,
I can't just leave you.

257
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,057
She'll be dead soon, I believe.

258
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,729
I'll give my blood to both of you.

259
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,818
{\an8}You can become demons
if you're chosen by my lord.

260
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,491
Life is a precious thing.

261
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,286
You must treasure it.

262
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,455
Well then…

263
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,000
Both of you shall become demons.

264
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,670
Can you join the Twelve Kizuki…

265
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,632
and become an Upper Rank just like me?

266
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,967
UPPER RANK SIX

267
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,847
<i>I have no regrets about being a demon.</i>

268
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,312
<i>No matter how many times I'm reborn,
I will always be a demon.</i>

269
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,356
<i>I won't allow others to be happy.</i>

270
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,360
{\an8}<i>I'll always be Gyutaro the Collector
who collects from them.</i>

271
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:03,118
<i>But if I had just one regret…</i>

272
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>Ume, maybe you shouldn't have been with me
because we are different.</i>

273
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:19,468
<i>If you had been in a better brothel,
you would have been a proper Oiran.</i>

274
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:26,516
<i>If you had been born to normal parents,
you would have been a normal girl.</i>

275
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:35,025
<i>If you had been born into a good family,
you would have been an elegant girl.</i>

276
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,490
<i>You had a straightforward personality
that was easy to influence.</i>

277
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:46,036
<i>You turned out the way you did
because I raised you.</i>

278
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,373
<i>"Snatch them away before they do."</i>

279
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,209
<i>It's because I taught you to collect,</i>

280
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,462
<i>you poked the samurai in the eye.</i>

281
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,632
<i>But if you had stayed obedient,</i>

282
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:03,428
<i>you might have walked on a different path.</i>

283
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,814
<i>My only regret…</i>

284
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,025
<i>is you.</i>

285
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,122
What's this place? Is this hell?

286
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,332
Gyutaro!

287
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,169
I hate this place!

288
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,838
Where are we?

289
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,799
I want to get out! Do something!

290
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,926
You…

291
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,846
That appearance…

292
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,269
Is that the way out?

293
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,483
You don't have to follow me anymore.

294
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,361
Why?

295
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,904
Wait. I--

296
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,948
{\an8}Don't follow me!

297
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,119
Are you angry about what I said earlier?

298
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,455
I'm sorry, so forgive me!

299
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,333
{\an8}I don't think you're ugly, Gyutaro!

300
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,336
{\an8}I was frustrated!
I was disappointed to lose!

301
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,673
{\an8}I didn't want to admit
that we had lost because of me!

302
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm sorry for being a failure!

303
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,015
If I had been more useful,
we wouldn't have lost!

304
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,893
I'm sorry for always holding you back!

305
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,063
Hey, Gyutaro!

306
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,904
We're no longer siblings or anything.

307
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,326
I'll go this way.

308
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,331
You go to the other side,
the brighter side.

309
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,504
Hey!

310
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,340
No, I don't want to!

311
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,511
{\an8}I won't leave you! I will never leave you!

312
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,846
{\an8}I'll be with you forever!

313
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:16,103
{\an8}No matter how many times I'm reborn,
I'll definitely always be your sister!

314
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,940
Don't hate me! Don't scold me!

315
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,275
Don't leave me alone!

316
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,195
I won't forgive you if you leave me!

317
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,705
We're going to be together forever.

318
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,000
You meanie! Bully!

319
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,711
Don't you remember what you promised me?

320
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,051
<i>Have you forgotten?</i>

321
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,892
<i>We're strongest when we're together.</i>

322
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,771
<i>Whether we're cold or hungry,
we'll be perfectly fine.</i>

323
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,859
<i>I promise. We'll be together forever.</i>

324
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,069
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

325
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:10,699
<i>See? There's nothing to be afraid of now.</i>

326
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,627
{\an8}I wonder if they have made up.

327
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,554
It's finally over.

328
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,057
I'm tired.

329
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,646
I see.

330
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,982
Six, huh?

331
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,320
The weakest Upper Rank.

332
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,241
The "six" thing aside,
you've defeated an Upper Rank.

333
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,160
Congratulations to you.

334
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,329
It's "six," though.

335
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,083
I'll give you a compliment.

336
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,044
No, I don't need a compliment from you.

337
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,379
That's right!

338
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,214
You're pretty late.

339
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,883
It's too late to come in the first place!

340
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,968
You're late!

341
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,596
Scary!

342
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,600
Why did you lose your left hand
and your left eye?

343
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:06,314
How long will it take you to recover
after battling with a mere Upper Rank Six?

344
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,734
Who's going to fill your place
while you recover?

345
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,112
I'm retiring.

346
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,614
I can't fight anymore.

347
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,701
I'm sure our master will forgive me.

348
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,621
Don't be ridiculous. I won't forgive you.

349
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,208
Right now, too many youngsters are dying
because they can't grow up.

350
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:29,254
A Hashira spot still remains vacant
after Rengoku's death.

351
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,716
Having you there is better
than losing you.

352
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,385
Fight until you die.

353
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,138
-No, the youngsters are growing up.
-Hinatsuru, my neck is twisted!

354
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,973
-That's for sure.
-You're twisting my neck!

355
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,893
I mean, the youngster you hate so much.

356
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,647
Hey.

357
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,776
Don't tell me he survived…

358
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,321
<i>this battle?</i>

359
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,741
<i>That Tanjiro Kamado survived?</i>

360
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,461
<i>Great! They did defeat an Upper Rank!</i>

361
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,589
Well done, Tengen, Tanjiro,

362
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:16,968
Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke!

363
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,972
Master Kagaya!

364
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,433
A hundred years…

365
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,686
Our situation has remained unchanged
for a hundred years,

366
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,230
but now it has changed!

367
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,608
-Amane…
-Yes?

368
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,948
Do you understand? This is an omen.

369
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,911
Fate is starting to change dramatically.

370
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,914
The ripples will continue to spread.

371
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,376
It will shake the surroundings.

372
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,880
And eventually, it will reach the man.

373
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,591
Muzan Kibutsuji.

374
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:02,722
{\an8}We will definitely defeat you
within our generation.

375
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:07,268
{\an8}You are the only disgrace
to our entire family.

376
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,315
Kids, boil some water!

377
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,651
And bring the towel and the medicine!

378
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,777
Quickly!

379
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,778
Father!

380
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,696
-Father!
-Father!

381
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,785
{\an8}THREE

382
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,371
{\an8}UPPER RANK

383
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,712
<i>This is the Infinity Castle.</i>

384
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,842
<i>The fact I have been summoned here means…</i>

385
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,930
{\an8}<i>an Upper Rank was killed
by the demon hunters.</i>

386
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,274
Damn it! It hurts!

387
00:28:55,066 --> 00:29:00,029
But I'm glad, Lord Tengen!

388
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,784
I'm really glad we're still alive.

389
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,581
The four of us can go home
without losing someone.

390
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,376
Yes, let's make a triumphant return.

391
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,420
Flamboyantly, of course!

392
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:25,680
{\an8}-Thank goodness we're still alive!
-Yes!

393
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:35,482
{\an8}I'm glad you're all alive!

394
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,402
{\an8}THE END
