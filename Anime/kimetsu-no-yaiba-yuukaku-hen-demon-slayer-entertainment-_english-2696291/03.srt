1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:05,338
EDO, YOSHIWARA

2
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,028
Hey!

3
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,363
Since you came,

4
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,743
how many prostitutes do you think
have vanished at this brothel?

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,663
What are you doing in the shadows?

6
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:49,168
TOKYO, YOSHIWARA

7
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,467
I see. So this is the Ogimoto House.

8
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,401
OGIMOTO HOUSE

9
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,321
Now, answer me.

10
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,243
Who have you been sending
these messages to?

11
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,539
What was your name again?

12
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,209
Oh, I remember. You're Makio.

13
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,424
You will answer me, Makio.

14
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,061
KYOGOKU HOUSE

15
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,023
<i>I feel like I'm losing it.</i>

16
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:56,319
<i>I should be searching for Hinatsuru,
one of Uzui's wives.</i>

17
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,824
<i>Just being good at playing</i> shamisen
<i>won't get me anywhere.</i>

18
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>But what should I do?</i>

19
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,498
{\an8}<i>I've been listening
to this brothel's situation,</i>

20
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,334
{\an8}<i>but I haven't found anything
about Hinatsuru.</i>

21
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,963
<i>Besides, the owner's wife died
just two days ago.</i>

22
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,716
<i>Everyone became gloomy and silent.</i>

23
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,471
Can you bring that over here?

24
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,014
I can't find my obi!

25
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,849
I'm hungry.

26
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,643
Is the hairdresser here?

27
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,607
It's an emergency.

28
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,734
A girl is crying.

29
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,656
Oh, someone is coming.

30
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,868
There are too many busybodies
at Ogimoto House.

31
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,789
<i>I have to tell him somehow.</i>

32
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>Lord Tengen…</i>

33
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:03,469
Try making a ruckus,
and I'll twist your guts.

34
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,977
<i>Those are the meals that the woman left.</i>

35
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,397
<i>So that's Makio's room.</i>

36
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,067
<i>Something is definitely not right.</i>

37
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,528
<i>Is she in a real pinch right now?</i>

38
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,405
<i>It's hard to tell.</i>

39
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,326
<i>It feels sickeningly creepy.</i>

40
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,500
{\an8}But sitting here
and doing nothing is not how I roll!

41
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,474
<i>I can feel the air moving,
but the windows are shut.</i>

42
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,436
<i>It's the ceiling.</i>

43
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,689
Hey, you jerk!

44
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,149
I know you're up there!

45
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,487
What's going on?

46
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,324
It's rattling around in the ceiling.

47
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,287
<i>I knew it! It's a demon!</i>

48
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,082
{\an8}<i>Where is it going?
Where is it escaping to?</i>

49
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,710
Out of the way!

50
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,379
You're not running away!

51
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,634
What's happening?

52
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,429
<i>Since it's daytime right now,
it went upstairs.</i>

53
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,850
<i>But there should be a wall
it uses to climb down.</i>

54
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,357
Right there!

55
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,111
{\an8}Oh, look at you, cutie--

56
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,950
She punched him!

57
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,663
<i>Damn it! I messed up.</i>

58
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,456
<i>It's going downstairs.</i>

59
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,833
Over here?

60
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,796
No, it's this way.

61
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,632
Damn it.

62
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,218
It's hard to follow.

63
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,220
{\an8}I've lost it.

64
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:13,015
{\an8}Bastard! It's because
someone got in my way.

65
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,860
What? It's a mess!
What happened in this room?

66
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,866
{\an8}What? A fight?
Was there a fight in here? Are you okay?

67
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,371
Hey.

68
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,415
Are you hurt?

69
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,877
Hey, calm down.

70
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,713
I wasn't mad at you.

71
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,049
I'm sorry. If you need help…

72
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,598
What are you doing in my room?

73
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,315
<i>The person behind me now is a demon.</i>

74
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,108
<i>It's not a human sound.</i>

75
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,529
<i>I wasn't aware of her
before she called out to me.</i>

76
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,531
<i>How is this possible?</i>

77
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,909
<i>She sounds dangerous.</i>

78
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,578
<i>It's so quiet, it creeps me out.</i>

79
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,584
{\an8}<i>Is she…</i>

80
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,046
<i>an Upper Rank Demon?</i>

81
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,134
Hey, are you deaf?

82
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,514
Warabihime Oiran…

83
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:39,101
She started working here
just a few days ago.

84
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,524
So what?

85
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,904
I'm sorry for trespassing.

86
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,991
The room is cluttered,
and I saw her crying.

87
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,537
You're so ugly.

88
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,997
It's not even funny.

89
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,000
You're really better off dead.

90
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,628
What's with your hair color?

91
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,506
Are you trying to stand out?

92
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:16,264
You have a point, however.
This room is in shambles.

93
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,977
Didn't I tell you to clean it up?

94
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,982
Shut up!

95
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,151
{\an8}Stop crying! Clean this room up!

96
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,196
{\an8}I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

97
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,700
{\an8}I'll do it right away. Please forgive me.

98
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,291
What?

99
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,337
{\an8}Please get your hands off of her.

100
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,217
TOKITO HOUSE

101
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:18,034
{\an8}Mistress, I've cleaned up the hallways
and taken care of watering the plants.

102
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,286
What? Already?

103
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,121
What should I do next?

104
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,416
Next is…

105
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,629
Here's some fresh hot tea, mistress.

106
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,589
Thank you.

107
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,757
It's nothing.

108
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,092
What's next, mistress?

109
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,345
{\an8}What's next, mistress?

110
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,471
{\an8}Mistress!

111
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,349
{\an8}You're too nosy. Please stop for a second.

112
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,937
She's quick and takes her work seriously.

113
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:01,077
That new girl wrecked our brothel.

114
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,664
I need to teach her a lesson.

115
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,916
Hey, Inoko!

116
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,543
What are you doing?

117
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,672
<i>I still can't feel its presence
even while focusing.</i>

118
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,717
<i>Where did that thing go?</i>

119
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,151
What did you say?

120
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,529
Say it again.

121
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,824
Please get your hands off of her.

122
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,120
The more I look at you,
the uglier you get.

123
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,122
{\an8}Please--

124
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,750
{\an8}Don't you dare touch me.

125
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,091
TWO DAYS BEFORE

126
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,968
TANJIRO AND HIS FRIENDS

127
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,719
INFILTRATED

128
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,721
KYOGOKU HOUSE

129
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
That's enough!

130
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,728
What are you implying?

131
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:16,193
Our workers kept getting wounded,
deserting, and committing suicide.

132
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:22,741
You've been bullying them
to their suicides, Warabihime.

133
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,622
What a terrible thing to say, mistress.

134
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,584
Do you not trust me?

135
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:37,548
Don't you think that they're at fault
for getting on my nerves?

136
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,803
I've turned a blind eye so far.

137
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,182
But you've gone too far.

138
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,184
I can't cover for you anymore.

139
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,855
Who do you think

140
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:58,360
made this brothel so famous, old hag?

141
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:05,326
A long time ago, when I was still a child,

142
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,954
<i>I heard this
from an old lady at a teahouse.</i>

143
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:14,543
<i>She was senile, but she told me
a story about a certain Oiran.</i>

144
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:20,007
<i>She was very beautiful, yet very cruel.</i>

145
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,305
<i>She said she saw that Oiran
in her youth and middle ages.</i>

146
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:31,310
<i>The Oiran appended "hime" to her name,
which means "princess."</i>

147
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,647
<i>When she got irritated,</i>

148
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:41,695
she had a peculiar habit of tilting
her head and staring down at you.

149
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,241
What the hell are you?

150
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,493
You…

151
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:52,122
{\an8}You're not human, aren't you?

152
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,050
{\an8}Don't you know?

153
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:09,807
Silence is golden.
It's wise to just stay quiet.

154
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,310
That's how the rest
have managed to stay alive.

155
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,400
I suppose you are much

156
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:24,029
stupider than I thought.

157
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,825
Too bad, Omitsu.

158
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,122
Don't be so frightened.

159
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,209
An old body like yours doesn't taste good.

160
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:43,215
I'm not going to eat something
so hideous and filthy.

161
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,926
{\an8}Farewell, Omitsu.

162
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,219
{\an8}No…

163
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,304
Stop!

164
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,314
-What happened?
-What was that sound?

165
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,857
No way!

166
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,068
-She fell!
-Someone, help!

167
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,862
Isn't that the mistress?

168
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,365
Someone, please call the master now!

169
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,581
How are you doing?

170
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,334
Lord Muzan!

171
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,963
You seem to have consumed a lot of humans.

172
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,383
You've become much stronger than before.

173
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,886
That's a good thing.

174
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,846
Yes!

175
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,849
{\an8}However, don't let your guard down.

176
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,228
{\an8}You might slip when things go too well.

177
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,648
{\an8}I'm grateful for your advice.

178
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,859
{\an8}There are skilled hunters
in the Demon Slayer Corps,

179
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,656
{\an8}such as the Hashiras,
who can sense demons right away.

180
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:53,744
{\an8}But unless they're as skilled as Hashiras,

181
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:58,457
{\an8}they mostly can't tell the difference
because we look like humans.

182
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,544
{\an8}However, they can discern things
humans don't understand,

183
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,298
{\an8}such as blood types, diseases, and genes.

184
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,386
Daki.

185
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,513
Yes!

186
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,932
What is it, Lord Muzan?

187
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,519
I have high hopes for you.

188
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,899
{\an8}You're more beautiful
and stronger than anyone else.

189
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,695
{\an8}Strong enough
to have eliminated seven Hashiras.

190
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,281
From now on, too,

191
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:36,745
you will become
much more powerful and cruel.

192
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,957
You're a special demon.

193
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,972
Don't you dare touch me so casually!

194
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,976
You rotten little brat.

195
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,229
Looks like you need to be taught a lesson.

196
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,982
A tough one.

197
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,484
Warabihime Oiran.

198
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,405
I beg of you.

199
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,159
Please stop this commotion.

200
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,912
The brothel is opening soon,
and clients are coming.

201
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,457
I'll hand out her punishment personally.

202
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,083
So I'm begging you.

203
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,212
Please help me save face.

204
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,848
{\an8}It seems I'm being too rough
on the newcomer.

205
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,601
Please treat her wounds.

206
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,605
Raise your head, Master.

207
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,399
I would like to apologize as well.

208
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,987
I've been feeling a bit annoyed lately.

209
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,867
I'll get ready for my job,
so clean this mess up.

210
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,619
Yes.

211
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,580
Call the others! Clean this up now!

212
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,834
Don't upset Warabihime Oiran!

213
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,963
<i>That brat…</i>

214
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,802
<i>There's no doubt
she got minor injuries from that hit.</i>

215
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,721
<i>She might have fainted, but…</i>

216
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,266
{\an8}<i>She managed to minimize
the damage against her.</i>

217
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,727
<i>She's no ordinary person.</i>

218
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,522
<i>I bet she's a member of the Corps.</i>

219
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,526
<i>But she's not as capable as a Hashira.</i>

220
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,585
It took some time,
but they're finally here.

221
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,255
Keep coming.

222
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:56,093
<i>I'll kill all of you
and have myself a feast.</i>

223
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,898
<i>Darkness lingers in the air.</i>

224
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>The night in this town…</i>

225
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,489
<i>smells saturated with darkness.</i>

226
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,169
Zenko.

227
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,837
-Zenko!
-Zenko!

228
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,469
Thank goodness.

229
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,596
Are you okay, Zenko?

230
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,894
What happened to me?

231
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:15,190
You were hit and you fainted.

232
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,861
Oh, right, I'm Zenko.

233
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,240
I was just dreaming of turning
into a man before.

234
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,493
We brought you some food. Please eat up.

235
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,454
Cool your cheek with this.

236
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,207
It hurts.

237
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,001
Are you okay?

238
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,255
Yes, it's not as bad as it looks. I guess.

239
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,550
-Thank you, Zenko.
-What?

240
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,469
You're hurt because of me.

241
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:51,226
{\an8}It's a man's duty to help a crying maiden.

242
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,730
But I'm not a man! I mean as a person!

243
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,523
The eldest daughter, for example!

244
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:01,528
I'm the eldest daughter!
I can't leave the younger ones crying!

245
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,488
That's not true.

246
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:08,076
Everyone here is too occupied
with their own work.

247
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,497
I've never met anyone as kind as you.

248
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,419
See you, Zenko.

249
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,837
Take care.

250
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,672
Have a good rest.

251
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,258
Yes. Thank you.

252
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,526
{\an8}<i>Junior and senior high school.</i>

253
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,404
{\an8}<i>Tales of</i> Kimetsu <i>Academy:
Christmas Edition.</i>

254
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,284
Today is Christmas,
the day I've been waiting for.

255
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,162
{\an8}I've invited Nezuko
to the Christmas party,

256
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:56,416
and I've prepared everything needed
for our ceremony.

257
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,045
{\an8}Oh, that must be Nezuko!

258
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,756
{\an8}Welcome. I've been waiting for you--

259
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,258
{\an8}Thank you for inviting us!

260
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,760
{\an8}We're here.

261
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,516
What's a Christmas? Tell me!

262
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,392
I didn't invite you guys!

263
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,936
What with those outfits?

264
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,271
{\an8}There are too many problems with you guys!

265
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,982
You never got invited
to a Christmas party, right?

266
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,902
I don't need anyone
other than Nezuko! Go home!

267
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,945
What?

268
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,531
You better tell me
what this "Christmas" thing is!

269
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,615
Shut up! You want to go?

270
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,242
