1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,772
Hinatsuru!

2
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,919
I'm sorry, Lord Tengen.

3
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,797
It's okay. Just stop talking.

4
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,219
I realized that
Warabihime Oiran is a demon,

5
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,556
but she was suspicious of me, too.

6
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,561
<i>I drank some poison,
so I could get out of the brothel.</i>

7
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>However, Warabihime Oiran gave me this obi</i>

8
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:33,319
<i>to observe and kill me
if something happens.</i>

9
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,780
<i>That's why I couldn't contact you.</i>

10
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:42,829
Lord Tengen, don't mind me, just go.

11
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,624
You must have heard the sound a while ago.

12
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,836
The demon is going on a rampage.

13
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,048
Are you sure you're okay?

14
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,634
Yes.

15
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,054
I'm very sorry for not being of any use.

16
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,058
You don't have to do anything anymore.

17
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,606
{\an8}Once the antidote takes effect,
get out of Yoshiwara.

18
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,816
{\an8}Do you understand?

19
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,239
Yes.

20
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,038
<i>The battle has begun.</i>

21
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,748
<i>Where is it?</i>

22
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,583
<i>Search for their presence.</i>

23
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,467
It's here. Underground.

24
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,095
<i>I hear the sound of fighting.</i>

25
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,058
<i>The reverberations sound very clear.</i>

26
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,103
<i>There's something in here.</i>

27
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,483
Sound Breathing,

28
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,194
First Form: Roar!

29
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,656
UPPER RANK SIX

30
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
Those bugs are noisy.

31
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,286
What was that sound? What are they doing?

32
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,496
Where is it coming from?

33
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,581
Ogimoto House, huh?

34
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,042
And Hinatsuru has escaped?

35
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,380
How many of you came here? Four hunters?

36
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,965
I won't tell.

37
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,719
If you tell me the truth,
I will let you live.

38
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,056
We just clashed a little,

39
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,227
and your sword is already chipped.

40
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,566
Whoever forged that sword
must be a crappy swordsmith.

41
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,484
You're wrong!

42
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,695
The one who forged this
is an amazing person!

43
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,989
He's a skilled swordsmith!

44
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,659
Then why is it chipped, you fool?

45
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,622
You're beginning to rattle
all over the place.

46
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,711
Since you pissed me off,
I'll kill you with my next blow.

47
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>It's chipped because of its user.</i>

48
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>It's my fault.</i>

49
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,385
<i>I…</i>

50
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,262
<i>As I thought, I…</i>

51
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,892
<i>I really can't master Water Breathing.</i>

52
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,732
<i>I'm not suited to be
a Water Breathing user.</i>

53
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,487
<i>The users must be like
Sir Urokodaki or Tomioka.</i>

54
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,948
<i>In my case,</i>

55
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,994
<i>Hinokami Kagura is inevitably stronger
in terms of powerful strikes.</i>

56
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,955
<i>It's compatible with my body.</i>

57
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,333
<i>But…</i>

58
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,175
Take it easy, you idiot!

59
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,180
That won't make this a training!

60
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,222
Hinokami Kagura:

61
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,684
Dance!

62
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,020
Clear Blue--

63
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,983
Tanjiro!

64
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,611
Are you hurt, Tanjiro?

65
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,779
Are you hungry?

66
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,238
Stupid!

67
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,324
-You stupid boar!
<i>-It was so powerful that…</i>

68
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,161
{\an8}<i>-I couldn't use it consecutively.</i>
-Hold on! I'll call Shinobu.

69
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,333
<i>It's different now.
I should be able to do it.</i>

70
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,503
{\an8}<i>No.</i> <i>I have to do it!</i>

71
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,881
<i>That's why I've trained.</i>

72
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,132
<i>Don't lose.</i>

73
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,425
<i>Ablaze…</i>

74
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,969
<i>Be ablaze. Set it ablaze.</i>

75
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,222
<i>Set your heart ablaze!</i>

76
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,975
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

77
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,687
<i>Raging Sun!</i>

78
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,149
<i>He changed his style.</i>

79
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,360
<i>It's sharper than before.</i>

80
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,656
What is this sound?

81
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,407
What an unpleasant sound.

82
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,784
Breathing sound?

83
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,703
<i>Flame Dance!</i>

84
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,373
{\an8}<i>Flame Dance is a two-strike combo.</i>

85
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,291
{\an8}<i>If she dodged,
I still have the second strike.</i>

86
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,252
<i>This is nothing.</i>

87
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,294
<i>Is this…</i>

88
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,462
all you've got?

89
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,050
Where is he?

90
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,638
Hinokami Kagura: Fake Rainbow.

91
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,810
<i>It's an opening! An opening thread!</i>

92
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,228
I can do this!

93
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,398
Hinokami Kagura: Fire Wheel!

94
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,028
{\an8}You're so slow, I even have time to yawn.

95
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,741
<i>Take a safe landing!</i>

96
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,993
<i>Safe landing…</i>

97
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,215
<i>It's the repercussions of doing
Hinokami Kagura techniques in a row.</i>

98
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>My muscles are stiff
from the built-up fatigue.</i>

99
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,014
So you're still alive.

100
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,018
<i>Calm down. I need to take a steady breath.</i>

101
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,145
<i>Recover!</i>

102
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,147
<i>Hurry!</i>

103
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,815
<i>Do a recovery breathing!</i>

104
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,329
<i>Her obi is like a tough blade.</i>

105
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,916
<i>Even though I see the opening threads,
they immediately break.</i>

106
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,710
<i>My attacks are too slow.</i>

107
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,254
<i>Raise the temperature!</i>

108
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,090
{\an8}<i>Raise the temperature more!</i>

109
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:34,222
I'll tell Miss Shinobu
that your fever isn't going down.

110
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,559
Kiyo, I beg you. Please keep it a secret.

111
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,311
I'll be fine.

112
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,979
But…

113
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,523
{\an8}I'm healthy.

114
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,108
I'm fine. I'm totally okay.

115
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,736
Look at this thermometer.

116
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,738
It's 38 degrees.

117
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,574
It's the same as yesterday
and the day before it.

118
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,743
It hasn't changed this whole time.

119
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:03,125
The fact that you continue
to have this fever is abnormal.

120
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,214
I don't know what to do myself.

121
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,383
It has to be Miss Shinobu.

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,222
To be honest,

123
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,601
I'm actually fine when I have this fever.

124
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,396
{\an8}With this, I can use
Hinokami Kagura techniques consecutively.

125
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,982
I might get even stronger.

126
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,987
Could you please hold off
on telling Shinobu a little longer?

127
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,781
Please, just a little longer.

128
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,995
I understand.

129
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,415
But just a little longer.

130
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,132
<i>I can feel my body temperature rising.</i>

131
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,052
<i>I can fight an Upper Rank demon.</i>

132
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,265
<i>He's more persistent than I thought.</i>

133
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,142
<i>This is interesting.</i>

134
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,768
<i>I can do it!</i>

135
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,271
<i>Hinokami Kagura is working against her.</i>

136
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,150
<i>No. It's not enough.</i>

137
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,360
<i>I have to win!</i>

138
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,113
<i>I have to use all my strength</i>

139
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,865
<i>and win for sure!</i>

140
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,451
<i>To protect someone.</i>

141
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,412
<i>To protect lives.</i>

142
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,208
<i>I won't let unjust fate rob something
from me ever again.</i>

143
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,754
<i>I won't let anyone…</i>

144
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,716
{\an8}<i>go through the same sadness as we did.</i>

145
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,310
The uglies are always ugly,
no matter how hard they try.

146
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,732
A LITTLE WHILE AGO
BACK AT THE OGIMOTO HOUSE

147
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,443
What happened?

148
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,070
Monster!

149
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,071
There's a monster!

150
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,157
Just do your work.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,703
A boar monster is breaking
the ceiling and the floor!

152
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,207
-What?
-There's no such thing.

153
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,833
Then come--

154
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,763
This demon presence makes me tingle.

155
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,433
Here it is.

156
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,022
I found it!

157
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,483
I found the hole leading
to the demon's lair!

158
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,735
Brace yourself!

159
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,117
Only my head can get in.

160
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,328
{\an8}How naive.

161
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,331
{\an8}Nothing can withstand the Great Inosuke.

162
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,086
I'm the man who can dislodge
every joint in his body.

163
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,675
In other words, I can go anywhere
as long as my head can get in.

164
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:05,224
Pig assault! Nobody can stop me.

165
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,813
This is so far deep.
This isn't an animal trail.

166
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,481
It must be a demon.

167
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,109
{\an8}There's a demon in here!

168
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,868
What is this place?

169
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,174
<i>A human-patterned cloth?</i>

170
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,177
<i>What's with all of this?</i>

171
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,221
<i>No. This sensation…</i>

172
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>These are living humans.</i>

173
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:51,061
<i>So the demon trapped humans
within a woman's bellyband.</i>

174
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,903
<i>Then it can eat them whenever it likes.</i>

175
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,989
<i>What a vore.</i>

176
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,245
What's this guy doing here?

177
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,290
And what are you doing here?

178
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,793
You've entered my food storehouse.

179
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,545
Dirty.

180
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,547
So dirty.

181
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,134
You are dirty, stinky little shit!

182
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,137
What's with this worm? It's so creepy!

183
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,140
You little shit!

184
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,312
{\an8}Keep squirming all over the place!

185
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,232
You're creeping me out, damned obi worm!

186
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,277
Your movement is so slow!

187
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,072
Looks like you got greedy
and captured too many humans.

188
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,116
Some attacks of a big, fat worm…

189
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,703
are not going to hit the Great Inosuke!

190
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,165
Get your ass up and come at me again!

191
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,713
{\an8}<i>He's cautiously avoiding the humans
when he cuts.</i>

192
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,884
<i>Though I went to the trouble
of preserving such fresh food…</i>

193
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>His instincts are sharp.</i>

194
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,307
{\an8}<i>Especially his ability
to feel bloodlust is abnormal.</i>

195
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,477
<i>No matter which direction I attack from,</i>

196
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,729
<i>he can sense and evade them.</i>

197
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,985
<i>I never expected a demon hunter
to enter my food storehouse.</i>

198
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,820
<i>What should I do?</i>

199
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,739
<i>Capture him alive.</i>

200
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,491
UPPER RANK

201
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:32,079
<i>That's the guy who got in
when you captured Makio.</i>

202
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,956
<i>He was beautiful.</i>

203
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:40,337
<i>You can kill all the preserved humans
except the ten prettiest ones.</i>

204
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,967
<i>Although it may be harder to catch him
alive rather than to just kill him.</i>

205
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,847
{\an8}<i>Eat some humans there
and strengthen your own power.</i>

206
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,892
{\an8}Take this!

207
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,396
<i>I can't cut it?
Is it because of its wriggling?</i>

208
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,782
{\an8}Beast Breathing, Sixth Fang:

209
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,452
Palisade Bite!

210
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,706
{\an8}There's no point in cutting me.
I'm not the main body after all.

211
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:21,962
But more importantly, are you sure
it's okay to neglect the girls you saved?

212
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,677
I can regain the strength I lost
from getting hit by you in no time.

213
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,768
<i>Crap! I have to fight
while protecting people!</i>

214
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,145
Shit! I won't make it!

215
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,438
You damned obi worm!

216
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,028
Calling it "obi worm"
is a good way of putting it!

217
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,863
That thing is really disgusting!

218
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,740
You're right!

219
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,076
I'm going to tell Lord Tengen!

220
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,121
We'll back you up,

221
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,415
so good luck there, Boar Head!

222
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,418
Who the hell are you?

223
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,712
We're Uzui's wives!

224
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,465
Since I can't fight very well…

225
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,259
don't expect too much from me!

226
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,514
Suma, don't be a wimp!

227
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,307
But…

228
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,769
You know that
I'm a worthless loser, right?

229
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,853
I got captured right away.

230
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,899
I can't protect all these captured people!

231
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,110
I'm probably going to die first!

232
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,571
That's right. You get it.

233
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,616
{\an8}Who should I eat first?

234
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,953
<i>That bastard is not the main body?</i>

235
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,913
<i>If that's true, this is bad.</i>

236
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,332
<i>This fight is never going to end.</i>

237
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,209
Thunder Breathing,

238
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,919
First Form:

239
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,881
Thunderclap and Flash, Sixfold.

240
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,691
You'd better be sleeping forever, man.

241
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,319
THEY CARRIED ZENITSU'S SWORD

242
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,238
Is that kid a Corps member, too?

243
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,574
Why is that kid dressed so ridiculously?

244
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,409
{\an8}I have no idea!

245
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,995
-Hey, come on!
<i>-What's with that guy?</i>

246
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,788
-Get ready, man!
<i>-That was so quick.</i>

247
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,915
<i>But more importantly,</i>

248
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,668
<i>were there two noises just now?</i>

249
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,630
<i>There were two thunder-like sounds.</i>

250
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,466
<i>One was from this guy.</i>

251
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,719
And one more was from above!

252
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,522
<i>Wind is blowing? Was a tunnel opened up?</i>

253
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:50,194
<i>How did someone manage to dig a hole
from above ground?</i>

254
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,029
What was that?

255
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,740
<i>There's someone.</i>

256
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,744
<i>Someone's entering this place.</i>

257
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,291
{\an8}DESTROYER OF DEMONS

258
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,255
{\an8}<i>This presence…</i>

259
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,091
<i>is of a Hashira!</i>

260
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,774
Lord Tengen…

261
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,236
SLAYER

262
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,571
Makio. Suma.

263
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,907
Sorry for being late.

264
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,328
I'm relieved you two are safe.

265
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,503
<i>It wasn't like this before.</i>

266
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:55,259
<i>We didn't mind dying
because that's what we were taught.</i>

267
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,636
<i>Because we're ninjas.</i>

268
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,430
<i>Especially the kunoichi,</i>

269
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,059
<i>who is inferior to a male ninja
in terms of strength.</i>

270
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,897
<i>Putting our lives on the line
was the least we could do.</i>

271
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,405
You must only think about your own lives.

272
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,160
Whatever else you leave behind,
you must come back to my place first.

273
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,954
Your lives are more important
than a mission.

274
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,875
I know that what I'm saying
doesn't make sense in this line of work.

275
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,459
But I'll allow it.

276
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,964
I'll decide a clear,
flamboyant life priority.

277
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,969
First, you three.

278
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,221
Then, respectable people.

279
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,140
Lastly, myself.

280
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,101
As demon hunters,

281
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,063
we naturally protect the ordinary people
who are living a plain life.

282
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,401
But frankly, you are precious to me.

283
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,861
So don't die.

284
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,239
<i>Is it okay to say that?</i>

285
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:04,620
<i>If we put our lives on priority,
we can't do our jobs properly.</i>

286
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,121
<i>Is it really okay?</i>

287
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,124
Why not?

288
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,045
Lord Tengen said he's okay with it.

289
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:20,052
Not wanting to die
and choosing to live aren't bad.

290
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,224
As long as you don't mind,
that's all that matters.

291
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,892
I'm sure of it.

292
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,940
You're right.

293
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,001
Looks like you did
some flamboyant work here.

294
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,048
I expect nothing less from my wives.

295
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,932
All right!

296
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,069
From now on,
things are going to get really flamboyant!

297
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,079
<i>-Nin-nin!
-Nin-nin!</i>

298
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,624
I can't believe that
Sound Hashira has three wives.

299
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,709
Why don't you go for it too, Zenitsu?

300
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,919
What? Can I?

301
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:03,465
-Maybe I'll go for Yoshiko, Sanae, and--
-I'm telling Nezuko.

302
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,966
Tanjiro!

303
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,594
It's time for the Taisho-era secret.

304
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,347
Uzui's family is polygamous.

305
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,393
When you turn 15, the head of the family
chooses 3 wives based on compatibility.

306
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,106
But I've heard
that Suma volunteered herself.

307
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,358
Maybe I'll become a ninja too.

308
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,902
Then you'll be training to be
a ninja starting today.

309
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,820
What?

310
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,613
No!

311
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,074
Next, episode 6, "Overlapping Memories."

312
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,158
TO BE CONTINUED
