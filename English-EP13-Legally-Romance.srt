(Vocational Skills Competition)
Um, Professor Zhang.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,920
I object.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,110
I'm at a disadvantage.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,920
Why should I pursue Lu Xun?

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,470
Why can't he be the one
who pursues me?

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:11,920
Plus,

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,800
I don't think

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,070
it's an appropriate topic for

10
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,880
the final.

11
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,390
Debater Qian Wei.

12
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,070
I suggest you be careful
with your words.

13
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,920
Professor Zhang

14
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,040
(Final)
chose the topic.

15
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,710
It has got depth.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,390
Let us begin.

17
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,560
I go first, right?

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,950
I think you should accept her.

19
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,910
A girl who studies the law?

20
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,150
She must be smart.

21
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,110
She can memorize

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,110
hundreds of articles of law.

23
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,430
She'd be sensible as a girlfriend,

24
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,110
and you two would have
a high-intelligence child.

25
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,880
So of course,

26
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,950
you choose a girl who studies the law.

27
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,240
Debater Qian Wei, attention, please.

(2011 Law School)
This is scenario simulation.

29
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,590
(Vocational Skills Competition)
Please get into the character.

30
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,470
A girlfriend with a good memory?

31
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,430
What if we get into a fight?

32
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,430
She'll bring up the past.

33
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,790
Who can handle that?

34
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,270
Look.

35
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,880
Here's the thing.

36
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,150
When you have a fight

37
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,040
with an ordinary girl,

38
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,120
and if you win,

39
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,680
you'll get beaten.

40
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,040
If you lose, you'll get an earful.

41
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
But if you date a law school girl,

42
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,590
things will be different.

43
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,550
We value fairness.

44
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,760
We're easy to get along with.

45
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,950
You can think about it.

46
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,000
We've been in an argument

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,400
for three hours.

48
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,230
Don't you feel tired?

49
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,400
Maybe you don't,

50
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
but I do.

51
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,550
A girlfriend who studies law

52
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,230
is essential for a family.

53
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,950
If you need to appeal to the court

54
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,480
or defend your rights,

55
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,160
you can just

56
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,360
put me in front.

57
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,400
You tried

58
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
to transfer
my marital property just now.

59
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,720
That's like unnecessary

60
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,440
trouble for myself.

61
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:28,870
No.

62
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,630
We are both

63
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,800
law school students,

64
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,270
so we share many topics.

65
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,000
We

66
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,830
have the same kind of resources

67
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,950
that we can share internally.

68
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,440
Okay?

69
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Having a relationship
isn't like running a company.

70
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,400
Why must I date someone
in the same line of work?

71
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,270
How about this?

72
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,830
If I do need an assistant someday,

73
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,000
you'll be the first one

74
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,950
to receive my phone call.

75
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,870
You can be my assistant,

76
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,720
and problem's solved.

77
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,270

Fine, fine.

84
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,440
I lose this one.

85
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,160
What?

86
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,600

87

that I might shed blood today.

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,670
Eat this.

193
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,390
I'm 28 years old.

194
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,270
Keep calm. Keep calm.

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,440
Little brother,

196
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,950
let me teach you something.

197
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,640
Sometimes,

198
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,440
two things

199
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,830
aren't meant to be together.

200
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,880
If you force

201
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,350
them to be together,

202
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,640
there will be a problem.

203
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,350
For example.

204
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:46,880
Look,

205
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,950
you

206
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,270
are coke,

207
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,950
and I

208
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,670
am peppermint candy.

209
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,600
You drop the candy into the coke.

210
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
Look. Immediately,

211
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,640
there's a problem.

212
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,270
Look.

213
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,760
Do you see it?

214
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,640
See the reaction?

215
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,950
Where did you learn

216
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,600
that I like

217
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
to drink mint-flavored coke?

218
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Oh, right.

219
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
What did you say previously?

220
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,760
What would you do

221
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
if you saw fizz on the mouth?

222
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,230
I'll rush the dishes.

223
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,510
I'll go check if the dishes are ready.

224
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
I didn't get to eat the free food.

225
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,270
I'll have to grab some food at school.

226
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,390
Are you going to catch some seafood?

227
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,830
They told me they were out

228
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,760
of soybean sauce.

229
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,110
I'm going to buy a bottle.

230
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,160
Forget about the soybean sauce.

231
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,440
Tell me

232
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,920
the answer to the love letter.

233
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,270
What love letter?

234
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,390
There's no love letter.

235
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,510
Is this a love letter?

236
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,200
Is he mocking you

237
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,070
as a silly bird?

238
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,320
A sparrow behind the silly bird, huh?

239
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,950
I tell you what,

240
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,830
I don't care what bird you are,

241
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,230
whether you be sparrow

242
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,110
or vulture,

243
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,600
I'll just

244
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,760
pluck every feather from you.

245
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,550
Seriously?

246
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,510
Who writes a love letter nowadays?

247
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,670
You wrote it?

248
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,200
I mean.

249
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,320
O... Or

250
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,000
what do you think it is?

251
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,790
Here's the deal, little brother.

252
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,390
You're

253
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,320
young and impetuous.

254
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,640
You'll easily stray.

255
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,920
But Mo Zixin

256
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,950
is your one and only true love.

257
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,440
Get it?

258
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,880
I never

259
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,350
liked Mo Zixin.

260
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,350
Hold up.

261
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,550
You need

262
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,030
to be careful with your words.

263
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,080
You changed your QQ nickname,

264
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
and you asked about her application.

265
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
You did all these

266
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,150
for Zixin, didn't you?

267
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,910
And at the party,

268
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,440
I asked you,

269
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,200
"What do you want the most?"

270
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,590
Your answer was Zixin.

271
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,110
What I meant

272
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,840
was the star in the sky.

273
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,710
But I was right

274
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,520
about the concert ticket

275
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
ten years afterwards, huh?

276
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,080
I tell you what.

277
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,910
I understand how you feel.

278
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,550
You can't just move

279
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,640
your love

280
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,110
after you got rejected

281
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,550
by Zixin.

282
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,440
Even if you do,

283
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
don't move your love on to me.

284
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,670
Do you understand?

285
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,710
This is exaction.

286
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,400
I bought

287
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,550
the ticket for you.

288
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,640
Mo Zixin bought two tickets,

289
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,200
and she wanted

290
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,960
to go to the concert with me,

291
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,030
but I turned her down.

292
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,550
I didn't give you the ticket

293
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,200
and ask you out

294
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,840
because...

295
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,230
I was worried that Li Chongwen
was the one you liked.

296
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,880
Since it's a misunderstanding,

297
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,640
we downplay it,

298
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,670
and then forget about it.

299
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,840
Not a chance.

300
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,080
You're unbelievable.

301
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,080
For all this time,

302
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm the one
who keeps a clear mind,

303
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,110
and you're the one
who got it all wrong.

304
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,790
All of your evidence

305
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,150
and appeal

306
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,710
are overruled by me.

307
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
From today on,

308
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
you'll be my girlfriend.

309
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,200
Okay?

310
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,670
Wait a minute.

311
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,150
Your verdict is invalid.

312
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,640
It was all problematic.

313
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
There was nothing
but misunderstandings.

314
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
You have to bind us together,

315
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,840
and that's not right.

316
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,230
We're not meant for each other.

317
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,110
Do you understand?

318
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,030
I tell you what.

319
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,840
Look,

320
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
I eat spicy food,

321
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,550
but you don't.

322
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,200
I like eating garlic,

323
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,080
but you don't.

324
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
I love animals,

325
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,760
for example, puppies…

326
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,000
Whatever you like,

327
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,320
I can make compromises

328
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,910
for you.

329
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,640
Okay.

330
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,110
Let's bring it to the spiritual level.

331
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,470
Right?

332
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,670
Look at me.

333
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,910
I… I…

334
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,910
I'm a cheap girl.

335
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,640
And you?

336
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,030
You're

337
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,030
decent

338
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,470
and upright.

339
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,670
And me?

340
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm a slave to money.

341
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
While you take wealth and fame lightly.

342
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,030
We aren't suitable for each other.

343
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,960
I,

344
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,790
Lu Xun, will give you

345
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,150
all the money that I currently have

346
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,710
and will earn.

347
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,440
Not a single penny for myself.

348
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,760
All right.

349
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,230
Stop babbling

350
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,230
with me.

351
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,200
You're now

352
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,080
avoiding the most

353
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,910
crucial question.

354
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,590
Can you answer it?

355
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,760
What question?

356
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
Do you like me or not?

357
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,110
Come on.

358
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,910
Like I would dare.

359
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,150
Having a relationship with the boss

360
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,590
would be a curse.

361
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,710
What boss?

362
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,080
Who's the boss?

363
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,880
We'll both be bosses.

364
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,440
You'll be a boss-man,

365
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,080
and I'll be a boss-woman.

366
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,840
Two bosses

367
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,880
cannot have a relationship.

368
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,590
In a word,

369
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,470
you're too good for me.

370
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm off.

371
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,030
Do you

372
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,880
like me or not?

373
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,230
Come on.

374
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,470
I... I told you.

375
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,400
I never

376
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,910
thought about it.

377
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,200
Listen.

378
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,230
Listen to me.

379
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,230
I swear to you,

380
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,110
if I

381
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,400
ever had

382
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,960
the thought in my mind,

383
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,520
I will…

384
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,350
You will be my assistant forever.

385
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,110
No.

386
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,150
Then you do like me.

387
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,080
If I ever

388
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,910
had the thought in my mind,

389
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,230
from now on,

390
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,080
all my photos on my certificates

391
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,080
will look like a disaster.

392
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,150
What are you doing?

393
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,230
Who allowed you to touch my stuff?

394
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,700
(Name: Qian Wei School: School of Law)

395
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,320
It looks like
you're in deep love with me.

396
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,400
W... What…?

397
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,440
What is wrong with you?

398
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,150
Watch your mouth.

399
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,440
My photo looks good.

400
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,590
Listen up, Qian Wei.

401
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,440
From the very beginning,

402
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
you've been the one I like.

403
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,200
I know this sounds

404
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,590
like a big misunderstanding to you.

405
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,670
But it's okay.

406
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,910
Because to me,

407
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,880
my love for you is the force majeure.

408
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,520
Let there be

409
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,710
no rivalry between us anymore.

410
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,880
Because

411
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,350
you will always win.

412
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,710
The peppermint

413
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,590
has been dropped into my heart.

414
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,200
I think you should take responsibility.

415
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,660
(Peppermint Candy)

416
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
It is in my heart.

417
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,880
But I don't know

418
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,960
about me myself yet.

419
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,000
To this problem,

420
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,640
there is one

421
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,440
excellent solution.

422
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,230
The solution

423
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,320
is

424
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,000
that we

425
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,110
kiss.

426
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,230
Then we will…

427
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,520
We will find out

428
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,910
the answer we want.

429
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,760
Do you know that?

430
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,670
What?

431
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,670
Not a chance.

432
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,440
Pick another day.

433
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,200
See you around.

434
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,230
(The whole thing
has gone out of control.)

435
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,590
(Lu Xun is supposed)

436
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,550
(to be with Mo Zixin)

437
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,520
(right now.)

438
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,350
(I just helped put them together.)

439
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,280
(I didn't mean to modify the script.)

440
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,440
(What's next?)

441
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,660
(Haunted House Ticket)

442
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,460
(Social Work Record)

443
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,300
(Social Work Record)

444
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,460
(2011 Debate Team Recruitment)

445
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,710
(I don't know when)

446
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,590
(I started to put things about him)

447
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,230
(under my pillow.)

448
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,760
(Do I have feelings for him?)

449
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,590
(I won the competition.)

450
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,760
(But I lost my heart.)

451
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,470
(Though he's a little brother,)

452
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,790
(he's still the same Lu Xun.)

453
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,760
(A cunning fellow.)

454
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,400
Are you ready?

455
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,200
Would you like a try?

456
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,710
(Lu Xun)
(Get downstairs to give me the answer.)

457
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,260
(Qian Wei)

458
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,000
(I said)

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,110
(tomorrow.)

460
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,760
(Lu Xun)
(It is tomorrow.)

461
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,880
(It's just past 12 o'clock.)

462
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,380
(Lu Xun)

463
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,880
(I'm waiting downstairs.)

464
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,910
(If you don't get downstairs,)

465
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,400
(I'll climb the windows.)

466
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,840
I'll keep practicing.

467
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,280
Have you been

468
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,550
waiting here the whole time?

469
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,790
Aren't you cold?

470
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,200
Never mind that.

471
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,880
So…

472
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,230
Have you thought about it?

473
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,110
Will we

474
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,550
kiss?

475
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,000
Just give it a go.

476
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,160
Hey, you two!

477
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,350
What are you doing out there

478
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,400
in the middle of the night?

479
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,470
We…

480
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,040
Uh…

481
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,470
We are talking about

482
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,520
advanced mathematics.

483
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,310
A... Advanced mathematics.

484
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:18,640
Yes. Yes.

485
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm into math.

486
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,680
I love math.

487
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,230
Go back to your dorms.

488
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:22,950
Okay. Got it.

489
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,470
Okay.

490
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,800
People are having fun over there.

491
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,000
Right over there.

492
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,430
Go back to your dorms.

493
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,950
Excuse me.

494
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,230
What the…?

495
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,110
You saw us.

496
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,430
"Excuse me"?

497
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,710
Why did she have to say it?

498
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,640
What's the point?

499
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,950
It's okay.

500
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,470
We can do this.

501
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,590
Come on.

502
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,400
Come on.

503
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,160
Yeah?

504
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,950
Put your lips on mine.

505
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,880
- Come on.
- Come on.

506
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:21,800
No.

507
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,800
Having a relationship with the boss

508
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
is really a curse.

509
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,920
I'm off. Bye.

510
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,590
Wait.

511
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,310
Wait.

512
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,710
I mean,

513
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,070
our kiss has

514
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,230
noting to do with the thunder.

515
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,280
Can you not back out?

516
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,800
We are…

517
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,880
I didn't back out.

518
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,710
I get to

519
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,680
recall it

520
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,190
within two minutes.

521
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,760
I tell you what.

522
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,470
I just saved

523
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,310
your life.

524
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,640
Listen,

525
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,560
this is God's will.

526
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,880
Let's calm down.

527
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,590
We'll talk about it later.

528
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,160
- Bye.
- No. No.

529
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,830
No.

530
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,230
A kiss.

531
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,350
Wait a minute.

532
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,280
What are you doing?

533
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,920
Get out of here.

534
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,070
If the dorm lady sees you,

535
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,920
you'll be over.

536
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,280
I never believe

537
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,040
God's will.

It was so-so.

548
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm the sister.

549
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,950
And a sister like me

550
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,040
has seen the world.

551
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,350
I can't be charmed

552
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,800

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you talking about?

555
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,430
I mean the candy.

556
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:26,880
And

557
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,520
what do you mean…?

558
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,800
What do you mean
by "seen the world"?

559
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,190
What do you…?

560
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,680
Are...? Are you experienced?

561
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,800
Did...? Did you kiss

562
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,680

(Outpatient)

569
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,800
My mother told me this.

570
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
Although your dad

571
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,190
can be discharged from the hospital,

572
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,310
he still

573
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,590
needs to come back for reexaminations

574
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,710
on a regular basis.

575
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,680
You didn't tell your mom

576
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,640
about us, did you?

577
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,280
It's just I'm a man

578
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,160
of honesty.

579
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,520
You're ridiculous.

580
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,280
You could've chosen
to seal your lips.

581
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,520
My point is,

582
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,040
I think

583
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,430
my dad

584
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,880
just had the surgery,

585
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,110
and he can't take shocking news.

586
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,640
Also,

587
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,160
people say

588
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,710
showing off brings a quicker end.

589
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,590
It is optimal

590
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,560
that we hunker down,

591
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,000
that we lay low.

592
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,640
Hunker down?

593
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,070
Hunker down to do what?

594
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,760
What are you doing?

595
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,520
People can see us.

596
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,520
So how about

597
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,430
you do this?

598
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,590
You call me boss.

599
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,710
The last you called me boss,

600
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,590
and it felt quite nice.

601
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,760
It sounded pleasant.

602
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,800
Okay. Okay.

603
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,880
Boss. Boss. Boss.

604
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,800
I can do this.

605
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,470
Leave it to me.

606
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,880
I'm okay.

607
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,110
You're almost done?

608
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,070
Mr. Qian.

609
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,760
Stop.

610
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,280
Sit down.

611
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,760
Get some rest.

612
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,110
I'll do it.

613
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,520
It's fine.

614
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,160
How can you

615
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,800
do it personally?

616
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,160
Right?

617
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,070
And Mr. Qian, look.

618
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,110
This is a healthy diet

619
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,230
month card

620
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,830
that I applied for you.

621
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,430
They provide all the nutrient-rich food.

622
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,040
And

623
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,640
I have made an appointment
with my mom

624
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
about your next reexamination.

625
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,710
But later,

626
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,710
I'll double-check

627
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,070
if the date is okay for you.

628
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,710
Maybe we need to reschedule.

629
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,230
And then…

630
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,560
Uh, look.

631
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,680
Mr. Lu.

632
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
I am not disabled.

633
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,280
I can take care of my parents.

634
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,950
As an outsider,

635
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,950
you don't need to get yourself involved.

636
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,710
Okay?

637
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:47,920
Come on.

638
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,520
I am an outsider,

639
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,680
but I can show respect for…

640
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,280
Hey, you.

641
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,430
Why are you still eating?

642
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,400
Move the boxes.

643
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,920
Quickly.

644
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,190
So many boxes.

645
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,110
Do I move them all by myself?

646
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,230
Watch out for your hand.

647
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,800
Hey,

648
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,640
why are you looking at me?

649
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,520
Your sister doesn't allow

650
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,160
me, an outsider, to

651
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,350
get myself involved.

652
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,040
I thought you were smarter than that.

653
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,160
I was ready

654
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,070
to call you my brother-in-law.

655
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,800
Listen.

656
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,110
Let's go.

657
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,560
Hello.

658
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,400
The flowers for Fairy Qian.

659
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,280
Is it the right address?

660
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,950
Please sign and receive it.

661
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,560
Uh…

662
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,590
Lu didn't order this

663
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,920
with a special purpose.

664
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,160
He gives me this because

665
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,830
the debate team will have an activity,

666
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,110
right?

667
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,710
So he

668
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,040
gives me this in advance.

669
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,800
I didn't…

670
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Carry on.

671
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,800
Keep making things up.

672
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,950
I'm not.

673
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,280
(Silence)
Just a little surprise from him.

674
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,230
It doesn't even add up.

675
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,310
Still making things up.

676
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,920
I ordered it for your mother.

677
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,040
Give me that, please.

678
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,640
Thank you.

679
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,310
Thanks.

680
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,640
Look at you.

681
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,190
Full of lies.

682
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,760
Put it here.

683
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,110
It's just unnecessary.

684
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,190
When I'm out of the hospital,

685
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,680
(Fairy Qian)
let's take wedding dress pictures first.

686
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,000
Here.

687
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,350
I bet they cost a lot.

688
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,920
You silly.

689
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,760
I didn't know

690
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,160
your father could be romantic.

691
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,830
Diamonds last forever.

692
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,590
Two make me bankrupt.

693
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,000
Put it on.

694
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
Look at mine.

695
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,800
See that?

696
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,520
Two rings.

697
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,430
Double security.

698
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
Very much secured.

699
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,590
Don't touch me.
Get your hands off me.

700
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,680
Qian Yanping.

701
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,000
Please be quiet in the ward.

702
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,800
Why did you get

703
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,470
all these people here?

704
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry. Sorry.

705
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,310
Yeah. We're done here.

706
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,560
(I lost my campus card.)

707
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,560
(Qian Wei Fight against fate)
(Call me boss again.)

708
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,520
(I'll help you find it.)

709
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,760
(In your dreams.)

710
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
(I won't. Will you help me or not?)

711
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,920
She's quite stubborn.

712
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:48,950
Lu Xun.

713
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,110
Have you won a lottery

714
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,760
or are you in love?

715
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,680
You seem so happy.

716
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,350
I agreed to her

717
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,830
that I wouldn't speak.

718
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,640
I need to lay low.

719
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,640
Good for you.

720
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,660
(Qian Wei)

721
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,430
Then you're in a relationship.

722
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
The day before yesterday,

723
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,040
I saw an article on Renren.com.

724
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
It's perfect for you.

725
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,880
What article?

726
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll show you.

727
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,300
(Girls Will Be in Tears
If They Receive Them.)

728
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,800
Check it out.

729
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,580
(Knit a Pair of Gloves for Your Love.)

730
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,680
Knit a pair of gloves

731
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
for your love.

732
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,160
Childish.

733
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,230
It won't work.

734
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,920
Is it childish?

735
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,350
Look.

736
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,680
No dude would knit gloves for a girl.

737
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,230
Generally,

738
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,920
girls are thoughtful.

739
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
And a thoughtful girl

740
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,230
knits gloves for the guy.

741
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,640
Look at us…

742
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,310
Right?

743
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,830
Pretty good.

744
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,310
Wait a minute.

745
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,230
I have been

746
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,040
following the steps.

747
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,280
The video is doing perfectly,

748
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,070
but how come mine is…?

749
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,000
Hello.

750
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,640
(Captain Lu.)

751
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,560
(Too many people)

(Can you do the interviews?)

754
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm busy.

755
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Ask Captain Qian to do it.

756
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,590
(Fine.)

757
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,560
(Most people)

758
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
(sign up because of her anyway.)

759
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,000
(You have no idea)

760
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,040
(how wide-spread)

761
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,190

763
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,590
(has so many comments.)

764
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:20,950
Wait a minute.

765
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,160
I'll be in charge

766
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,230
of the interviews this year.

767
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,640
Don't bother Captain Qian.

768
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,810
(Raise your hand if you want to join
the debate team because of Qian Wei.)

769
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,920

Qian Wei.

777
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,070
Even Qian Chuan wouldn't

778
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,070
be stupid enough to leave

779
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,070
the campus card in the fridge.

780
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,280
Take it back.

781
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,230

782

I know I need to apply for a new card.

785
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,680
But it'll take at least a week.

786
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,110
Tell me,

787
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,310
how do I buy food

788
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,040

I've posted on Renren.com,

791
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,000
telling everybody that you

792
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,760
lost your card.

793
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,680

It looks like yours.

797
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,000
Come and look.

798
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,280
It was just found?

799
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,000
Is it yours?

800
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,000
Talk to him. Quickly.

801
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,000

00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,920

810
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,070
No reply.

811
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,350
I guess I won't get it back.

812
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,040
Maybe he's a pervert

813
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,640
who likes to collect

814
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,400
girls' items.

815
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,920
He finds things
and doesn't give them back.

816
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,950
Babe.

817
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,110
Remember my photo

820
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,640
Even I myself wouldn't want it.

821
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,400
Well, that's true.

822
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,520
Qian Wei,

823
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
the flowers are for you.

824
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,470
For me? I…

825
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,350
W...? What are you doing,

826
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,110
man?

827
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,430
Look.

828
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,400
You frequently

829
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,830
hang around the debate club

830
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,430
with the flowers in hand,

831
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,400
prying for information about Qian Wei.

832
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,040
Do you know

833
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,950
you're interfering with our work?

834
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,190
Can you please behave yourself?

835
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,400
You couldn't stop her at the door,

836
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,560
and now you're tailing her, huh?

837
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,470
What's the meaning of this?

838
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,920
See? You are wanted.

839
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,280
Actually, by two men at the same time.

840
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,590
I'm full.

841
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,590
You take your time.

842
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,350
Hey, listen.

843
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,830
The flowers are a token of his goodwill.

844
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,230
Why are you being so unfriendly?

845
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,560
What is this?

846
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,560
Sorry,

847
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,400
man.

848
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,070
He is a

849
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,430
hot-headed guy.

850
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,590

Oops.

875
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,310
Awkward.

876
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,920
I tell you what.

877
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,160
Jealousy is harmful

878
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,110
for the friendship

880
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,640
I wasn't jealous.

881
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,160
Are you enjoying the flowers?

882
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,400
Stop that.

883
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,830
I'm keeping you from

884
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,760
ineffective socializing.

885
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,350
You know?

886
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,520
Me being jealous?

887
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Yeah, he's a rapper.

888
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,000
He can rap at you.

889
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,520
Why did he rap at me?

890
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,400
And this?

891
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,160
It's fine. It's fine.

892
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
I'll buy you another one.

893
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,880
It's the university's property.

894
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:51,760
It's okay.

895
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,230
Calm down.

896
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,280
No need to be mad.

897
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,160
I don't like him.

898
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,350
I like you more.

899
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,160
Like me more?

900
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,760
Fine.

901
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,040
Here.

902
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,470
I'll give you a present.

903
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,040
We'll put them on in winter.

904
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,310
Wait.

905
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,880
What?

906
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,110
You knitted them?

907
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,230
Or who did?

908
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,590
Why did you knit these?

909
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,040
Just buy a pair.

910
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,710
Look at the color.

911
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,470
I mean,

912
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,640
it's greyish.

913
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:15,950
It's just…

914
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,950
Can you please not

915
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,070
judge a man's knitting skill?

916
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,590
This is how you wear them.

917
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,920
Put yours on.

918
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,520
Heat-insulating gloves?

919
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,590
Hand in hand.

920
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,110
Like this.

921
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,680
And what about this one?

922
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,830
It's called romance.

923
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,560
Do you understand romance?

924
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,520
Just a bit of romance.

925
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,070
What's the matter with that?

926
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,350
Fine, fine.

927
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,710
Are you so touched

928
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,040
that you're already tearful?

929
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,430
Why would I be tearful?

930
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,040
Because you knitted

931
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,880
a pair of stringed gloves

932
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,350
or because I lost my campus card?

933
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,230
About your campus card.

934
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,430
I can solve the problem for you.

935
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,800
But on one condition.

936
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,710
What is it?

937
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,760
If I find it,

938
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,190
you need to dine with me

939
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,000
for an entire month.

940
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
A whole month

941
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,880
is too long.

942
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,470
You know

943
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,190
I'm busy.

944
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,070
I've got Liu Shiyun

945
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,040
and Mo Zixin…

946
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,280
Qian Wei.

947
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,040
They…

948
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,430
A month is too long?

949
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,280
How about this?

950
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,230
You give me a kiss

951
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,430
or admit that we're dating,

952
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,350
and then we…

953
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,710
A month it is, then.

954
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,680
Let's dine together for one month.

955
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,560
Come on.

956
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,160
Put your hands back.

957
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,470
Fine.

958
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,070
Now that you've agreed.

959
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,430
Where did you find it?

960
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,040
(Guanghua University Library)
This is Qian Wei's

961
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,350
(Borrowing Record)
borrowing record of the month.

962
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,190
Thank you.

963
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,380
(Borrow Return)

964
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,420
(Name: Qian Wei School: School of Law)

965
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,310
I know it's your habit

966
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,000
(Name: Qian Wei School: School of Law)
that you put your card

967
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,110
between the pages as a bookmark,

968
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,520
so I went to the library.

969
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,040
And you said

970
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,160
the photo was disastrous on the card,

971
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,760
so I went to the administration office

972
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,950
to replace it.

973
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,350
This photo.

974
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,640
Look.

975
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,640
Like this.

976
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,640
Head portraits for lovers.

977
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,400
What do you think?

978
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,640
Isn't it

979
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,040
the profile photo

980
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,280
for the Students' Union
to select leaders?

981
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,000
How did the profile

982
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,430
pass the censorship
of the administration office?

983
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,560
Are you doubting

984
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,350
my ability

985
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,400
and charm?

986
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,760
(Jiang Taigong)
I figured you were Jiang Taigong.

987
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,470
Qian Wei.

988
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,560
This is a violation of privacy,

989
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,950
you know?

990
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,400
Your action is illegal appropriation,

991
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,070
you know?

992
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,590
You'd better explain yourself.

993
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,070
You know what?

994
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,230
After you won,

995
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,040
too many are pursuing you.

996
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,560
You lost your card,

997
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,350
and all of them

998
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,040
wanted to get in touch with you,

999
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,920
claiming that they'd
help you find the card.

1000
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
You asked me to lay low,

1001
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,950
so I did.

1002
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,560
I just posted
the lost item information once,

1003
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,760
and there were 13 people in two days.

1004
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,920
13 people asked me for the card,

1005
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,350
pretending to be you.

1006
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,520
Think about that.

1007
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,800
And then,

1008
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,920
I sent a legal warning

1009
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,710
to every one of them.

1010
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,190
This is called sting operation.

1011
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,110
Do you know that?

1012
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,920
Affairs are bad for your wallet.

1013
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,070
I'm trying to save money for you.

1014
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,040
All right.

1015
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Fulfill your promise.

1016
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,310
Go get some food for me.

1017
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,280
I'll take a good look at my work.

1018
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,640
I'll swipe your card.

1019
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,350
Mine's out of money.

1020
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,830
Wait.

1021
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,640
Qian Wei.

1022
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,230
Qian Wei.

1023
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,640
I…

1024
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,280
I'm short on money recently.

1025
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,660
(Li Chongwen)

1026
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,150
Tang Lyu.

1027
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,230
Quickly, quickly. Come here.

1028
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,230
I mean,

1029
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,040
do you have to do this?

1030
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,520
It's obvious

1031
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,120
that he's here to make peace with you.

1032
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,840
Look at me.

1033
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,000
Look what I'm wearing.

1034
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,190
Zixin.

1035
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,320
How about you have a chat with him?

1036
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,360
I'll find my opportunity to escape.

1037
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,360
What will I chat with him about?

1038
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,150
Just go, go.

1039
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,800
Senior.

1040
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,910
You're here to see Shiyun, right?

1041
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,360
Yes.

1042
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,840
Her club is doing an activity today.

1043
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,080
She won't be back for now.

1044
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,470
Could you give this to her,

1045
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,120
please?

1046
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,280
(Sleep. Hope to see you spirited next time.)
And tell her

1047
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,400
(Keep a 50-meter distance)
that I'm over it.

1048
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,760
(from the gate when you date.)
that I'm over it.

1049
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,670
I'll ask her out some other day.

1050
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,040
Sure, sure.

1051
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:16,910
It's fine.

1052
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,950
I... I'm off, then.

1053
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,040
Thank you.

1054
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,950
One piece for Qian Wei.

1055
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,560
One piece for Zixin.

1056
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,150
Won't you eat some?

1057
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,320
It's too sweet.

1058
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,670
I can't eat any.

1059
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,840
The two of us can't finish

1060
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,000
such a big cake.

1061
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,670
It's fine. Take your time.

1062
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,390
What's the matter with you?

1063
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,800
I had it coming, right?

1064
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,320
I'm not a sweet darling,

1065
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,430
but I have to pretend that I am.

1066
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:54,910
And

1067
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,190
I'm doing a bad job pretending it.

1068
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,870
But I also don't want to be exposed.

1069
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,120
I'm in a dilemma.

1070
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm like a monkey in a circus.

1071
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,840
That's what I am.

1072
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,560
The problem isn't unsolvable.

1073
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,470
I'll help you.

1074
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,670
You can throw away

1075
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,390
all of your leather jackets

1076
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,630
and remove

1077
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,360
all the rivets.

1078
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,560
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

1079
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,280
Wait.

1080
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,190
I'll fight the one who dares

1081
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,190
to touch my precious jackets
to the death.

1082
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,840
See? You've made

1083
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,950
your choice, haven't you?

1084
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,040
It's difficult for one

1085
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,760
to change her nature.

1086
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,390
Plus,

1087
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,040
I'm sure the one who really loves you

1088
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,800
wants you to be

1089
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,150
who you are.

1090
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,390
And yes,

1091
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,080
you can choose to give up
certain things for a better outcome.

1092
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,040
But as your friend,

1093
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,760
I still hope

1094
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,910
the one who loves you

1095
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,520
loves the way you are.

1096
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,430
I second that.

1097
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,710
You are right.

1098
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,040
I should be decisive.

1099
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,000
What are you doing?

1100
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,280
It's only a piece of advice.

1101
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,950
I didn't ask you to murder anyone.

1102
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
What are you talking about?

1103
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,040
I want you to help

1104
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,120
get the real me back.

1105
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,120
You came.

1106
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,560
Want some?

1107
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,670
How come you've become like this?

1108
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,910
Did something happen?

1109
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,760
No.

1110
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,710
I just made a decision

1111
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,630
that I'm going to stop lying to you.

1112
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,080
Nor to myself.

1113
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,520
What do you mean?

1114
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,600
If

1115
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,600
I was like this

1116
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,840
when you saw me for the first time,

1117
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,230
would you still like me?

1118
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,560
Shiyun,

1119
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,840
are you still mad at me?

1120
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,040
I'm not mad at you anymore.

1121
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,120
Tang Lyu.

1122
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,840
I'm sorry

1123
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,630
that I'm not your type of girl.

1124
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,630
I climbed trees at the age of five.

1125
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,910
I climbed over the walls
at the age of seven.

1126
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,150
I got into fights at the age of ten.

1127
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,470
I enjoy drinking beer.

1128
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,430
I enjoy rock music.

1129
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,910
I enjoy

1130
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,360
unhygienic street food.

1131
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,600
I

1132
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,150
am willing to soften myself

1133
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,120
for you,

1134
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,910
but a tigress

1135
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,080
can never be a kitten.

1136
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,670
You weren't like this before.

1137
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,430
That's because I love you.

1138
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,080
And I wanted you
to love me back so much.

1139
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,870
When the first time I saw you,

1140
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,280
you were in white.

1141
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,870
I thought to myself,

1142
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,280
"This is the one."

1143
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,080
So I worked very hard

1144
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,190
to be able

1145
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,360
to match with you.

1146
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,910
I

1147
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,390
thought that I could change.

1148
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,910
That I could be your type of girl.

1149
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,390
But over time, I have realized

1150
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,040
that I still want

1151
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,670
to be who I really am.

1152
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,360
Shiyun,

1153
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,190
you have been brainwashed

1154
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,670
by some misleading trends.

1155
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,390
You know?

1156
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,120
This is the Barnum effect.

1157
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,950
Due to subjective thinking,

1158
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,910
one

1159
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,630
has the tendency to believe

1160
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,040
that a certain character

1161
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,800
suits him or her well.

1162
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,520
You have been such a good girl,

1163
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,040
so when

1164
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,390
you see some bad girls,

1165
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,120
you'd look forward to their lives.

1166
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,760
You'd think

1167
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,630
you can be one of them, too.

1168
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,630
And you'd collect all kinds of evidence

1169
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,560
to convince yourself

1170
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,600
that you can be bad.

1171
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,950
Shiyun,

1172
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,470
you're like a mindless trend follower.

1173
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,600
Don't bring it

1174
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,630
to the level of "being yourself".

1175
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,150
You sound

1176
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,190
exactly like my parents.

1177
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,280
But I never listened to them.

1178
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,870
I don't care about that…

1179
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,430
That Barnum effect you talked about.

1180
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,150
I just don't like high-heels.

1181
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,950
I don't like a baby voice.

1182
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,910
I don't like dresses.

1183
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,710
I don't care what the world

1184
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,870
expects me to be.

1185
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,870
Even if the whole world thinks

1186
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,910
I'm wrong,

1187
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,120
I will hold on

1188
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,430
to the things
that I believe are correct.

1189
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,520
I'm not the only man

1190
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,950
who likes cute and soft girls.

1191
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,520
It's just

1192
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,870
girls are supposed to be like that.

1193
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,710
Look at yourself.

1194
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,390
Look at your

1195
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,470
inappropriate costume and makeup.

1196
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,000
You know what?

1197
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,320
This is depravation.

1198
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,760
For you,

1199
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,190
I'm willing to try

1200
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,230
the clothes that I'd

1201
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,120
never put on before.

1202
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,080
Can't you at least

1203
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,430
try to accept who I am?

1204
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:17,760
Maybe

1205
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,470
you will like the real me.

1206
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,320
Serve the dishes, please.

1207
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,600
I can't believe

1208
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,000
this restaurant serves this.

1209
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,560
Don't you know the stink of it…

1210
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,800
I paid for all the tables.

1211
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,870
I ordered

1212
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,000
takeaways from
the river snail rice noodle stand

1213
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,190
across the street.

1214
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,120
This is your favorite restaurant.

1215
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,630
This is my favorite food.

1216
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,910
We can have

1217
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,190
river snail rice noodle
in a western-style restaurant.

1218
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,520
This way,

1219
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,000
you can enjoy the style,

1220
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,230
and I can enjoy my favorite food.

1221
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,080
I don't know about chemistry.

1222
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,950
I know

1223
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,190
it smells bad,

1224
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,910
but it tastes really good.

1225
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,320
Could you

1226
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,040
take just one bite for me,

1227
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,470
