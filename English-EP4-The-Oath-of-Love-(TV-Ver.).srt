2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,220
Dr. Gu.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,100
(Doctor's Office 2)

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,140
Dr. Gu.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,660
- I'm going back to the office.
- Okay.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,140
Dr. Gu.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,420
Here you are.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,900
Dr. Gu.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,940
Are you doing radio gymnastics

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,100
in front of my office?

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,020
Dr. Gu.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,620
What's the matter?

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,140
Look! The aliens.

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,500
Lin Zhixiao!

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,700
Not me. It's your illusion.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,780
The subscriber you dialed is busy.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,660
Please try later.

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,140
(EMK: Have you ticked off
these scenic spots?)

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,340
(Sansan: Coffee is delicious)

20
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,740
Sansan.

21
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,780
What's the matter?

22
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,900
I was wrong.

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,620
That day,

24
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,020
I didn't know clearly…

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,820
If you

26
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,140
are still not creative like this,

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,740
I advise you to stop.

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,900
(I've done a lot of wrongs.)

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,620
(I can't read your mind.)

30
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,460
(I don't know what you think
of our relationship.)

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,060
(I will always like you until…)

32
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,220
(old me old you)

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,180
Are you paying tribute

34
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,740
to Love Actually?

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,940
It doesn't matter what I pay tribute to.

36
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,260
Don't you answer it?

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,980
She is not important.

38
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
My priority

39
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,220
is you now.

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,580
If I create inconveniences,

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,260
I can give you a minute.

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,420
No, no, no.

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,060
You didn't.

44
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,140
It's very convenient.

45
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,300
Nothing inconvenient.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
It's just a video call.

47
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,220
You can just watch it right here.

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,500
Hello.

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,220
Gu Xiao.

50
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,100
When are you coming to see me?

51
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,740
I...

52
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,620
What are you doing, Gu Xiao?

53
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,980
Gu Xiao.

54
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,180
- Gu Xiao.
- Bye.

55
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,220
Why didn't you call me?

56
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,940
Call me.

57
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,260
Gu Xiao, what are you doing?

58
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,380
I have some proper business to do now.

59
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,140
I will call you later.

60
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,860
Bye.

61
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,660
Lin Zhixiao.

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,820
Dr. Gu, I've been waiting for you.

63
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,940
What are you doing here?

64
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
I'm here...

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,900
I... I...

66
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,780
I was just waiting for you
in your office.

67
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,100
I noticed you weren't there,

68
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
so I have to wait for you here.

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm dining out.

70
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,260
You can come with me.

71
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,940
(Doctor's Lounge)

72
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Okay!

73
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,620
Dr. Gu, let me treat you.

74
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,740
Sansan, emergency!

75
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,300
I need to find a restaurant
nearby the hospital

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,540
to treat Dr. Gu.

77
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,980
A high-end one.
Quickly recommend me one.

78
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,700
(If time could stop at the moment)
Only the two of you?

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
(when we first met)
Yeah, I made an appointment.

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,140
- Okay, this way, please.
- Ms. Lin.

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,340
Is this place good?

83
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,900
- Yeah, it's delicious. Trust me.
- This way.

84
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,900
Here.

85
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,780
Thank you.

86
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,860
Is this the seat we reserved?

87
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,620
Yes, it is.

88
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,060
Thank you.

89
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,900
This is our menu.

90
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,700
Thank you.

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,420
Today is Couple Theme Day.

92
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,900
Couple Theme Day?

93
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,340
I'm sorry, I-I don't know

94
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,660
today is a special...

95
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,860
We have three packages.

96
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,100
For 288 yuan,

97
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,940
388 yuan

98
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,020
and 588 yuan respectively.

99
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,660
Which one would you like?

100
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,420
Talk to me. Talk to me. It's my treat.

101
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,020
Got it.

102
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,660
Looks like your girlfriend's
in charge of the money.

103
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,180
No, no, no.

104
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,060
No, no, no.

105
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,020
Just...

106
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,300
What kind of package do you want?

107
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,500
In our 588 yuan package,

108
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,580
there is an upgraded dessert,

109
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,780
heart-shaped tiramisu.

110
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,340
Its name is Devotion.

111
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,620
It has a good meaning.

112
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,940
Would you like to try it?

113
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,740
No, it's okay. It's okay.

114
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,020
I'll choose myself.

115
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,660
We'll have a 288 yuan package.

116
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,500
Thank you.

117
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,740
Okay, just a minute.

118
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,340
Lin Zhixiao,

119
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,660
I thought you were looking for me

120
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,260
because you want to ask about
your father's surgical plan.

121
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,740
Looks like now

122
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,860
there's something even harder to say.

123
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,700
Lin Zhixiao.

124
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,020
Well…

125
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,940
You can't really be

126
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,260
looking for a date.

127
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
No, no, Dr. Gu.

128
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,380
Don't get me wrong.

129
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,700
I didn't mean that.

130
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,100
I just...

131
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,420
It's...

132
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,340
not easy to ask.

133
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,220
But

134
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,260
I still have to ask.

135
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,660
It's...

136
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,300
Dr. Gu,

137
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,900
please operate on my father.

138
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,260
Thank you.

139
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,620
Wei, you're not home yet.

140
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,860
Du, you're just in time.

141
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,620
Come here.

142
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,220
Okay.

143
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,820
Handle this as usual.

144
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,380
After the patient's family do this,

145
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,900
they will feel at ease.

146
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,420
Who sent it this time?

147
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,620
Lin Zhixiao.

148
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Lin Zhixiao?

149
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,380
Yeah.

150
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,700
She gave you a red envelope.

151
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,180
Does that mean you're not leaving

152
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,860
and you're going to operate
on Lin Jianguo?

153
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,740
She's not asking me to do my best
in surgery.

154
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,300
But she misunderstood me

155
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,660
because I don't want to
operate on her father.

156
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,180
It's okay.

157
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,700
Anyway, in two days,

158
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,300
my transfer application
will be approved.

159
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,500
That one.

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,380
Does it hurt?

161
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,260
It's okay.

162
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
I have paid the bills.

163
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,940
Mm.

164
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,980
Zhixiao.

165
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,340
Why don't you go get me something?

166
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,980
Come out and I'll tell you
how to get there.

167
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,740
It's alright.

168
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,380
What's the matter, Ms. Li?

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,580
The red envelope is returned.

170
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Red envelope?

171
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,420
Red envelope for Dr. Gu?

172
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,180
I went to pick up your dad's medicine.

173
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,420
When I was paying,

174
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,500
I found out that there is more money
in the card.

175
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
It is just the amount of the red envelope.

176
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,740
If it wasn't him, who could it be?

177
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,740
Dr. Gu returned the red envelope.

178
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,380
Do you think he thinks we paid less?

179
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,140
Or are there other reasons?

180
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,220
Who knows?

181
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,380
I think he's made up his mind

182
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,940
not to operate on your dad.

183
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,060
Come on, Ms. Li.

184
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,260
Don't worry about it.

185
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,100
I'll convince him.

186
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,700
What can you do?

187
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,500
No worries.

188
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,100
I'll take care of it, okay?

189
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,060
All right, get inside.

190
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,420
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence!

191
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,940
I was looking for you.

192
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,900
Dr. Gu, I think you're a very good

193
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,460
and responsible doctor.

194
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,700
I don't know

195
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,780
what happened to me before,

196
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,140
but I took leave of my sense,

197
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,740
and I said something strange

198
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,980
and stupid to you.

199
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,100
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

200
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,300
I won't say that again.

201
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,420
Our Dr. Gu is a…

202
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,860
It's dangerous to walk
like this in the hospital.

203
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,180
Please walk properly.

204
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,140
Okay.

205
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,820
Our Dr. Gu cares so much

206
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
about our patients' family.

207
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,780
Dr. Gu.

208
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,180
I know you must have a reason

209
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,860
why you can't do the surgery,

210
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,980
but do tell.

211
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,740
If you tell me,
we can solve it together.

212
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,100
- If you don't, how are we…?
- Hey, Du.

213
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,860
- Dr. Gu, anything I can do for you?
- Oh, right.

214
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,220
Bed 25 needs to have
the medication changed.

215
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,580
Bed 45 needs to have
the drainage tube removed.

216
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,420
Bed 46 needs to be discharged.

217
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,300
Have you done them all?

218
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,220
Of course, Dr. Gu.

219
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,620
You've already told me

220
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,260
when you're on your ward rounds.

221
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,020
You told me to take care of them soon.

222
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,180
I've already done it

223
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,980
and submitted all the records
to the nurse station.

224
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,060
I know

225
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,500
I told you this morning.

226
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,980
I'm just reminding you

227
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,540
so you don't make any mistakes.

228
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,700
And,

229
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,020
have you written the index of the paper

230
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,860
I asked you to write?

231
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,180
Not only is there
a problem with the index,

232
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,140
but there are also
many omissions in your literature.

233
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,260
I've rewritten it all.

234
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,060
What's wrong with you today?
You didn't sleep well?

235
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,900
Last night in the office,

236
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,300
you guided me to correct my paper.

237
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,740
Very well.

238
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,940
Did you eat?

239
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,780
What did you eat?

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,580
Wei, don't scare me.

241
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,180
Did I do something wrong?

242
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,500
Just tell me.

243
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,100
What are you talking about?

244
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm just caring about

245
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,980
your daily life.

246
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,340
Thank you for your care, Dr. Gu.

247
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,300
I'm assisting Dr. Chen's surgery.

248
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,420
I need to get ready for it.

249
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,620
I really need to go.

250
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,500
Sure, go.

251
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,100
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

252
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,500
Oh, right, Xiaowei…

253
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,420
Dr. Du is not available,

254
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,980
but I am, Dr. Gu.

255
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
Lin Zhixiao.

256
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,700
Your father doesn't need you
to take care of him today?

257
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,100
- Do you have a lot of time?
- Yes.

258
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,700
Don't waste time on me.

259
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,580
Dr. Gu.

260
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,060
Mr. Lin is in very good condition.

261
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,780
I have plenty of time.

262
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,780
- You have nothing to do, right?
- Yes.

263
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,820
I'm suddenly hungry.

264
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Get me something to eat.

265
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,660
The whole wheat bread
I bought this morning.

266
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,740
Please enjoy it, Dr. Gu.

267
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,260
I'm thirsty and I don't want to eat.

268
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,540
Taken care of that, too.

269
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,980
The cup has been sanitized

270
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,420
and has wolfberries in it.

271
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,580
I made it myself.

272
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,300
I'm not thirsty now either.

273
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,660
Where do you want to go?

274
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
I'm coming with you, Dr. Gu.

275
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Dr. Gu.

276
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,780
Wait for me.

277
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,380
Where are you going?

278
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,980
Coming inside?

279
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,580
No, no.

280
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,980
Suit yourself, Dr. Gu.

281
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,780
I'll wait for you at the door, Dr. Gu.

282
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,900
No rush. Take your time.

283
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,740
Hello, Director.

284
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,580
Mm.

285
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,300
Please, please.

286
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,740
Director.

287
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,100
Gu.

288
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,500
This is a hospital.

289
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,900
Watch your actions.

290
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
The girl outside,

291
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,980
don't tell me she's your ex.

292
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
I see you're avoiding her.

293
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,820
Director,

294
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,860
she's just a patient's family.

295
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,940
I can't operate on her father

296
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,340
and she keeps asking questions,

297
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
so I'm avoiding her now.

298
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,740
A patient's family?

299
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,260
You don't have to be so afraid of her.

300
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,860
I'm not afraid of her, I…

301
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,140
In our hospital,

302
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,940
there are other surgeons

303
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,660
besides you.

304
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,620
You are not obliged

305
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,300
to operate on a specific patient.

306
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,140
Besides,

307
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,780
when you were busy,

308
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
you turned down many patients.

309
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,580
What?

310
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,700
Why is it so hard for you this time?

311
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,500
Are you

312
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,740
afraid to operate on that patient,

313
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,020
or do you want to operate

314
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,300
and are afraid you won't do it well?

315
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,940
Think about it.

316
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,780
Dr. Gu.

317
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Dr. Gu.

318
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,100
I know you're still in there.

319
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,860
It's okay. I'm not rushing you.

320
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,980
Take your time.

321
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,980
I just want to tell you,

322
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,340
we still

323
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,660
have to see each other later,

324
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,060
so, see you.

325
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,660
Be good, Qiuqiu.

326
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,500
It's okay, Qiuqiu.

327
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,460
I don't want Dr. Yan.

328
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,580
I want Dr. Gu!

329
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
I want Dr. Gu!

330
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,340
Dr. Gu is the best!

331
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,140
Dr. Yan is also very good.

332
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,300
Yes, Qiuqiu.

333
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,740
Dr. Yan is very good.

334
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,620
- Be good, OK?
- No!

335
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,100
If it's not Dr. Gu,
I won't do the surgery.

336
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,420
- It's okay. It's okay.
- You bad boy!

337
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,540
- Mrs. Mrs.
- Mrs.

338
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,940
Don't be angry.

339
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,860
It's okay. It's okay.

340
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,780
Come on, Qiuqiu, Ultraman.

341
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,020
Be like him.

342
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,540
Qiuqiu.

343
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,620
Don't cry. Don't cry.

344
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,380
- Be good, Qiuqiu.
- Here, Ultraman.

345
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,420
OK? Take it.

346
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
No, I don't want it!

347
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,020
Hello?

348
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,540
Don't cry.

349
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,980
Hello, Dr. Yan, it's me.

350
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,700
I have

351
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,780
a favor to ask you.

352
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,340
Can I go to the Operating Room

353
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,860
for Qiuqiu's surgery this afternoon?

354
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,020
I know it's…

355
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,260
I know it's very complicated,

356
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
so I'm calling you

357
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,380
to ask you a favor.

358
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,620
(In-patient)

359
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,940
Is Dr. Gu here?

360
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,300
Don't worry, Qiuqiu.

361
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,500
Dr. Yan can do your surgery well.

362
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,420
I'll stay with you

363
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,540
until the surgery is over, okay?

364
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,700
This book has 899 pages.

365
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,780
I have to memorize them all.

366
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,180
It's too hard for me.

367
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,620
Gu Wei.

368
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,020
You are just in time.

369
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,020
Help me.

370
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,060
There's so much
to memorize in this book.

371
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,860
Can you help me highlight it?

372
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,380
What do you think?

373
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,500
Do you think patients will get sick
according to the highlights?

374
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,220
Patients put their lives in your hands

375
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,700
because they trust you.

376
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,500
We doctors

377
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,140
can't take any chances.

378
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,580
We must be prepared for anything.

379
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,700
Memorize them all.

380
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,340
I'll check you next Monday.

381
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,100
Okay.

382
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,220
If there is any uncertainty,

383
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,660
we can never

384
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,380
jeopardize the patient's life.

385
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,980
Dr. Gu.

386
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,460
Here you are.

387
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,780
I have something to tell you.

388
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,180
Take a seat.

389
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,780
Thank you.

390
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,380
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

391
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,580
Dr. Gu.

392
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,420
Sorry, I…

393
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,580
I broke it. I am so sorry.

394
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,140
This is a birthday present for Qiuqiu.

395
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,020
Let me.

396
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,500
Let me fix it for you.

397
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,900
Hold on.

398
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,620
What's broken is broken.

399
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,700
It can't be repaired.

400
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,460
No way.

401
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,980
I can fix it.

402
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,580
Hold on.

403
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,900
Look, well bandaged.

404
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,020
Here you are.

405
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,260
Because of my teacher.

406
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,100
I couldn't save him.

407
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,020
So now

408
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,260
my shaking hands

409
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,900
are caused by my mental disorder.

410
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,020
So

411
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,020
I shouldn't have surgery on anyone

412
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,460
in this situation.

413
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,420
Understand?

414
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,780
So it's not that

415
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,100
you didn't like my gift.

416
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,740
Shall I get it back for you?

417
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,020
That anti-hair loss product

418
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,380
works really well.

419
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,420
I mean it.

420
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,900
(Bar Party Group)

421
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,380
Find her for me.

422
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,220
Thank you.

423
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,260
(Bar Party Group)
Find her for me.

424
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,260
(Bar Party Group)
Thank you.

425
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,580
(Bar Party Group)

426
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,100
(Bar Party Group)
Here she is.

427
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,620
One more Depth Charge.

428
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,460
Easy.

429
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,500
I will pay.

430
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,780
It's so boring to drink alone.

431
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,980
Let me join you.

432
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,540
How did you know I was here?

433
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,020
This may be God's arrangement.

434
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,980
Whatever she ordered, double it.

435
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,580
Do you really want to drink with me?

436
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,980
Yes.

437
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,500
Do you dare?

438
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,020
So exciting.

439
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,020
I like it.

440
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,420
So it's not that

441
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,340
you didn't like my gift.

442
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,660
Shall I get it back for you?

443
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,180
That anti-hair loss product
works really well.

444
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,260
I didn't lie to you.

445
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,020
My hairline has grown out

446
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,860
since I used this.

447
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,820
I got it.

448
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
What's wrong?

449
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,620
Mr. Lin, let me ask you.

450
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,300
If a person confides his sadness

451
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,580
to you,

452
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,780
should you comfort him

453
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,580
right away?

454
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,980
What?

455
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
Go to sleep. It's late.

456
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,060
Okay.

457
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,340
Where is she?

458
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,580
She's gone.

459
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,460
Sir, please settle the bill.

460
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,100
(Fool)

461
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,420
You are such a good drinker.

462
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,620
(Fool)

463
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,980
I will take you down sooner or later.

464
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,100
Wine can really boost courage.

465
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,140
- Hello, Mr. Lin.
- Hello, Mr. Lin.

466
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,260
Hello.

467
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,820
Feel free.

468
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,780
We're not in the office now.

469
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,740
You can hold your hands.

470
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,020
It's okay.

471
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,220
It's so kind of you

472
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,580
to visit him in person.

473
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,900
It's what we should do.

474
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,180
We heard that Mr. Lin is ill.

475
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,220
So we came to visit him.

476
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,460
That's it, Ms. Li.

477
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,900
It's Zhixiao's fault.

478
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,980
Mr. Lin is sick and hospitalized.

479
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,500
She didn't tell us

480
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,540
about such a big thing.

481
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,580
Lin Zhixiao did the right thing.

482
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,700
I just got a gastric ulcer.

483
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,100
You don't have to be nervous.

484
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,620
I feel

485
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,780
your kindness.

486
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,820
I am so happy.

487
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,300
Exactly.

488
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,540
If I am half as considerate as them,

489
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,420
would you be satisfied, Mr. Lin?

490
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,100
How long will

491
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,460
your exchange study last?

492
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,580
It's short. Only about three months.

493
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,420
That's great.

494
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,980
You can take this opportunity

495
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,700
to get to know the school.

496
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,220
If appropriate,

497
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,820
you may consider studying abroad
for postgraduate study.

498
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,460
Yes.

499
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,220
By the way, Mr. Lin,

500
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,180
we heard that

501
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,820
the Faculty of Music over there is
also very good.

502
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,980
We can get some information back
for Zhixiao.

503
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,820
Be careful then.

504
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,420
She may lose face abroad.

505
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,500
Mr. Lin.

506
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,180
Keep the bottom line
for further contact.

507
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,260
If I achieve something in the future,

508
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,540
I will take Ms. Li abroad

509
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,780
instead of you.

510
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,740
Don't blame me for being stingy then.

511
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,940
By then,

512
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,300
I will be grey-haired, teetering

513
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,740
and can't even walk.

514
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,100
I won't travel anymore.

515
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,300
Zhixiao.

516
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,620
Prepare fruit for them.

517
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,500
- Yes, wash the apples.
- Okay.

518
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,300
- Take a seat. Feel free.
- Take a seat.

519
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,180
You take a seat. I will go with Zhixiao.

520
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,380
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

521
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,060
Let's go.

522
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,260
Zhixiao.

523
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,780
I heard from Sansan

524
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,820
that Mr. Lin…

525
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,100
Yes.

526
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,180
Gastric cancer.

527
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,140
But no one told him.

528
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,060
It was kept secret.

529
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,340
Just keep it in mind.

530
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,380
Why are you still arguing with him
like before?

531
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,220
It may irritate him.

532
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,420
Listen.

533
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,420
The best way to treat a patient

534
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,100
at this time

535
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,940
is to treat him as a healthy person.

536
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,540
It's the best for him.

537
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,980
Zhixiao.

538
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,220
I feel you are more mature.

539
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,380
You thoroughly remoulded yourself

540
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,820
just in a few days.

541
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,500
It's okay.

542
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,780
Not a big deal.

543
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,820
Why so sad?

544
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,540
Let me tell you something happy.

545
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,220
Okay.

546
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,380
Good news.

547
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,940
What good news?

548
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,700
Are you and Jin Shi
planning to register your marriage?

549
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,420
I'll transfer you 10 yuan.

550
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,700
What are you talking about?

551
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,100
I've been keeping an eye

552
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,020
on your orchestra

553
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,660
for the past few days
you were not there.

554
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,540
The principal cellist

555
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,620
has a temporary emergency

556
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,180
and can't participate
in the summer show.

557
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,220
What good news is this?

558
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,300
What does it have to do with me?

559
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,020
Come on.

560
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,180
Why are you so heartless?

561
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,780
Think about it. If she's absent,

562
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,220
the orchestra will need a replacement.

563
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,860
Who else can play the cello?

564
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,500
Only you!

565
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,060
It makes sense!

566
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,980
I have to give it a go this time

567
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,540
and show them that I, Lin Zhixiao,

568
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,740
am a talented cellist.

569
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,820
Let's go wash the apples.

570
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,500
Okay. Mr. Jin, what do you think

571
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,300
of the rhythm?

572
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,380
I think

573
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,660
the speed of 23-27

574
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,540
can be slower.

575
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,900
23 to 27?

576
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,980
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

577
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,620
Everyone.

578
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,580
That's all for today's rehearsal.

579
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,420
Thank you.

580
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,060
Mr. Jin.

581
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,020
Zhixiao.

582
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,180
I would like to ask you

583
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,460
when I could be transferred back

584
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,900
to the cello team?

585
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,300
You know the original piece

586
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,860
required each cellist

587
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,540
to perform a solo.

588
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,380
- So…
- I got it, sir.

589
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,540
I will definitely take the time
to practice.

590
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,500
Please don't worry.

591
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,820
I mean

592
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,220
we have decided to change the piece
this time.

593
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,060
There is no more vacancy
in the cello team.

594
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,740
There will be many opportunities
in the future.

595
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,100
That's it.

596
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,700
Dr. Gu.

597
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,780
Are you off duty?

598
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,620
Yes.

599
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,500
Why do you come here?

600
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,180
I've been in a seminar
for the whole morning

601
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,780
and heard too many suggestions.

602
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,220
So I come here
to get some air to sober up.

603
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,420
You seem

604
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,100
not as noisy as usual.

605
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,940
Noisy?

606
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,700
I'm quiet all the time.

607
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,180
What's wrong?

608
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,940
What happened to you?

609
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
Never mind.

610
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,140
Just the teacher of the orchestra
weeded me out

611
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,700
because of my incapability.

612
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,740
I'm left out.

613
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,700
I only have to play the triangle.

614
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,900
There're several cellists
in the orchestra,

615
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,020
but only one plays the triangle.

616
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,220
So, you're unique.

617
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,900
You're so good at comforting.

618
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,460
I'm fine.

619
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,100
You don't have to comfort me.

620
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,940
I didn't take playing the cello
as my future profession

621
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,780
and practice hard for it

622
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,380
when I was little.

623
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,780
It was in high school

624
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,300
when I started to work hard.

625
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
But I'm not talented,

626
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,460
so I was neglected in school.

627
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,460
I'm used to it.

628
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,100
Don't worry.

629
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,820
I won't get depressed for long

630
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,900
or give up.

631
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,740
For me,

632
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,420
a tin of cola

633
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,540
will cure everything.

634
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,340
Good.

635
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm suddenly cheered up.

636
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,500
How about you, Dr. Gu?

637
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,060
You mentioned your teacher yesterday.

638
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,620
If you trust me,

639
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,940
you can talk about it with me.

640
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,740
Of course, if you don't,

641
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,900
I won't push you.

642
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,020
This is not a secret.

643
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,500
About a month ago,

644
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,340
my teacher, Liang Zhou

645
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,140
was hospitalized
because of pancreatic cancer.

646
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,220
I was responsible for his treatment.

647
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,180
Teacher,

648
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,740
I suggest a laparoscopic
distal pancreatectomy

649
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,220
and splenectomy.

650
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,860
It will cause a small wound
and recover quickly.

651
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,300
I think it's suitable for you.

652
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,220
Gu Wei, how's Liang Zhou?

653
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,660
Don't worry, Mrs.

654
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,980
The surgery went well.

655
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,620
A few days later,

656
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,700
his situation turned worse rapidly.

657
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,100
Dr. Gu.

658
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,700
It's has been over 30 minutes.

659
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,660
Dr. Gu.

660
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,780
Get away.

661
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,380
Rest assured, teacher,

662
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,380
I won't let you down.

663
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,220
OK.

664
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,900
Come back.

665
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,980
Come back.

666
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,180
(…my only wish is to save people.
Keep moving on and stay true to my mission. Liang Zhou)

667
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,500
Come back.

668
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
So,

669
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,100
What's wrong

670
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,700
with Mr. Liang's treatment?

671
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,460
The acute hemorrhage after surgery.

672
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,540
Many people must have comforted you

673
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,060
that it was not your fault.

674
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,540
Why do you still have a mental barrier?

675
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
Is it because of

676
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,140
"not sure"?

677
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,180
Because it's not sure,

678
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,260
you don't know

679
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,780
whether your treatment is wrong.

680
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,100
That's why you have a mental barrier.

681
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
I'm right.

682
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,020
That's it.

683
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,940
I saw you rescuing a patient

684
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,620
in the ward that day.

685
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,100
I know you must be the genius type

686
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,300
who wants to control everything.

687
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,780
People like you

688
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,100
believe that you can change the world

689
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,660
with your strength.

690
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,300
So, when something goes wrong,

691
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,020
you feel more obliged

692
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,740
and helpless

693
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,180
than others.

694
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,980
In fact,
when you stride over the barrier

695
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,140
and look back,

696
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,860
you'll find it's not a big deal.

697
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,500
Well,

698
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,740
have you ever been helpless?

699
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,700
See, I said

700
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,780
you've met too few setbacks.

701
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,940
People like us

702
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,100
have already

703
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,020
grown thick-skinned.

704
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,140
Now, for me,

705
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,340
each setback is the impetus to move on.

706
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,780
That's right.

707
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,660
These are the words

708
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,620
for kids at your age.

709
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,100
What do you mean?

710
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,780
How can you start personal abuse?

711
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,060
Who is the kid?

712
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,700
I'm a mature lady.

713
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,100
You're the student
of Huaqing University, right?

714
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,940
Yes.

715
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,140
I was, too.

716
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,460
Bachelor of medicine in the year 2006.

717
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,700
Then you're my senior.

718
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,380
Nice to meet you.

719
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,820
The year 2006.

720
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,980
You're so much older than me.

721
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,020
It's hard to tell.

722
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,420
You look so young.

723
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Really?

724
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,860
At least you have so many hairs.

725
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,060
If you used my shampoo,

726
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,700
your hair can be better.

727
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,180
Mm.

728
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,860
Can't you take a joke?

729
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,820
How come you get mad?

730
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,260
Don't be mad.

731
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,380
I was joking.

732
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,620
You know what, Dr. Gu?

733
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,220
I envy you so much.

734
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,580
Truly.

735
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,620
I think you

736
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,900
have the gift of a good surgeon.

737
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,820
The gift is desirable

738
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,500
for many people.

739
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,180
If I'm as talented as you,

740
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,780
I must stand on the world-class stage

741
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,540
despite of any difficulty.

742
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,300
Anyway,

743
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
just confront the difficulty
when I meet it.

744
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,100
Things will go well when we come to them.

745
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,620
Or I'll just make them well.

746
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,620
Mr. Lin.

747
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,380
Hello, Mr. Lin.

748
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,900
Where are you?

749
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,220
I took a trip back to school.

750
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,300
What are you shouting for?

751
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,420
Could you please respect me?

752
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
I've been back now.

753
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,220
Wait for a while.

754
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,660
Hurry up.

755
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,220
Get it, get it, bye-bye.

756
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,020
Mr. Lin, you know him.

757
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
I'm gonna leave.

758
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,620
Come on.

759
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Dr. Gu,

760
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,660
you're really a very good doctor

761
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,940
in my eyes.

762
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,780
Don't give up

763
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,420
even if you don't do the surgery
for Mr. Lin.

764
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,140
See you.

765
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,660
Lin Zhixiao.

766
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,260
What are you up to?

767
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,260
Sticking to it.

768
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,780
Enjoy your food, Mr. Lin.

769
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,700
Why do you get out again?

770
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,100
Mr. Jin.

771
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,900
I know I didn't perform well

772
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,820
and you were dissatisfied with me.

773
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,420
Sorry that

774
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,260
I disappointed you.

775
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,420
I've been playing the cello
since I was little.

776
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,180
But I'm never

777
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
a talented cellist.

778
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,100
Sometimes,

779
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,300
I have to take more time to master

780
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,300
what other people can understand easily.

781
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
Sometimes, I make mistakes

782
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,300
and I feel disappointed in myself.

783
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,900
However,

784
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,180
I have the unique strength,

785
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,780
which is,

786
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,780
never giving up

787
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,420
the dream of being a cellist.

788
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
I'll work tens and hundreds
of time harder

789
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,580
than others.

790
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,100
Though I have to take care
of my dad now,

791
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,020
I'll spend even a minute of spare time

792
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,060
to practice,

793
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,820
understand and study the pieces.

794
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,340
Mr. Jin,

795
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,740
please trust my resolution.

796
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,780
If you allow me to play the cello again,

797
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,980
I'll try my best

798
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,260
and won't let you down.

799
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,420
Mr. Jin,

800
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
please give me another chance.

801
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,620
Zhixiao.

802
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,180
Yes?

803
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,340
=The Oath of Love=
What's Mr. Lin's impression on me?

804
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,180
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)

805
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,540
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
The first impression?

806
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,580
Yes.

807
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,620
A fair-faced man.

808
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,020
Get promoted by relationships.

809
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,820
What?

810
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,940
Yes.

811
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,140
Have you explained it to Mr. Lin?

812
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,740
I didn't get the chance to explain.

813
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,500
Why does Mr. Lin

814
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,100
get this impression on me?

815
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,620
I don't know.

816
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Perhaps, probably, maybe,

817
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,820
it's a misunderstanding.

818
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,260
Mistake.

819
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,540
You said that, right?

820
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,220
No, you're handsome.

821
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,820
