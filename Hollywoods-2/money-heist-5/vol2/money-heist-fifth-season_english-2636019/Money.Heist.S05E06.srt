you need to control your breathing.

39
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,916
Come on, breathe.

40
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,125
Hold your breath

41
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,833

00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:52,208
...two, three, four...

43
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,833
And let the air out.

44
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,083
Do it again, Professor.

45
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,208
Take a deep breath.

46
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,708

Colonel,
we've taken down Silene Oliveira, Tokyo.

49
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,166
Ugh, finally, some good news.
Put him in the speakers!

50
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,166
Gentlemen, we've successfully brought down
one of the robbers.

51
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,166
<i>Oliveira held her ground.</i>

52
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,916
Salvador Torrecilla is down.

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,291
Your operation is aborted.
Prepare to be evacuated by air.

61
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,583
No, Colonel.

62
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,208
We are not going to withdraw.

63
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,916
<i>We came in here to complete a mission,</i>

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,458
put an end to this heist,
and that's what we're gonna do.

65
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,458
Sagasta, there's two of you
including the psycho.

66
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,125
Right now, this isn't even a possibility.

67
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,416
You're mistaken,

68
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,541
because this time
they won't see it coming.

69
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,291
<i>So, Colonel, don't order
any other operation.</i>

70
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,416
Over and out.

71
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,625
- Are you sure you're okay?
- It's nothing. Just a loose shard.

72
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,208
Give me your tag.

73
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,416

74
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
I've got a wounded man here.

75
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,041
He needs to be evacuated.

76
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,851
- And the others?
- They're all down.

77
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,458
It's just the wounded man and myself.

78
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,291

101

<i>It's there he met Bogotá.</i>

00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,333
That's our man, Santiago.
He's an underwater welder.

107
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,541
He's been working on platforms
for over 20 years.

108
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,333
Twenty years working
and now you want to be a thief.

109
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,208
With such coarse hands.

110
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,708
Well, yours are so soft
I think I'm gonna use them to jerk off.

111
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,000
If in 20 years you're too scared
to leave a prison like this,

112
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,416
there's only one explanation.
You're a coward.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,375
And we can't bring someone
into the heist that's a coward.

114
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,958
I think this sea
is for cowards, you piece of shit.

115
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,666
You came dressed in your mother's coat.

116
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,375
Let him go, unless you
want to fly with the cormorants.

117

Oh! Ooh.

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,750
Hey, hey.

119
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,208
Why didn't you ever get out?

120
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,750
Because I have seven kids.

121
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,000
Oof, your wife's hips must be
as worn out as the wheel on a mill.

122
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,958
Seven kids with seven
completely different women.

124
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,083
We thought we were
the only romantics left on this earth,

125
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,606
but looks like we found another one!

126
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,875
Ah. It's wonderful.

127
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,875
Can it manage to move 90 tons of gold?

128
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,416
If there's one machine in the world
that could do it, it's this one.

129
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,958
It extracts the aggregates from the seabed
as if it were baby food.

130

131
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,916

133
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,750

134
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,166
There's still ten tons
left to melt, right?

135
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,500
We'll keep melting it
while we get the gold out.

136
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:07,250
Come on, dammit! Today is the big day!
We'll be home for Christmas dinner!

137
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,541
Let's do it!

138
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,208
- <i>Professor</i>.
- Sierra took one of the cars.

139
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,291
- What?
- But we're going after her.

140
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,625
You just let a new mother
with a baby in her arms run away?

141
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,458
<i>Did you sing "Mary Had A Little Lamb"
thinking you were a family?</i>

142
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,500
So what the fuck happened?

143
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,291
- For a moment I got a little lost.
- Sergio. Sergio, listen to me.

144
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,583
You're gonna catch her.
You take care of that.

145
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,708
<i>We'll stay here
and continue with the plan.</i>

146
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,791
Good luck, brother.

147
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,291
Matías, help us with the door.
We're gonna negotiate with the soldiers.

148
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,958
Go ahead. Open the door.

149
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,291
I have a gift for them.

150
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,583
I'm gonna light them up.

151
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,250
Then you negotiate however you want.

152
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,000
Put the weapon down.

153
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,083
No.

154
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,583
What are you gonna say?
That you're all here because of me?

155
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,916
I never even asked to be rescued.

156
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,666
Let it go, Rio.

157
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Give me the weapon.

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,583
Give me the fucking weapon!
No one's gonna die here anymore!

159
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,041
That... That's exactly our problem.

160
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,375
We keep wanting to be the good guys.

161
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,458
But in war, good guys don't exist.

162
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,416
Gandía killed Nairobi.

163
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,791
And what did we do?

164
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,416
Took care of him and let him go.

165
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,041
And what did he do?

166
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,666
He came back and killed Tokyo.

167
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,416
Now we wanna look after
these motherfuckers? What for?

168
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,541
So they can come back
and kill us tomorrow?

169
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,041
And you know why?

170
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,333
Because the truth is,
we don't have the balls

171
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,875
to kill someone in cold blood
like we should have.

172
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,083
When we had Berlin...

173
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,458
he took care of those things.
You knew him, right?

174
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,875
What do you think
he would've done with Gandía?

175
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,833
I'll tell you.

176
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,458
Executed him...

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
for killing Nairobi.

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
And Tokyo would still be alive.

179
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,125
If it was up to me,

180
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,291
you'd be rotting away
in the desert in Algeria.

181
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:47,166
And Nairobi and Tokyo
would still be alive.

182
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,333
As well as the six soldiers
that just died.

183
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,416
But here we are.

184
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,916
And you... you're still alive.

185
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,625
So don't fuck with me
and try not to get anyone else killed.

186
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,416
Matías, take care of the door.

187
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,916
Shit! He's even in the fucking screen.

188
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
It's a safety feature.
You can't disable the camera.

189
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,083
<i>Alicia, we know where you are.
The car is geolocated.</i>

190
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,541
This chase is absurd.

191
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,625
Yeah, no shit.

192
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,375
You can't get away.
If you did, you'd go to jail.

193
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,916
Wow, so now you care if I go to jail?
Or are you trying to clear my name?

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,208
<i>Your name is beyond clearing.</i>

195
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,958
All Tamayo's done is just throw
another shovelful of dirt on you.

196
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,791
Yeah, I'm up to my ass in dirt.
Hmm, kinda like you.

197
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,875
You're incapable of seeing that
because you think you're better than me.

198
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,333
Of course I do.

199
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,916
Tell that to Tokyo and Nairobi.
They're dead because of you.

200
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,625
<i>If you found where we hid Rio,</i>

201
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,916
<i>this could've happened months ago
without making this whole mess</i>,

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
<i>without risking so many lives,</i>

203
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,041
but of course,
that would be just <i>way</i> too simple

204
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,875
for an ego as big as yours, wouldn't it?

205
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,666
You didn't give a shit about that kid.

206
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,958
<i>Or breakfast with the goofy grandma
or taking walks on the beach with Paulita.</i>

207
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,500
It's great for a vacation,

208
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,423
but every fucking day?
Sounds like a shit time.

209
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,041
<i>So one morning you woke up,
looked in the mirror, and said,</i>

210
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,750
<i>"Should I buy a minivan
or set up a huge fucking heist</i>

211
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,708
<i>to get out of
my terrible and boring life?"</i>

212
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,338
Am I right? Or am I right?

213
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,708
Son of a bitch.

214
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,333
It's okay, sweetie.

215
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,916
And no further good manners.

216
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,875
You're going to spend what's left
of the heist tied up and gagged.

217
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,041
I'm sure you'd like that.

218
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,333
I'll follow the road
so I can block Sierra head-on.

219
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,416

I'm not moving.

229

If you don't, you're gonna kill a mother
and her baby. You're not a murderer.

230
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,125
- I've seen how you hold her.
- Stop the car.

231
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,583
Don't act crazy, Alicia!

232
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,625
I'm not acting crazy... I <i>am</i> crazy.

233
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,541
Professor, I've got two flat tires.

234
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,666
Professor!

235
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,500
I can't right now, Marseille.
I can't right now.

236
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,833
Helsinki.

237
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,833
Helsinki, how are you feeling?

238
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,291
If they'd cut my leg off before,

239
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,541
I'd be better by now.

240
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Stockholm...

241
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,166
who died?

242
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,833
Tokyo.

243
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,945
I heard four grenades.

244
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:37,833
Who else?

245
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,833
Six soldiers.

246
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,708
Could've been worse.

247
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,666
Denver and Manila could have died too
and you could've been a widow today.

248
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,875
Yeah.

249
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,333
<i>Zbogom, </i>Tokyo.

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,291
We should've gone in with them
in a simultaneous attack

251
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,875
with several contingents.
That's the way things are done.

252
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,541
- Contingent, contingent, contingent...
- Suárez, Suárez. Suárez!

253
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,875
Tamayo, those five soldiers had children.

254
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,041
Hernando, three kids.

255
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,041
Canalejas, twin girls
who aren't even one year old yet.

256
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,125
- Cobo, one kid and another on the way.
- What did you say?

257
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,958
- That Cobo was expecting...
- That's it! For fuck's sake, that's it.

258
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,625
I want photos
of those soldiers with their children,

259
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,208
eating bonbons, with their little
family pets, on vacation...

260
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,875
What the fuck are you talking about?

261
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,291
Make it look like
a fucking Christmas movie!

262
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,333
We gotta show the world
those disfigured bodies

263
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,166
and how their asses
are covered in shrapnel.

264
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,666
We're gonna parade them around town
like the corpse of fucking Che Guevara.

265
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,500
The tears are gonna fill the streets.

266
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,708
What are you trying to do?

267
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,166
Are you trying to use the pain
of these families to make emotional porn?

268
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,833
Those Robin Hoods have just executed
five national heroes, all right?

269
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,541
And no one's gonna cheer for
a group of murderers.

270
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,541
By tomorrow no one's even
gonna wear a red shirt anymore!

271
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,791
Martínez, get Intelligence on the line,
personnel division.

272
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,041
Come on, are you fucking crazy?

273
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,708
One wrong move and we open fire.

274
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,916
You're wasting your time.
All of them are dead.

275
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,916
This is as far as you'll get, sweetie.

276
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,541
Let's see if what
your friend's saying is true.

277
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,666
Easy now, okay? Do it slow.

278
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,375
She was wearing this.

279
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,458
It's Aníbal Cortés's.

280
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,916
Okay, so what are your terms?

281
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,500
My man needs to get a blood transfusion
and a surgeon. He leaves, and I stay.

282
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,791
I'll be your prisoner
until the heist is done.

283
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,125
No. You stay, he stays,
and we bring in a surgeon.

284
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,458
Colonel Tamayo,

285
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,666
I need you to send a surgeon in here
to treat Ramiro Vázquez.

286
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,910
They're not letting us leave.

287
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,666
<i>We'll get it done.</i>

288
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay, give me the radio
and consider yourself my prisoner.

289
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,041
Do you smoke?

290
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,000
I quit nine months ago
for health reasons, but frankly,

291
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,541
it seems hypocritical.

292
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,208
What happened in there?

293
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,375
Oliveira pulled
the pins on her grenades,

294
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,708
then she let us shoot her down.

295
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,791
When we went to finish her off,
her grenades exploded,

296
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,291
which in turn triggered my men's grenades.

297
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,166
She wasn't really one to surrender.

298
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,958
She would've made an excellent soldier...
<i>if </i>she had chosen the right side.

299
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,208
You still believe there's a right side?

300
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,083
I think the world is chock-full
of fucking bastards.

301
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,458
Politicians are absolute fucking bastards.

302
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,416
But dictators are much worse.

303
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,166
Soldiers like us are
also big fucking bastards.

304
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,250
But terrorists like you are so much worse.

305
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,375
So here we are. Yes, there's right sides.

306
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,875
Paradoxical, don't you think?

307
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,750
That you need to use violence
to keep the peace.

308
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,375
Now you want me to sit here and believe
that you're fighting for a better world?

309
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,458
Is that right?

310
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,333
I'm here out of love
for a man and an idea.

311
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,708
You loved your commandos.

312
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,500
You and I both knew
it was gonna come to this.

313
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,958
And yet, we led them on to death.

314
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,583
Maybe we did them a favor, I don't know.

315
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,291
Or condemned them to something worse.

316
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,166
But there are no right sides
in the inferno, Commander.

317
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:52,875
<i>They say
that when someone dies tragically,</i>

318
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,416
<i>their spirit lingers for a while
in the place where they lost their life.</i>

319
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,666
<i>And that sometimes, for a few seconds,</i>

320
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,958
<i>the living can feel
the dead they once loved.</i>

321
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,083
<i>Rio felt it.</i>

322
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,791
<i>I wanted to tell him it was me,</i>

323
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,583
<i>and that I wasn't gone yet.</i>

324
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,083
<i>That I was at peace.</i>

325
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:21,500
<i>That I wasn't suffering.</i>

326
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,125
<i>And so much more.</i>

327
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,916
My mom invented a trick.
It was a magic door.

328
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:35,041
If I was scared,
I could open it and she'd be right there.

329
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,375
This door will always be open for you.

330
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,791
You can come in whenever you want.

331
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,416
<i>Thank you.</i>

332
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,750
Look at us.

333
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,041
It looks like a scene from a movie.

334
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,625
Pointing our guns
at each other in the rain,

335
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,166
like <i>Liberty Valance</i>.

336
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,791
Has anyone ever
challenged you to a duel, Professor?

337
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,416
They say whoever shoots first
has a better chance of surviving.

338
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,250
Don't force me to prove it, Alicia.
Put the gun down.

339
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,375
Saving Rio was just an excuse.

340
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:17,291
An excuse to rescue your life
from boredom, wasn't it?

341
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,666
Wasn't it?

342
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,125
I've lived most of my life
without an identity...

343
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,916
hiding in obscurity like a ghost.

344
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,208
My life with Raquel has been a dream.

345
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,750
But I also have dreams of my own.

346
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,375
And by kidnapping Rio,
you made those dreams a reality.

347
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:49,000
I understand. So you rescued the kid
to arm-wrestle the State?

348
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,666
Some people dream of bungee jumping.

349
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,375
But me, I wasn't gonna die
without robbing the Bank of Spain.

350
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,208
You fucking narcissist,
egocentric son of a bitch.

351
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:00,125
- <i>God,</i> I love being right.
- If you don't put it down, I'll shoot.

352
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,250
You're not gonna shoot.

353
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,000
Drop the gun.

354
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,125
You're not going to shoot.

355
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,583
You're not gonna shoot.

356
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,708
You bastard.
I didn't think you'd actually do it.

357
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,083
It's a good thing I emptied the clip.

358
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,166
Now we're tied.

359
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,083
We've both shot each other,
both emptied our clips.

360
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,125
Shall we play a tiebreaker?

361
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,375
To shoot or not to shoot?

362
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,916
What shall we do, Professor?

363
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,583
Tokyo died
because she was fed up with paradise.

364
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,458
Because one day, she woke up

365
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,500
and she was tired of paradise.

366
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,166
And you know what? I understand that.

367
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,500
I had my paradise.

368
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,291
I lived by the beach,
really fucking far from the city,

369
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,708
95 km away.

370
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,333
But every Friday,
I came up with a new excuse

371
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,291
to go out partying
because I just had to feel alive.

372
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,958
So I haven't matured as much as I thought.

373
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,958
Dani, we used to go out every fucking day.

374
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,500
I think that we've matured a little bit.

375
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,375
I felt like I didn't fit in.

376
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,375
And that makes me sad.

377
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,875
And you know what I kept thinking about,
even in my paradise?

378
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,083
The two of us.

379
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,125
I remember how we were
the last ones to leave the discos.

380
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,333
I even called you once
from a phone booth at 6:00 a.m.

381
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,656
but it rang once and I hung up.

382
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,916
You got a call from Indonesia, remember?

383
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,750
Mm-hmm.

384
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,416
I did get a missed call from Indonesia

385
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,666
at 1:15 in the morning.

386
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,833
That was because of the time difference.

387
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,625
So are you telling me
that, um, in paradise,

388
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,500
on a fucking amazing remote beach,

389
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,833
watching the sunrise,

390
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,666
you thought about me, Dani?

391
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,458
So much.

392
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,166
About Sundays when they turned
the lights on in the disco

393
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,583
and our feet were stuck to the floor?

394
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,833
Is that what you missed
while you were in paradise?

395
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,625
Well...

396
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,291
Well, that sucks.

397
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:48,041
Because now I don't know what to do.

398
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:54,250
I came here and I swear to you I thought,
"I'll go for it, I don't care."

399
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,541
Because you can't waste your life
wishing you were with someone.

400
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,708
But then I saw you,
and I said, "Uh, Mm-mm. No."

401
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:05,041
"Stop, Julia, because it's best
if you don't."

402
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,500
And now you tell me this and...

403
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,291
I don't know what to do.

404
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:14,875
You're leaving me with this,
with all this responsibility.

405
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,416
What responsibility?

406
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,583
Of pulling away.

407
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,916
<i>Denver, Manila,
the surgeons are here.</i>

408
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,833
<i>Go open the door
and bring them over to treat the wounded.</i>

409
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,166
- <i>Denver</i>.
- Coming!

410
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,125
On my way.

411
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,375
Hey, it's no big deal.

412
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
No big deal.

413
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:56,708
No big deal.

414
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,500
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

415
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,208
Let me tell you something,
this time as a mother.

416
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:23,541
You were wrong to give up your life
in Thailand to steal a country's gold.

417
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,125
You know why?

418
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:29,541
Because at the end of the day, you're not
gonna miss the thrill of being a criminal,

419
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,875
but you'll miss the comfort of a family.

420
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,041
Think about it.

421
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:51,458
Okay, so this is Emilio,
the oldest, he lives in Venezuela.

422
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,458
This one's Julián,
he lives in Mexico City.

423
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:55,375
He calls me "<i>güey</i>."

424
00:33:56,916 --> 00:34:00,500
Now Hanna, a violinist.
Beautiful, right? She's in Finland.

425
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,750
This is Drazen, this guy's in Montenegro.

426
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,291
When I call to wish him a happy birthday,
he says, "Much obliged, sir."

427
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,375
This one's Ivanna.

428
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:11,041
She's got a temper,
but she's a great artist.

429
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,750
A blonde girl,
a Black boy, a redhead...

430
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,333
I would say that
they're all from different parents,

431
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,916
but I guess they must
take after their mothers.

432
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,708
Here comes the foreman.

433
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,041
- Huh.
- Yup.

434
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,333
Emil Enberg,
foreman in charge of the platform.

435
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,833
Alberto Mendoza,
engineer, and his assistant.

436
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:33,958
Good to meet you.

437
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,125
Delight to meet you.
I just check the extraction pump.

438
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,875
Would you mind if I switched to Spanish
for the technicalities?

439
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:40,791
Sure.

440
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:46,416
We've sabotaged
this priceless pump to get it out of here.

441
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,083
Tell him we're going to steal it from him.

442
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:53,208
Well, seemingly,
it's about impelling capacity of the pump.

443
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,875
The axle, seal, and bearing
have been damaged.

444
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,750
It's impossible to repair it here.

445
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,833
It needs to be transported
to the mainland. I'm so sorry.

446
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:04,791
Tell him that we're also
taking this gentleman here with us.

447
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:09,250
He spends so much time alone underwater,
breathing a mix of oxygen and helium,

448
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,583
that he's realized his wallet is full

449
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,208
of photos of the seven families
he hasn't had.

450
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,750
His children call him "<i>güey</i>" and "sir"
because nobody calls a stranger "Dad."

451
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,041
That's why he wants
to get involved in our heist,

452
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,791
to see if he can have a family
that isn't just on photo paper.

453
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,000
By the way,
tell the foreman we charge 50% up front.

454
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,750
He's going to have to pay us
to rob him. Translate, sir.

455
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,416
Well,
he's giving some instructions

456
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,625
about the sea transport to Stavanger,

457
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,208
we should cover the cost in advance.

458
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,916
But in eight days,
you'll have the pump back here.

459
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:49,666
Of course.

460
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,541
This guy is awesome.
Ask him if he has a sister.

461
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,625
Backpacks on the conveyor belt.
You, that way. Now.

462
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,083
Move.

463
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,208
Go on.

464
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,541
Double open fracture
of the radius and ulna.

465
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:09,208
He's got a bullet wound in the lower third
of the leg, with no exit.

466
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,458
And a puncture hemorrhage to the torso.

467
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,541
All yours, Doctor.

468
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,546
Here's the second man
to operate on.

469
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,201
My leg is crushed.

470
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,583
Femoral fracture and displaced patella.

471
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,708
Probably the tibia and the fibula
are shattered as well,

472
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,375
with femoral torsion.

473
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,291
And a possible tear, not too big.

474
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,500
We controlled the hemorrhage
by compressing it.

475
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,125
It's a disaster.

476
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,333
Hope your hands are steady, Doctor.

477
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,291
But he goes first.

478
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,458
Colonel, something's happening.

479
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:55,083
They're sending information from the bank.
It's a real-time video, a livestream.

480
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,125
I don't care how, just block.

481
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,583
I can't, I block one signal
then hundreds come up.

482
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,833
Then I want to see it.
Put it on the screen.

483
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:08,208
<i>We're recording this video
to make an important announcement.</i>

484
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,000
<i>Today, seven people have died</i>

485
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,916
<i>inside the Bank of Spain.</i>

486
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,250
What?

487
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,291
<i>Six soldiers and Silene Oliveira,</i>

488
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,250
<i>Tokyo.</i>

489
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,833
- No...
- No.

490
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,333
<i>A few years ago,</i>

491
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,416
<i>I used to think that Tokyo was a person</i>

492
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,375
<i>incapable of self-reflection.
She hurt people.</i>

493
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,625
<i>I thought she was a killer,
that she had no feelings.</i>

494
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,750
And then, I got to know her.

495
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,666
I remember I slapped her once.

496
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,250
We were on a beach and, uh,

497
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,583
she didn't trust me.

498
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,708
And I thought that her idea...

499
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,250
of rescuing Aníbal Cortés

500
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,583
was nothing but an impulse
of a spoiled girl...

501
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,625
who was feeling guilty.

502
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,458
Then I realized...

503
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:12,500
she was doing it out of love.

504
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,083
Very few people in this world

505
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,291
<i>are capable of braving the impossible
to save someone.</i>

506
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,416
<i>Today, I know</i>

507
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,583
that we've failed.

508
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,208
<i>I'm hurt by the loss of these lives.</i>

509
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,916
<i>And I ask you for your forgiveness,
on behalf of all of us,</i>

510
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,208
for having turned a rescue...

511
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,500
into a war with casualties.

512
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,125
From today on,

513
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,250
we're no longer worthy of being followed,

514
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,333
cheered on,

515
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
or applauded.

516
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,208
It's likely that
we're not getting out of here.

517
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:07,375
<i>So we ask that all those people
who believed in us,</i>

518
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:11,000
<i>that great red tide that's supporting us
outside the doors of the bank,</i>

519
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,458
<i>to please go home.</i>

520
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,958
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving!

521
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,166
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

522
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,291
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

523
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:33,708
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

524
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,458
We're not leaving!

525
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,750
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving!

526
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:47,500
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

527
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:52,666
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

528
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,750
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

529
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:02,000
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

530
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:05,250
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

531
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,833
They beat us to it, that fucking bitch!

532
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,333
The first to tell the story
is the one telling the truth.

533
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,166
Now if we go out there
with our Christmas annihilation story,

534
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,000
it'll be as useful as a pile of shit!

535
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:22,041
She beat us, the fucking crybaby
with her manipulative sentimentality.

536
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,291
With one small difference.

537
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,458
She actually believed what she was saying.

538
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,291
Consuelo, what's wrong?

539
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,666
The surgeon just told me that...

540
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,750
Arturo is alive.

541
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,125
I'm thrilled.

542
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:26,916
I crashed.

543
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,291
I thought that was it for me.

544
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:35,000
But I'm here, I'm back.

545
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,875
- I don't know what you...
- Wait.

546
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:38,958
Okay.

547
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,458
A moment ago, up there...

548
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,083
you were on the verge of dying.

549
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:59,333
And I can't even begin to imagine what
it'd be like to live without you, Denver.

550
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,125
I can't.

551
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,333
It felt like knives inside of me.

552
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:09,833
And I don't know.

553
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,041
I don't know
if we'll make it out of here, but...

554
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:19,791
if anything happens, Denver,
I don't want it to be while we're angry,

555
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,125
or distant, or doubtful,
because I have no doubts.

556
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,250
I love you.

557
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,583
I love you too, a lot.

558
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,250
I know.

559
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,458
And nothing could possibly
be more important.

560
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,833
Plus...

561
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,875
you and I both know
it's possible to love during a heist.

562
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,583
I fell in love during one.

563
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,125
Consuelo?

564
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,083
Consuelo, it's me.

565
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:42,791
Consuelo?

566
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:56,625
We've been waiting for you.

567
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,250
I really love your home.

568
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,125
Are you okay?

569
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,833
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Shh! No swear words.

570
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:10,375
At this age, they're like little sponges.
I don't want you traumatizing her.

571
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,833
So, good vibes only. Just smile.

572
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,625
Touch one hair on my wife's head
and I'll wipe you off the earth.

573
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,458
You're threatening me? Really?

574
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,583
The coward who didn't
send reinforcements to the Bank of Spain

575
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,708
because the Professor
had him by the cojones?

576
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,958
I don't know where you got that false
information from, but it's not true.

577
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,291
I was there, in the lion's den,

578
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:32,000
listening to him blackmail you
with some recordings.

579
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,416
Let's just talk about that in private,
if you don't mind.

580
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,500
I'm sure your wife is well aware
of how disgusting you are.

581
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,250
Okay.

582
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,375
Where is the Professor?

583
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,583
Ta-da!

584
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,833
"What are you wearing, Colonel?"

585
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,500
He's in my power.

586
00:45:57,291 --> 00:46:00,333
I could put a little ribbon on him
right now and hand him over to you.

587
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,791
What do you want in exchange?

588
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,375
You shut your fucking mouth.

589
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,791
I want you to publicly take back
all the defamation you said about me.

590
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:45,541
Resign from your position
and assume full responsibility.

591
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:46,625
As is your duty.

592
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:52,041
And then you deliver
the Professor on a silver platter.

593
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,791
Like a hero.

594
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,500
For this great service to the nation.

595
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,958
And what if I don't fucking feel like it?

596
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,833
If you don't fucking feel like it,
I'll pull a Raquel Murillo.

597
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,291
I'll switch sides, with all that entails.

598
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:21,208
I'll run away with the Professor.
We'll drink some caipirinhas.

599
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,458
Assuming you have the Professor
and hand him over to me, which I doubt,

600
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:42,000
you really think I'd incriminate myself,
go to trial, and get thrown in jail

601
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:45,166
just so this man doesn't get his way?
No, Alicia. Come on.

602
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,083
I'd rather we're both free
than both in jail, don't you agree?

603
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,006
I'm even starting to like him,
for fuck's sake.

604
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,791
It's a figure of speech, honey.

605
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,958
The real dilemma here is this.

606
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,416
Either you go ahead
and you shoot me right now

607
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,166
and don't get out of jail
until your son's balls are shriveled...

608
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,083
She's a girl, you piece of shit.

609
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,875
...or you give me the gun
and maybe you get a reduced sentence,

610
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:08,041
because about... three minutes ago,

611
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,416
I hit the panic button
on the alarm for this house,

612
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,041
and the police are about to burst through
that goddamn door!

613
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,750
LÓPEZ DE ORGAZ STREET

614
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,041
Oh!

615
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,875
3 LÓPEZ DE ORGAZ ST.

616
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,250
Tamayo.

617
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:56,125
Shut up.

618
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:18,791
<i>Who is it?</i>

619
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:22,416
Hi. Good afternoon, ma'am. Listen, I have
a registered letter for 5C, Mr. Tamayo.

620
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,750
Would you be so kind as to open the door
so I can leave him the notice? Thank you.

621
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,375
<i>Vamos, vamos, vamos.</i>

622
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,559
- Come on!
- Keep going!

623
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,500
I told you.
Now you have no choice but to trust me.

624
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,230
- Let's go, move it!
- Yes?

625
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,333
Ma'am, can I give you
the notice for Mr. Tamayo?

626
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:12,416
One second.
