<i>he was only prolonging his suffering,</i>

26
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,625
<i>he still chose to fight.</i>

27
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,750
Marseille, turn on the GPS.
Find the signal for the trucks.

28
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,791
They don't know they're geolocated.

29
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,250
Palermo, Lisbon, private line.

30
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,250
They're four kilometers from here.
Looks like they've stopped.

31
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,958
Darko, at the next crossroads,
everyone go west.

32
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,375
Copy, Professor.

33
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,791
Weapons ready,
they're four kilometers away.

34
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,833
Lisbon, do you copy me?

35
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,666
Come on, Lisbon, answer.

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,333
This is Lisbon.
I'm with Palermo. Talk to me.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Someone stole the gold.

38
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,666
What did you say?

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,583
They came in dressed as police officers
while all the gold was in the trucks.

40
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,958
<i>They tied us up and took everything.</i>

41
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,541
- How many were there?
- Ten.

42
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,708
Wait a minute, Sergio.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

43
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,125
They went in just after
you got all the gold in the trucks,

44
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,125
right before leaving?

45
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,125
- <i>That's when they went in?</i>
- Yes.

46
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,416
You know why that's significant?
We have a mole.

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
It's an abandoned quarry.
They're still stopped.

48
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,583
They're probably unloading the gold.

49
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,875
Darko, they're in the old quarry
in Santa Bárbara.

50
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,750
No! No!

51
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,458
- Fuck!
- Palermo.

52
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,708
You know this bank better than anyone.
Tell me there's another way to get out.

53
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,750
Without the gold, we're finished, Lisbon.

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,166
Then I guess we're finished.

55
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,125
There they are.

56
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,958
Take it slow.

57
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,708
Darko, we're getting out.

58
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,625
Cover the sides.

59
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,125
Marseille, let's check the trucks.

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,000
Everyone else, cover us.
They could be anywhere.

61
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,916
Let's go.

62
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,458
Psst. Cover them.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,666
You guys, right here. Eyes on the car.

64
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,708
Fucking hell!

65
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,291
No!

66
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,291
The trucks are empty.

67
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,083
<i>They unloaded 90 tons of gold
in half an hour.</i>

68
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,500
It's not improvised. They knew the plan.

69
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,875
In that case, there's only one person.

70
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,083
And you know
perfectly well who it was.

71
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,375
No, no, no, no. She knew the objective,

72
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,498
but she didn't know
how we were getting the gold out

73
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,416
or... or any details about the plan.

74
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,541
You put everything away
in the safe every night.

75
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,458
Sergio, your brother was in love.

76
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,101
Do you really think that a piece of paper
with our strategy on it

77
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,000
was more important than love for him?

78
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,041
Well, yes. All our lives depended on it,
so of course I do!

79
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,041
People talk in bed, Sergio.

80
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,708
<i>Including you.</i>

81
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,375
You told me about Plan Paris while in bed,
because you knew no one could hear us.

82
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,625
<i>You knew you were putting
everyone's lives in danger to save me.</i>

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,291
We both knew
they would come in after that.

84
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,875
And now Tokyo is dead.

85
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,875
<i>That's what people do. They open up in bed</i>

86
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,000
<i>and reveal secrets
that put other people's lives in danger.</i>

87
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,250
Your brother did that,

88
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,625
you did it,

89
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,416
and so did I.

90
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,375
Hey! Psst!

91
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,583
Sergio.

92
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,666
Quick question for you.

93
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,458
Who the fuck are you talking about?

94
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,041
About my brother's ex-wife.

95
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,500
Mm. Awesome. And what does she do?

96
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,916
She's a pianist.

97
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,000
And she's a thief!

98
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,250
Ah!

99
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,833
She knew everything.
She knew everything.

100
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,791
She knew everything!

101
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,875
All this time, they've been sleeping here
down there while they watched us.

102
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,583
They saw everything.

103
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,416
All they had to do was time us.

104
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,250
They knew that once the trucks got in,

105
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,666
we'd take around eight to ten hours
to get them ready to leave again, and...

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,083
That's why they got there just in time.

107
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,333
Come on, come on, come on, guys!

108
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,416
We don't have all day!

109
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,666
Let's go! Let's go!

110
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,041
All right,
that's good. That's good.

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,708
- Eight minutes. That's all we have.
- Come on. Go, go, go!

112
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,375
- Let's go! Over there.
- All right!

113
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,791
- Let's go!
- Come on!

114
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,211
<i>This is a message
for the whole gang.</i>

115
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,916
<i>The gold's been stolen.</i>

116
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>They came into the stormwater tank
pretending to be police officers.</i>

117
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,000
<i>We're going after them.</i>

118
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,916
We're currently looking
for several dump trucks.

119
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,750
They loaded them with the gold bars
and then covered everything with dirt.

120
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,125
<i>They're driving with the cargo uncovered
to avoid suspicion.</i>

121
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,083
It's crucial no one finds out
the gold was stolen.

122
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,291
<i>Not the hostages, not the police, no one.</i>

123
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,791
<i>In case of a setback,
that would be the end of us.</i>

124
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,625
- <i>Is that clear?</i>
- It's clear.

125
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,708
Copy that.

126
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,291
- Helsinki?
- I understand.

127
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,000
- <i>Manila?</i>
- Copy that.

128
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,333
Denver? Stockholm?

129
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,250
Denver, Stockholm, do you copy me?

130
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,500
Rio, listen to me.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,958
I need you to hack into
all the traffic cameras

132
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,250
near the Santa Bárbara quarry, you got it?

133
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,458
Marseille, go to the stormwater tank.

134
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,381
Take two miners,
the Captain, and those trucks.

135
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,791
When you get there, get rid of
the police vans and launch Plan Tom Thumb.

136
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,458
Copy that. Captain, Polish guy,
and you, let's go. Get in the trucks.

137
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,166
And everyone else,

138
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,083
before a crisis occurs
and everyone starts wondering

139
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,916
<i>what degree they wanna earn
inside a maximum-security prison.</i>

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,166
<i>I give you my word.</i>

141
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,916
We're going to recover the gold,

142
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,250
and we're gonna get you out of there.

143
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,916
<i>That was the first time
the Professor said something</i>

144
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,250
<i>and nobody believed him.</i>

That's how it's done.

Who was it?

157
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,750
Who was the funny guy, or funny girl,

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,916
who put this fish inside my bed?

159
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,250
Very well, very well. Very well.

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,125
You know what?

161
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,375
Holy shit!

162
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,708
I resign as the brains behind the gang.

163
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,791
I'd much rather be partying.
Give me the <i>patxarán</i>.

164
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,416
Uh, it's more amaretto than <i>patxarán</i>...

165
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,583
Just give it to me, shut up, who cares!

166
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,291
Ah, there you go.
There you go, there you go.

167
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,208
- Okay, now I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.
- Sure, why not?

168
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,416
Do you know why you're here?

169
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,375
You're here because you need
to turn a valve, let off steam.

170
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,833
You're concentrating all day.

171
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,125
Concentrating all day
is really tough, right?

172
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,767
It's exhausting, isn't it?

173
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,267
You understand this little party
you've organized is a symptom,

174
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,583
a symptom of weakness?

175
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,541
It shows you don't have what it takes
to be focused all day like me.

176
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,208
The only responsible one is Nairobi.
You have to be on guard all day.

177
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,708
The whole day on guard.

178
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,375
You have to be on guard all day,

179
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,958
clenching your fists,
squeezing your fists, Bogotá.

180
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,583
Tokyo, Helsinki, you have to keep
your... your butt as tight as a drum.

181
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,541
That's what you have to do.
Understand, Denver?

182
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:15,458
Keep your eyes open, like an owl.
Stiff, vigilant, because they'll get you.

183
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,181
As soon as you lower your guard a little.

184
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,890
Any son of a bitch, any bastard out there

185
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,625
who's actually spending
their entire day being alert,

186
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,833
they will get you.

187
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,416
- Relax...
- No!

188
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,750
You need an escape valve? Okay.

189
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,625
Then here it is.

190
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,583
Let's all relax.

191
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,625
Let's all just relax. Okay.

<i>The day the gang fell,</i>

215
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,166
<i>we all thought about
the night of the fish.</i>

216
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:43,000
<i>But this time, we didn't lower our guard
to let off steam.</i>

217
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,208
<i>It was out of despair
from having lost the gold,</i>

218
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,166
<i>and along with the gold,
we lost something worse,</i>

219
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,166
<i>confidence in our leader.</i>

220
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,166
<i>So it was hard to stay alert
and realize that the real danger...</i>

221
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,250
<i>was inside with us</i>

222
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,500
<i>from the very moment
we thought we had subdued Sagasta.</i>

223
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,458
We came in here
to complete a mission,

224
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,041
put an end to this heist,
and that's what we're gonna do.

225
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,875
There's two of you including the psycho.

226
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,875
<i>Right now, this isn't even a possibility.</i>

227
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,125
You're mistaken,

228
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,333
because this time
they won't see it coming.

229
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,583
<i>All we need
is one person to end all of this.</i>

230
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,375
Listen to me.

231
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,833
<i>I want you to go through
the ventilation ducts,</i>

232
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,125
<i>but you're not gonna act.</i>

233
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,916
<i>Even if you see three of them
sound asleep right in front of you</i>

234
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,041
<i>and have a good chance to kill them,</i>

235
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,708
<i>use restraint.</i>

236
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,041
I'm at the main entrance.

237
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,375
- Situation?
- There's four charges.

238
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,041
<i>You have to move like a ghost.
We'll buy you time.</i>

239
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,166
And I'll negotiate with them
so we can get surgeons to come in

240
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,291
and operate on Ramiro.

241
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,625
<i>You'll communicate
with the command post by radio.</i>

242
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,750
<i>And the doctors they send in
should be soldiers</i>

243
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,458
<i>so they can take part
in the undercover operation.</i>

244
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,000
<i>What's the mission?</i>

245
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,458
To open this fucking building.

246
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,125
They feel powerful locked up in here.

247
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,791
But there's less than ten of them
and the whole army's out there.

248
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,750
<i>You're gonna open three fronts.</i>

249
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,583
<i>The loading docks,</i>

250
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,833
<i>the large windows on the first floor,</i>

251
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,416
<i>and, most importantly, the main entrance.</i>

252
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,791
Once you've done that,
we will have won this war.

253
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,250
In less than ten minutes,
they'll take control of the bank.

254
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,333
And what about you?

255
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,958
You, me, and Ramiro,
as well as the surgeons,

256
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,208
we'll be the Trojan horse.

257
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,416
The main entrance is clear.

258
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,583
Good job, Arteche.
We'll wait for your signal.

259
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,458
Well...

260
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,500
With all that confusion
you were feeling, um...

261
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,416
about your past, you,
Manila, I don't know.

262
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,541
You seemed pretty involved.

263
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,125
What do you mean "involved"?

264
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,041
Um, like very eager, very passionate...

265
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,875
It was too much, right?

266
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,750
I overdid it. I... I knew should've been
more delicate, but with the...

267
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,083
with the striptease and all, well,
you didn't make it easy, right?

268
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,541
Did you like it? Was it good?

269
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,666
Fuck yeah.

270
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,375
Well, tell me.

271
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,416
How are you feeling?

272
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,958
Well, things are clearer now.

273
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,291
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

274
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,791
Yeah,

275
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,416
because before having an orgasm, you...
Well, there's a lot of noise in your head.

276
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,000
But once you ejaculate,
only one of two things can happen,

277
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,500
either you want to get
the hell out of there, or...

278
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,416
or you wanna be with that person
for the rest of your life.

279
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,291
And? What do you want to do?

280
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,791
I want to stay here,

281
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,791
with you,

282
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,458
holding you for the rest of my life.

283
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,041
If you want to, of course.

284
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,375
But under one condition.

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

286
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,166
The next time you feel like going out,

287
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,791
don't lie to me.

288
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,583
You'll take me with you
to party until the sun rises.

289
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,125
- Or until it sets again.
- Sure.

290
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,125
Fuck, can't you knock?
What the hell's wrong with you?

291
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,750
Someone stole the gold.

292
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,708
What?

293
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,833
Absolutely not a word about this.

294
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,125
If anyone finds out,
it's over, we're dead.

295
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,625
Son of a bitch.

296
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,666
Come on, let's go! Quick!

297
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,583
Let's go.

298
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,958
Shakir,
I just got access to the server.

299
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,375
I'm in, Professor.
We have the traffic cameras.

300
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,750
All right, check the ones on the M60.

301
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,458
<i>They must have taken
the exit at kilometer 26.</i>

302
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,541
Here it is. Exit 26, Madrid-Barcelona.

303
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:18,708
We're looking for three dump trucks,
maybe four, between 10:55 and 11:10.

304
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,291
<i>I don't see
any dump trucks taking that exit.</i>

305
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,250
<i>Look for
any heavy goods vehicle.</i>

306
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,000
Nothing, Professor.

307
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,708
There's nothing here,
not in those 15 minutes, or the next 15.

308
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,208
They took a local road.
There's no cameras on those.

309
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,750
<i>Any idiot knows that.</i>

310
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,393
- Then there's no way we can find them.
- No, we still have time.

311
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,166
All we can do
is take care of the people outside.

312
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,083
Cincinnati, my daughter, and my mom.

313
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,083
I won't give up now.
I won't throw in the towel.

314
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,625
You already did.
When you put your hands down.

315
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,000
You had weapons, men,
a strong position, and you surrendered.

316
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,125
It was a lost battle.

317
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,625
<i>They came in with patrol cars,</i>

318
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,541
special operation vans.
It looked like an advanced party.

319
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,750
Killing 20 police officers
wouldn't have saved us.

320
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,291
They weren't police officers!

321
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,708
It was a fucking illusionist's act,
and you fell for it.

322
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,250
You fell for the same tricks,
the same illusions that you use!

323
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,500
Shut up!

324
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,083
Wait a minute.

325
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,958
<i>It's like Palermo said.</i>

326
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,000
This is the son of Berlin.

327
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,625
They're playing the same cards we are.

328
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,666
Lisbon was right.

329
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,625
Of course it's an act of illusionism.

330
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,767
<i>It was the case when they stole our gold.
And that's still the case right now.</i>

331
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,250
They knew we would check
the security cameras.

332
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,833
It was the only thing we could do.

333
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,375
And that we would believe what we saw.

334
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,041
But maybe what we're seeing isn't real.

335
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,041
Rio, check those videos again.

336
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,541
<i>Look for something, a loop,</i>

337
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,083
whatever, for any signs that those videos
may have been tampered with.

338
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,625
The asphalt. It's wet.
It didn't rain today, that's yesterday.

339
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
They altered the video even though
they could've went on a local road

340
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,958
<i>that doesn't have any cameras.</i>

341
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,721
Why would they go through
all that trouble?

342
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,958
Because they need to.

343
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,041
Exactly.

344
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:19,041
They're going somewhere
they can only get to on this road.

345
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,916
The M60 is a ring road.
They'd never use it to get out of Madrid.

346
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,500
Because they're not running away.

347
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,333
That means they're hiding.

348
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,541
No one's gonna leave the country
with 90 tons of gold.

349
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,416
What do you do when you have
so much money and so much gold

350
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,780
that you can't take it with you?

351
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,433
What did Pablo Escobar do?

352
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,166
- What did pirates do?
- They bury it!

353
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
That's why they're using dump trucks.

354
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,916
- That's right.
- The gold is underground.

355
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,916
- Correct!
- Where do you bury that kind of treasure?

356
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,750
Wherever it is, they're burying it.

357
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,583
The hole you need to make
to bury 90 tons of gold

358
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,833
requires you to move around
so much earth and so much machinery...

359
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,541
that we might still have
a chance of finding it.

360
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,375
Okay, higher.

361
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,166
Higher, higher.

362
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,666
Attention!

363
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,791
I want everyone dressed
as anything but a soldier.

364
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,125
A doctor, a civil safety officer,
ambulance driver, whatever.

365
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,416
We're going in when they least expect it.

366
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,500
We'll approach the bank under camouflage,
we'll gather troops in the blind spots,

367
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,583
and then we'll wait
for a signal from Sergeant Arteche.

368
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,416
- Is that clear?
<i>- Sí, señor!</i>

369
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,125
Go get 'em!

370
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,625
Let's go, let's go!

371
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,250
I'm almost at the library.

372
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,458
I'm about to establish contact
with Major Sagasta.

373
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,541
Copy that, Sergeant.

374
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,208
<i>All units get in position.</i>

375
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,500
<i>Suárez,
keep your men in the blind spots.</i>

376
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,625
Copy that, Colonel.

377
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,250
<i>Cañizo, wait for my order.</i>

378
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,625
<i>I've made
visual contact with Sagasta.</i>

379
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,833
Mendizábal, status?

380
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:51,541
- We're now in position, Colonel.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

381
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,708
We're moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

382
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,791
Suárez, get ready.

383
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,500
Standing by at the blind spot.

384
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,916
- Cañizo?
- Colonel, our unit is set.

385
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,625
Sergeant, all units are ready
and awaiting your signal.

386
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,583
Keep your eyes on the ground!

387
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,833
There's nothing to see here.

388
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,583
<i>Arteche.</i>

389
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,500
Arteche, what's going on?

390
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:30,434
- Another robber just came in.
- Put your heads down.

391
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:31,541
<i>Stand by.</i>

392
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,750
How's that leg feeling?

393
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,000
Good. I still don't feel anything.

394
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,583
The hostages giving you trouble?

395
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:41,666
No.

396
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,500
They've been quiet.

397
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,791
I came to tell you something.

398
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,791
This kind of sounds like a goodbye.

399
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:56,625
The Professor lost the gold,
and I really doubt we'll get out of here.

400
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,583
Palermo, you'll get me out of here.

401
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,083
You promised.

402
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,125
And you'll do it.

403
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:06,958
Maybe you doubt it,

404
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,708
but I don't.

405
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,708
Wow.
I wish I had your confidence.

406
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What's going on?

407
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,791
<i>Initiating phase two.</i>

408
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,000
You gotta untie us.
He needs medical attention.

409
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,458
- Please, please!
- All right, everyone stay there.

410
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,083
Hostages, get down! Hostages, down!

411
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,708
Get down or I'll shoot you!

412
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:51,916
Okay, let's see.

413
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,916
Stick your tongue out!

414
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,856
- <i>I'm in.</i>
- Units on alert.

415
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,291
Sergeant Arteche is going in.

416
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,875
Listen to me. It's not epilepsy, okay?
It might be brain damage.

417
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,458
Possibly a subdural hematoma.

418
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,541
We need to help him,
and we need to do it now.

419
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,559
- You gotta untie us.
- Untie the doctors, dammit!

420
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,583
- He's dying, for God's sake!
- Shut up, Major!

421
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,041
Come over here very slowly.

422
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:19,958
You too.

423
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,375
One wrong move
and I'll blow your fucking head off!

424
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,406
Helsinki, shoot them!

425
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,418
If you shoot,
I'll blow your boyfriend's head off.

426
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,833
- You have a fucking machine gun! Shoot!
- Drop the weapon.

427
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,500
I'd love to kill him.

428
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,208
So just give me an excuse.

429
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,375
Come on. Five...

430
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,583
- Four, three, two...
- Shoot them, dammit! Shoot them!

431
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,375
One!

432
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,291
Drop the fucking weapon.

433
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,041
Sergeant, do you copy?

434
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,165
<i>Library cleared.</i>

435
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,666
Major Sagasta is operational
and in charge of Trojan horse.

436
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,291
Colonel.

437
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,583

<i>Afternoon, Professor.
This is Colonel Tamayo.</i>

492
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:01,000
<i>You're probably surprised that
I'm talking to you from your gang's radio,</i>

493
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:04,291
but I regret to inform you this is not
like one of your little tricks.

494
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,333
If you want confirmation, just listen.

495
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,333
Sergio, don't worry.
We're all alive, but on our knees.

496
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,333
<i>They deactivated the charges
and snuck in through the back.</i>

497
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,041
And if you need visual confirmation,

498
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:26,083
<i>just turn on the TV,
because they're gonna start coming out.</i>

499
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,666
One by one, the whole band.

500
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,333
Like the Rolling Stones.

501
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,541
So I recommend you start looking for

502
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,083
the deepest, darkest hole
you can use to hide

503
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,416
because we're coming for ya.

504
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,458
There's no need, Tamayo.

505
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,291
I'm turning myself in.

506
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,791
<i>I don't think it's 100% clear
why I'm outside the bank.</i>

507
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,875
<i>Not even to everyone in the gang.</i>

508
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,750
Some people think
it's because I'm a coward.

509
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,875
Because if something went wrong,

510
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,125
I'd be safe, not them.

511
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,583
<i>But I promised myself
that if the gang went down...</i>

512
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,708
I'd go down too.

513
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,708
You've already won this game, Tamayo.

514
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:12,875
<i>So it makes no sense
for us to keep dragging this out</i>

515
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,250
<i>with another chase
risking injury to more people.</i>

516
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,833
I'm asking you...

517
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,916
between gentlemen,
to accept my surrender and...

518
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
No!

519
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,666
<i>And allow me to go to the bank</i>

520
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,958
so I can go out in handcuffs
with my partners.

521
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,809
<i>I'll be there in 20 minutes, that way
you'll have everyone in the photos.</i>

522
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,291
Okay, make that 15 minutes instead of 20.

523
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,041
What do you mean you'll surrender?

524
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,166
Yeah.

525
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,875
This is Colonel Tamayo.

526
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:47,458
We're keeping the hostages in the library.
Don't let them get out of there.

527
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,125
Nobody gets out! Understood?

528
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,333
What are you trying to do?
Be a hero? Or be a martyr?

529
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,583
Listen to me.
If the gang leaves the bank, it's over.

530
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,000
Everything would be lost.

531
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,791
There'd be no turning back. But right now...

532
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,375
Right now, we still have a chance.

533
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,416
One in a million,
but we might still have it.

534
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,583
A chance to do what? A chance to do what?

535
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,458
I need you to find the gold.

536
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,958
- What?
- With Benjamín.

537
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,750
- What?
- I need you to find the gold.

538
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,416
Now. Right now.

539
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,625
I need you to find the gold.

540
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,458
Jesus Christ.

541
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,458
Jesus Christ.

542
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:30,017
- Alicia, listen...
- Did you hear that, Logroño?

543
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,416
Now it turns out that you and I,
a new mother and an ex-convict,

544
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,916
are in charge of delivering
the final blow, the checkmate,

545
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,041
the master move.

546
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,125
Are you fucking high?

547
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,041
If there's anyone who can do it, it's you.

548
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,791
I am a woman who just had a baby girl
and I'm breastfeeding.

549
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,291
I'm absolutely exhausted.
I'm tired, very tired.

550
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,791
And I don't know... I don't know
if I can deal with a war

551
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,500
between organized crime families.

552
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,125
- I don't know.
- All you have to do is find some robbers.

553
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,833
That's what you've been doing
your whole life. You're the best.

554
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,708
- Stop buttering me up, Sergio.
- You found me.

555
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,541
And I'm the most wanted man
in all of Spain.

556
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,583
Alicia, Interpol was
looking for me for months.

557
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,916
They looked all over the planet.

558
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,208
They didn't find me. You did.

559
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,291
In hours.

560
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,291
You snuck out
of a press conference full of journalists.

561
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,083
You ran away from Tamayo,
from the entire police force,

562
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,625
while you were nine months pregnant
and you found me!

563
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,666
Of course you're going to find that gold!

564
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,833
So take those cars and this gang...

565
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,250
and go find the biggest loot in history.

566
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,583
Alicia. Come.

567
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,666
Consider yourself lucky, Professor.

568
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,291
That's the first time
I've given someone a real hug

569
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,875
since Germán died.

570
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:19,916
But more importantly,

571
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,333
it's the first time something
made me smile. <i>Really</i> smile.

572
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,625
May I ask you what did it?

573
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,000
Maybe because you're
leaving me with Columbo...

574
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,291
and Starsky and Hutch and their friends.

575
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,500
They're the best.

576
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:36,916
Yeah.

577
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,125
And I need you to do me one last favor.

578
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,250
I can't take any of our cars,

579
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,333
they're connected and geolocalized,
but that one...

580
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:07,625
You better go.

581
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,708
Gentlemen, let's go.

582
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,125
Professor, when you see
my daughter, tell her...

583
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,958
that I love her very much.

584
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,666
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Aren't you the Professor?

585
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,750
That's right.

586
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,541
You have a beautiful car.

587
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,458
Come on, push this open.

588
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,625
Jesus Christ.

589
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:10,583
They've cleaned it all out, Colonel.

590
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,250
They took the entire national reserve.

591
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,625
Do you understand what that means?

592
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,208
It's a country's credit backbone.

593
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,125
Its solvency! Its collateral!

594
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,083
- Don't you understand?
- I understand, Mr. Mario. I understand.

595
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,208
- Cañizo.
- Colonel.

596
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:35,875
I want your men to fire intermittent
bursts at the ground every two minutes,

597
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:38,267
as if the robbers were still trying
to hold on to the bank.

598
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:39,125
Of course, sir.

599
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:42,666
Until we figure out what the fuck to say,
this operation continues.

600
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Cincinnati.

601
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,000
Son of a bitch, Cincinnati.
I have to go get him.

602
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,208
- All right, um... don't leave, okay?
- Okay.

603
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,833
- All right, I'ma go.
- Okay.

604
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,000
<i>♪ Just wanna talk to you ♪</i>

605
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:29,625
<i>♪ Let me talk to you... ♪</i>

606
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:37,708
In the end,

607
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:40,083
there's no one left
but the professionals of nightlife.

608
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,458
You and me.

609
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,291
Now <i>this </i>is the resistance.

610
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:52,333
- Exact... Exactly.
- Mm? Not... Not...

611
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,458
- That?
- Exactly.

612
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,375
No, this.

613
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,791
I love you a lot, Tokyo.

614
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,708
A lot.

615
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I love you too.

616
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:15,708
A lot.

617
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:19,708
You know why?

618
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,541
Because of my style and the way I dance?

619
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:23,458
Hm?

620
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,500
Because you always make it to the end.

621
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,208
That's why you're here
with me at eight in the morning.

622
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,375
Am I wrong? Am I?

623
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,041
No, it's true. It's true.

624
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,333
I realized that you're a hero.

625
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:51,791
The rest of us can mess around
and get wasted...

626
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,125
because you're on the other side,
holding the rope.

627
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:00,833
Yeah.

628
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,833
<i>We know
nothing can go wrong when you're here.</i>

629
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,833
You'll pull an ace from your sleeve.

630
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:35,416
You're the master of illusion.

631
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:44,625
That's why we go back into the lion's den.

632
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,500
<i>Even if they point a thousand guns at us.</i>

633
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,000
Because we all believe in you.

634
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,166
Like a mantra.

635
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,708
Professor! Professor!

636
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:16,666
You're our faith.

637
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,458
<i>The faith that, if all else fails,</i>

638
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,583
we still have you.

639
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:29,750
No matter how bad things get...

640
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,708
even if they have us on our knees,

641
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,041
even if it looks like there's no hope,
like we're almost dead...

642
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,666
we keep on believing.

643
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:47,416
Because we know
we'll always have the Professor.

644
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:51,208
<i>Professor! Professor!</i>
