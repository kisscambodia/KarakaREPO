1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,583
Good evening.

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,833
- Good evening, thank you.
- Good evening.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,791
Ah, wonderful.
They have lobster thermidor.

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,583
We'll eat like royalty tonight, my love.

5
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,500
Andrés, we need to talk.

6
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,541
I really don't like
the sound of that sentence at all.

7
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,425
It always comes
at the beginning of a breakup.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
I know.

9
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,875
I've tried to find
the best time to tell you,

10
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,875
but I don't think I ever will.

11
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,750
Don't tell me it's because of my illness.

12
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,375
Hey, my love.

13
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,208
My love,

14
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,791
see that's the best reason
for us to stay together.

15
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,583
Can't you see it?

16
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,000
We're not weighed down by
"For the rest of your life."

17
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,333
The burden of every relationship.

18
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,625
Our love is only about delight.

19
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,416
Because it's vibrant, light, fleeting.

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,583
And above all, hopeful. You know why?

21
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,208
Because loving a person
who's terminally ill

22
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,500
always opens the path to the next love.

23
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,916
Of course, it's...

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,083
It's like one of those marvelous trips
you take around Europe.

25
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,083
First, you go to Rome, then Vienna...

26
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:32,541
You don't like Vienna?
It's not a problem. Later comes Istanbul.

27
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,583
What if I tell you that's not it?

28
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,666
What if I tell you
that our relationship changed?

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,041
That we used to have big dreams.

30
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,833
We wanted to visit Greenland,
the northern lights. But...

31
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,416
after the vineyards in California

32
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,458
came Madrid.

33
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,750
And we haven't left.

34
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,750
You used to talk about
stealing the Spanish gold reserve.

35
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,458
But now we're just city hopping.
Doing what?

36
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,875
Stealing a couple diamonds here,

37
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,250
some Viking gold chalices there...

38
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,666
You always play your best cards
when you're trying to charm someone.

39
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,625
But it's not easy
keeping that flame alive.

40
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,875
So, you're asking for a divorce.

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,750
Yeah.

42
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,208
Have you decided on your order yet?

43
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,333
No, we haven't yet.

44
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,791
You don't need to fill her glass.
It seems I'll be having this wine alone.

45
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,541
There's just one thing
that I want you to tell me.

46
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,916
It's nothing, just one question. May I?

47
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,000
Who is he?

48
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,250
Don't make this any harder.

49
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,541
No, no. Come on, I can't believe it.

50
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,541
Is that the last thing
you're going to say to me?

51
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,958
Tatiana, all my life I've been
searching for the genuine

52
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,625
in every single moment,
in every decision I've made.

53
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,791
And now you're leaving me

54
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,291
with two of the most
overused sentences in movie history?

55
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,791
"We need to talk"
and "Don't make this any harder"?

56
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,708
Follow that car.

57
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,666
Stop. Stop here.

58
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:16,666
<i>♪ If I stay with you
If I'm choosing wrong ♪</i>

59
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,000
<i>♪ I don't care at all ♪</i>

60
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:26,333

66
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,916
We're running out of water.

67
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,791
This is the stormwater tank.

68
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,791
There's less water flowing.

69
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,208
That's it! The last pellets
just came out the pipes!

70
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,875
It's all out!

71
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,500
Colonel.

72
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,875
Besides the engine, it's like I'm hearing
a really strong suction noise.

73
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,250
What do you mean "suction"?
What the fuck are you talking about?

74
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,500
It's like a vacuum cleaner
sucking water out of a pipe, but massive.

75
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,833
They're extracting water. A lot of it.

76
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,125
No...

77
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,250
Play it again.
Clean the signal as much as possible.

78
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,208
It does sound like water being suctioned.

79
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,291
I'd say they've emptied
the secure gold vault.

80
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,708
So they got the gold out?

81
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,958
I don't know. It's possible.

82
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,833
You and the other engineer
told me it wasn't possible.

83
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,291
It wasn't possible
using the pump in the Bank of Spain.

84
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,500
It wouldn't have enough force
to get that gold out.

85
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,083
Unless maybe they reduced it
to the size of a particle.

86
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,000
Still, I don't think
they could get 90 tons out.

87
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,500
You don't know
what those bastards are capable of.

88
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,541
They're getting the fucking gold
out right now!

89
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,666
You have to tell me where! Figure it out!

90
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,458
<i>Professor?</i>

91
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,166
<i>Hey, you didn't tell us
it'd be so hard to get the gold out.</i>

92
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,625
<i>Hmm?</i>

93
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,375
I didn't tell you it'd be easy either.

94
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,125
<i>Otherwise, I'd stop looking like
the criminal mastermind</i>

95
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>you fell madly in love with.</i>

96
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,083
You're such an idiot.

97
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,333
<i>Over and out.</i>

98
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,833
Well, looks like we're about done, right?

99
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,625
Yeah.

100
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,458
When we get outta here...

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,458
I'm gonna buy a motorcycle,

102
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,750
and I'll get a custom-made seat
in the shape of my ass.

103
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,541
And I'll travel the world.

104
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,875
Mm-hmm. Very nice.

105
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,041
What do you prefer? Beach or pool?

106
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Beach?

107
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,041
Bikini or one-piece?

108
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,791
What is this, a quiz for a magazine?

109
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,333
I'm just... just talking.

110
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,875
But if you want, um, when we get out,

111
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,958
I'll treat you to a gin and tonic.

112
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,125
And we can finish the quiz.

113
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,708
<i>All the hugging wasn't
just a celebration of our triumph,</i>

114
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,875
<i>or a heartfelt tribute
to the ones we lost along the way.</i>

115
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,291
<i>It was the primal roar
of a handful of insignificant people</i>

116
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:30,708
<i>who had managed to get
90 tons of gold out through a pipe.</i>

117
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,416
<i>That accomplishment was
a message of hope to the world.</i>

118
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,333
<i>"There's nothing that's impossible."</i>

119
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,833
<i>But the heist wasn't over yet.</i>

120
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:47,916
<i>And all that hope would be essential
during the next few hours.</i>

121
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,541
<i>Because what we were about to face</i>

122
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,291
<i>was simply the most
severe reality check to date.</i>

123
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,125
I heard we managed to get the gold out.

124
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,166
I kissed Manila.

125
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,458
Honestly, that's not what matters most.

126
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,875
What matters most
is that I'm actually really confused.

127
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,541
I think I have way more in common
with her than with you.

128
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,416
You... You know
what I used to do in Indonesia?

129
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,875
I'd tell you that I was gonna go buy wood,
but I'd go partying for two days.

130
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,541
I'd lie about it because I had this
feeling that everything I wanted was bad.

131
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,250
I don't know.

132
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,750
And reconnecting with Manila,
it actually made me realize,

133
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,500
somehow, that what I am isn't bad.

134
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,166
You're not going to say anything?

135
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,541
To be honest,
I'd rather talk another time, Denver.

136
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,375
I've got an awful headache and...

137
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,708
I'd prefer to get some rest.

138
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,416
Alone.

139
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,875
Sure.

140
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,030
They're probably pumping it through
the stream channel that floods the vault.

141
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,208
All that water is then gathered
in two natural streams,

142
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,083
and after that, it's drained
into another stream in the south.

143
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,791
Those goddamn motherfuckers.

144
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,416
They weren't gonna get it out
through the drain or sewer.

145
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,041
They're pumping the gold farther away,
through that stream.

146
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,458
They must have brought in
a much more powerful pump.

147
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,833
<i>I mean, it's at least 25 km of pipelines
carrying 90 tons of gold.</i>

148
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,291
They'd probably need an oil pipeline pump.

149
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,958
Find Suárez. We need to
comb through that whole stream.

150
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,458
And get me the pipeline plans.

151
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,208
I want to know every single spot
those channels go through,

152
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,833
where they lead, everything.

153
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,916
Get a team. We're launching an offensive.

154
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,708
What now?

155
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,875
Well, now we take turns
keeping an eye on the outside,

156
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,583
we freshen up. How's that sound?

157
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,833
Then we wait for the Professor's magic.

158
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,625
Where do you think the gold is going?

159
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,041
These channels lead to several factories,
uh, treatment plants,

160
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,416
and hydraulic facilities,
to, uh, stormwater tanks...

161
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,833
We need to track it down!
Every single gram of it.

162
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,208
I want soldiers combing every
cubic centimeter of water in those pipes.

163
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,833
There were 5,000 soldiers
outside the Bank of Spain

164
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,333
and more on Operation Cage
to find the Professor.

165
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,916
- How many policemen can we expect?
- About 480 units.

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,750
And your men, Suárez. Get your asses
over to that fucking stream! Come on!

167
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,083
Communication constantly.

168
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,708
SUBWAY
BANK OF SPAIN

169
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,875
<i>Vamos, vamos, vamos!</i>

170
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,875
There's not a lot of movement outside.
Just a few vehicles leaving the perimeter.

171
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,416
Stay alert, but it should
get quiet for a little while.

172
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,791
The police are still looking for me
in downtown Madrid.

173
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,000
Take this time to rest.

174
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,166
Arteche, do you copy?
Arteche, do you copy?

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,250
Arteche, what's going on?

176
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,000
I need a few minutes.

177
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,583
Okay, roger that.

178
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,333
Stockholm...

179
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,458
Stockholm...

180
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,750
Stockholm. It's Tokyo.

181
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm here.

182
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,708
What's going on? Mónica!

183
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,583
Mónica! Mónica!

184
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,333
What happened? What's wrong?

185
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,125
What's wrong?

186
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,291
Hey.

187
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,458
I'm going crazy.

188
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,083
I saw Arturo. Arturo talks to me.

189
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,541
And Tokyo... Tokyo's in the...
She's out there in the dumbwaiter.

190
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,333
Hey, it's nothing. It's nothing, okay?

191
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,416
I think I'm having a psychotic break.

192
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,458
I see things and shoot at them.
I'm dangerous. I need to get out.

193
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,916
- I need medical help.
- No. You can't get out of here.

194
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,333
Denver, I surrender. I want to get out.

195
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,000
I was so close to killing you.

196
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,833
- I'm dangerous.
- Hey, listen to me.

197
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,208
I'll tell you what, okay?
Here's what we'll do.

198
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,875
Listen, we're gonna lock you inside
one of those vaults.

199
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,708
- No.
- You won't be able to hurt anyone.

200
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,208
- I'm dangerous. I have to get out.
- I'll take care of you.

201
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll take care of you.
If you don't get better, I'll get you out.

202
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,125
Okay?

203
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,250
Okay.

204
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,458
Suárez, all the locations
have to be checked.

205
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,625
<i>Your unit will go
to the sewage treatment plant.</i>

206
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,875
<i>The other units will continue south.</i>

213
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,166
I shouldn't have said anything. Sorry.

214
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,791
I don't know why I told you about Manila.

215
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,583
No, Denver.

216
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,583
What you said was painful but...

217
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,833
somehow I'm glad you said it.

218
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,791
I think it's the most honest thing
you've said to me

219
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,250
in a very long time.

220
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,125
And anyway, I knew about Manila,
so it's all right.

221
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,833
I knew that already.

222
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,958
What do you mean you already knew?

223
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,583
She told me herself.

224
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,833
And I also knew about Indonesia too.
I mean, I sort of guessed.

225
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,833
Why did you let me lie to you?

226
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,916
I suppose it was easier to accept
that you needed an escape than...

227
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,500
to ask you whether our life together was...

228
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,125
that boring to you,
in case you said "yes," Denver.

229
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,833
Because, well, I loved our life together.

230
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,750
A lot.

231
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,875
I loved it too.

232
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,083
Then why did you lie?

233
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,291
I don't know.

234
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,500
I don't...

235
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,750
I guess I was afraid
that my dad was right.

236
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,083
He always used to say
I wasn't good enough for you.

237
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,666
That I didn't measure up, you know?

238
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,416
He was right.

239
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:21,208
Who'd want to be with a guy
who needs to go 60 miles away from home

240
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,666
just to go partying in a club,
drink like crazy,

241
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,416
getting hammered and picking a fight
with the first person I see?

242
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,916
I was afraid to show you that side of me.

243
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,791
That animal.

244
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,916
I was afraid you'd leave me.

245
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,875
- Are they here?
- Yeah.

246
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,750
The ectoplasms?

247
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,500
It's... It's not funny, Denver.

248
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,750
- No, no, no, I... I wasn't joking.
- No.

249
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,041
- You know what pisses me off?
- What?

250
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,333
That fucking Arturo.
He's a pain in the ass.

251
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,583
So much, he even manages
to get into your psychotic breaks.

252
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,892
I know they're real.

253
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:08,875
Because it's, well, post-traumatic stress,
tension during the heist...

254
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,958
A psychotic break. I know.

255
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,000
But this whole having visions thing...
Just imagine nice things.

256
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,208
- What do you want me to imagine?
- Something that makes you smile.

257
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,151
Anything that doesn't make you
want to empty your gun, okay?

258
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,208
'Cause you almost killed me.

259
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,416
You know what I would like to imagine?

260
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,541
What?

261
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,333
You.

262
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,541
In one of those clubs,
dancing like a maniac.

263
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,625
I'm not sure
you'd like that, I'm telling you.

264
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,708
Yeah?

265
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,333
And you?

266
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,791
- What?
- Dancing.

267
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,916
- Here?
- Yeah.

268
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,083
- No.
- Yeah, dance for me.

269
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,500
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

270
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,708
Look at me, I'm all filthy
in these red overalls. No. No.

271
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,958
I can work with that.

272
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,375

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,625
Imagine if things go south here,
and they arrest us.

324
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:37,458
What will they say on TV?
"They've arrested Palermo, Rio,

325
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,708
Manila, Bogotá...

326
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,083

what you have in mind, huh?

329
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,666
Pamplona.

330
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:53,791
Yeah, you nailed it.

331
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,500
A city in Spain. How unexpected.

332
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,791
What the fuck is wrong with "Pamplona"?

333
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,875
Get a real name. Something mythical.

334
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:04,250
Something that sounds good, like...

335
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,208
Rio.

336
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,375
Mm-hmm.

337
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,458
Sweetie, "Manila."
Manila is exotic, sexy, burlesque...

338
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,000
- "Sydney."
- "Palermo."

339
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,434
- "Palermo."
- It's taken...

340
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,250
- "Marrakesh."
- "Charbonier."

341
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,291
For fuck's sake.
Have you ever been to Pamplona?

342
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,916
Huh? The wildest festival in the world
is held there, the Sanfermines.

343
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,833
Even people from Japan
come to run with the bulls.

344
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,583
And Hemingway wrote a novel.

345
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,541
They even study it in the States.

346
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,125
You know what it's called in Spain?
Huh? The novel?

347
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,041
<i>Fiesta.</i>

348
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,833
It's called <i>Fiesta!</i>

349
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,666
You want party time?
Then go to the fucking Sanfermines!

350
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,541
Yeah, fuck it. That's it, "Pamplona."

351
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,791
To Pamplona!

352
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,750
- To Pamplona, cheers.
- Yeah!

353
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,250
- Pamplona it is.
- That's right.

354
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,833
It's all good.

355
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:20,875
<i>♪ You're just too good to be true ♪</i>

362
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,416
Don't worry, okay?
Tatiana just went upstairs to her room.

363
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,250
Good evening.

364
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,041
A Negroni, please.

365
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,125
Do you know what elegance is?

366
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,583
Look at that.

367
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:08,333
When you see a guy like that,
dapper, impeccable,

368
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,416
you think,
"I'd go fuck his wife right now"

369
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,458
without ever seeing her.

370
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,958
Because you're absolutely convinced
that his wife must look incredible.

371
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,041
That's why you decided
to sleep with my wife.

372
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,041
Theoretically, you should be
the one seducing wives.

373
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:31,750
I'm not sure it should be your father
who seduces them on your behalf.

374
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,250
I just couldn't help it.

375
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,666
I wish that, um, well,
that I could have told you

376
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,708
about the whole situation myself, but I...

377
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,583
I... I couldn't help it, Dad.
And I'm... I'm sorry.

378
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,583
I just couldn't help it...

379
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,708
Shh-shh-shh, shh-shh.

380
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:00,791
For how long?

381
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,583
Uh, two weeks. Um...

382
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,416
Three.

383
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:08,791
Three weeks.

384
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:12,708
Then what we had
wasn't so powerful and so strong

385
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:17,125
as to... to resist the advances
of a casual lover.

386
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,041
Casual?

387
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,541
Seriously, Dad?

388
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,458
Casual, huh?

389
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,375
Maybe Tatiana's in love with me.
Have you thought of that?

390
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,666
You didn't consider that option, did you?

391
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,833
Because I'm absolutely
in love with her, Dad.

392
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,083
Really.

393
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,291
And no matter what anybody else thinks,
this is a true love story.

394
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,083
It was inevitable.

395
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,125
Wow, look at you.

396
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,166
This is the first time I actually feel
like you might measure up.

397
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,791
And I also would've pursued
my father's wife

398
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,208
if I'd fallen in love with her.

399
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,375
I wouldn't think about it
even for a minute.

400
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,708
I would have broken
the sacred limits of our family,

401
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,916
and respect,

402
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,000
just to satisfy my love.

403
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,125
And in this light, I'm...

404
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,708
very proud of you.

405
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,708
Look who's coming.

406
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,416
I have to admit,
you're better off with him.

407
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,875
He's young, attractive,

408
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,666
intelligent,

409
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,958
ambitious, unscrupulous like his father,

410
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,750
and apparently healthy.

411
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,416
Of course, the downside
is that in just a year, maybe two years,

412
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,583
you'll miss out on the widow's pension
and a truly enormous inheritance.

413
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,833
We had a great time.

414
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,125
I wish you the best.

415
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,791
You may go in peace.

439
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,083
<i>He let them catch him.</i>

440
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,041
<i>On top of that,
they matched his fingerprints</i>

441
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,875
<i>with a pair found at another robbery.</i>

442
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,958
<i>So he was charged a few extra months.</i>

443
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,583
<i>But he didn't care about jail.</i>

444
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,708
<i>Not when his heart
had just been shattered.</i>

445
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,916
<i>Santa Justa stormwater tank.</i>

446
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,333
<i>I repeat, the next place is
the Santa Justa stormwater tank.</i>

447
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,375
This is Bronze Unit to Tamayo.
We're approaching the exit.

448
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:14,791
Colonel, this is Suárez.

449
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,083
<i>We're approaching the stormwater tank.</i>

450
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,208
Let's go, guys. Come on.
It has to be here! We got 'em!

451
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,833
It's the police!

452
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:48,666
They're coming!

453
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,541
Come on! Take your weapons!

454
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
They're coming!

455
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,541
Hurry up!

456
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,791
Come on, let's go.

457
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,375
Come on. Grab the weapons,
for fuck's sake.

458
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,000
Professor, take shelter.
Take the weapon. Take the weapon.

459
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,083
Take it!

460
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,791
Professor! What's wrong with you? Wake up!

461
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,458
They're coming! Take the weapon!

462
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:47,458
- Take it, Professor!
- No. No, no. Drop the weapon.

463
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,916
Drop your weapons!

464
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,833
It's just four cars.
We can deal with them.

465
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:53,375
No. Right now it's four cars.

466
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:57,875
Then it'll be ten, then 50, then the army.
Don't you get it?

467
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:00,958
They found out we're here.
We can't do anything, Benjamín.

468
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,458
They know we're here.
There's nothing to do.

469
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,625
Benjamín, nothing! Do you hear me?
Everyone, drop your weapons.

470
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,101
Didn't you hear me? Drop your weapons!

471
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,500
Come on! Let's defend ourselves!

472
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:16,208
- No! Please, Marseille, don't do it.
- Get out of the way.

473
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,416
Out of the way.

474
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,208
I didn't surrender
when they arrested Lisbon.

475
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:23,458
I didn't do it when
that whole Spanish army entered the bank,

476
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,833
or when that motherfucking
Gandía killed Nairobi!

477
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,541
- You're going to do it now.
- No.

478
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,665
It's an order!

479
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,541
Sergio, they killed Tokyo!

480
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:34,541
Marseille, listen to me.

481
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,583
Listen to me. Listen to me.

482
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,958
- I'm not allowing this to be a slaughter.
- No.

483
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,641
I won't let innocent people die
for something that's already lost.

484
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:44,708
No!

485
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,250
It's already lost.

486
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,125
It's already lost.

487
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,583
Mmm.

488
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,791
I just got out of jail.

489
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,125
You picked me up, brought me here,

490
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:55,833
and for the last 157 km,
you've been completely silent.

491
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,291
There's really nothing you want to know?

492
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,125
Maybe I've been raped in the showers.

493
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:09,083
Or maybe I tattooed our mother's name
on my biceps.

494
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,541
You let them catch you.

495
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,333
You've pulled 27 heists
across half of Europe,

496
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,541
but that day you decided
to smash a cocktail bar

497
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,541
in downtown Madrid
and you let them catch you?

498
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,708
The Negroni was terrible.
I couldn't tolerate such an abomination.

499
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,583
I lost my son and it broke my heart.

500
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,541
I can understand
being betrayed by my wife.

501
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,708
Or a partner, or even my son.

502
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,958
But I lost him,

503
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,958
right when I decided

504
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,500
to admit his existence for the first time.

505
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:52,750
That's like getting hit in the face
by your own failure.

506
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,916
By the certainty
that something in your life is wrong.

507
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:58,291
And there it is.

508
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,833
In your failure...

509
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,750
is how a man is defined.

510
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:09,541
Some people hide like cowards.

511
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,666
Others face it.

512
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,125
Some rebel against it,

513
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,291
but without dignity.

514
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,041
And other people

515
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,791
can't help but to destroy everything

516
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,583
in order to have another life.

517
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,083
I swear to you...

518
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,833
I don't have much time,

519
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:39,000
but I'll squeeze every second,
every second till its last drop.

520
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,708
That's why now I want to help you...

521
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,708
...to pull off
the heist of a lifetime.

522
00:41:54,541 --> 00:42:00,041
Before I die, you and I are going to rob
the Royal Mint of Spain.

523
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:15,958
God! God!

524
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,625
God!

525
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:23,083
Oh! God!

526
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,666
Little brother!

527
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,750
God!

528
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,125
How long will we get?

529
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,000
A thousand years.

530
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,458
- How long have we been here?
- Fifteen, 20 minutes.

531
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:14,041
They should have taken us
into police custody by now.

532
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,125
Exactly.

533
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,083
They must be waiting for forensics.

534
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,208
I can hear the sirens.

535
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,750
I can hear the radios,
but I'm not hearing any of the cars.

536
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,125
Why can't we hear any of the cars?

537
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,083
<i>Why wouldn't the police
be waiting on the other side?</i>

538
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,750
- That's an excellent question, Sergio.
- Good question.

539
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,750
And we've got the answer to that as well.

540
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,958
Of course we'll get the gold out
through the only place we can, but...

541
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,625
not in the direction
the police will expect.

542
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,083
It's a tank for residual water.

543
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,791
Suárez, just go for it!
Go for it! They're in there!

544
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,333
- Police!
<i>- We got 'em!</i>

545
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,083
Colonel, this entire place is empty.

546
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,625
Fuck! It doesn't make sense.

547
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,208
The most logical decision
would be to take advantage

548
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,083
of the gentle river slope
and get the gold out that direction, but,

549
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,208
mm, that would just be way too easy.

550
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:20,333
It's the last place where
the channels flow into. I don't get it!

551
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,666
How is this possible?

552
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,583
Then, we'll take advantage
of the 5,000 kilowatts of our pump

553
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,291
to push the gold upstream

554
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,541
almost 18 km.

555
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:33,208
We'll get the gold up the river,
like a fucking salmon,

556
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:36,583
running all the way
to this stormwater tank.

557
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:39,000
And that, my dear friend,
no one will expect.

558
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,791
We've combed 25 km of pipes
with metal detectors and found nothing.

559
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,875
Not the police, nor the CNI,

560
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,541
nor the Spanish National Research Council.

561
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,541
No one.

562
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:51,125
Ninety tons of gold
can't just disappear.

563
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,541
They didn't get it out that way, damn it!
They didn't.

564
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,125
Then where the fuck is that gold?

565
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,125
They couldn't have gotten it out
any other way!

566
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,833
Someone tell me
where the fuck is that fucking gold!

567
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
BANK OF SPAIN

568
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,083
LOS MIGUELES STORMWATER TANK

569
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,583
You're fucking kidding me.

570
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,791
Victoria. Victoria...

571
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,250
My baby.

572
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,625
Fuck!

573
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,666
Victoria.

574
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,583
Someone's stolen the gold.

575
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,958
Fuck yeah! We did it!
