1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,291
<i>Assault unit approaching.</i>

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,666
<i>Okay, I want a precise operation.</i>

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,541
<i>Suspects are armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

4
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,416
Okay, move, move, move!
First floor, clear.

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,625
<i>Search every floor
and check the exits.</i>

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,208
Come on!

7
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,541
Second floor, clear.

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
Please...

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,833
One, two...

10
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,666
Let's go! Come on, come on!

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,916
Police!

12
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,375
Colonel, are you okay?

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,375
My wife... My wife...

14
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,083
Luis...

15
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,625
How long have I been out for?

16
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,083
I don't know. A few minutes.

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,000
It's Alicia Sierra. She's carrying a baby.

18
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,625
No one has left the building.

19
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,875
Then check every apartment.
If nobody answers, break the door down.

20
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,583
Go set up a cage operation.

21
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,458
Get me a perimeter of two km.
No one comes in or out.

22
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,541
Bravo 41 calling all available units.

23
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,500
Operation Cage. District, Chamberí.
Limits, Valdebebas and Canillas.

24
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,958
I repeat, Bravo 41
calling all available units.

25
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,416
Listen to me, ma'am.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,166
Everything's going to be okay,
but you can't scream.

27
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,166
Give me the baby.

28
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,750
And my glasses. I need my glasses.

29
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,291
- Open the door!
- Police!

30
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,416
You're bleeding so much.
You're not leaving?

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,750
I have to go back.

32
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,916
I'm ready for the final sprint.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,666
But I can promise you one thing,

34
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,833
this is gonna be my last one.

35
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,000
Call the army.

36
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,583
This is now a state of emergency.

37
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,375
We're gonna search this whole
<i>fucking</i> neighborhood door to door.

38
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,250
No.

39
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,125
Be cool.

40
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,625
Open the <i>fucking</i> door!

41
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,041
Open the door!

42
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,250
Shh!

43
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,083
Come on! Follow me! Let's go!

44
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,416
Have a good night.

45
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,300
- What's going on?
- Out of the way.

46
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,166
No fucking way.

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,750
Police!

48
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,708
Open the door! It's the police!

49
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,166
- Open it!
- The baby. The baby!

50
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,375
She's sleeping.

51
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,750
Shh!

52
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,416
The baby. The baby...

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,666
The baby's fine.

54
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,833
Buenas noches.

55
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,541
Let's go, let's go!

56
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,083
Clear!

57
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,875
<i>They climbed out the window.</i>

58
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,666
- The glasses.
- What?

59
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,000
- They're sunglasses. It's nighttime.
- So what? Who cares?

60
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,583
- Just take them off.
- Shut up.

61
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,625
They're here.

62
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,166
- They're here.
- Shut up.

63
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,625
They're here. They're here. They're here.

64
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,583
<i>They're on the street.
They left through the restaurant.</i>

65
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,958
I think taking the metro
would be the best.

66
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,000
Professor?

67
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,041
Professor, do you copy?

68
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
Shh, boys.

69
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,958
- Professor?
<i>- Professor?</i>

70
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,208
- <i>Marseille calling Benjamín.</i>
- I hear you.

71
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,416
The Professor's down.

72
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,625
What?

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,250
I think Alicia Sierra
kidnapped him, again.

74
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,875
My men are here. What should we do?

75
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,000
Like the Professor told you.
You're in charge there.

76
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,375
<i>I'll take the three cars
to the stormwater tank.</i>

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,708
We can't leave any loose ends.

78
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,166
What?

79
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,625
Apartment 2B.

80
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,208
Let's go.

81
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,916
There.

82
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,916
Nothing.

83
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,625
Come on.

84
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,541
Clear.

85
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,375
Fuck, just a cat.

86
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,041
"Plants, water them twice a week.
The cat, feed once a day."

87
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,291
"Thanks, Herminia."

88
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,916
They were watered today.

89
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,291
So Herminia won't be back until tomorrow.

90
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,208
<i>The government
has declared a state of emergency.</i>

91
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,916
<i>We're here to protect you.</i>

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>Please cooperate as our officers work
for the safety of the State of Spain.</i>

93
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,416
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Go, go, go, go!

94
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,791
This is starting to look like
the Warsaw ghetto.

95
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,125
They're going to search every house.

96
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:18,375
<i>♪ If I stay with you
If I'm choosing wrong ♪</i>

97
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,500

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,208
Hey. Come here. Come here. Hmm?

106
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,458
You're not starting to get
affected by my illness?

107
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,166
Hmm? Or are you?

108
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,916
No.

109
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,083
- No.
- Yeah.

110
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,291
It's just that, um,
I'm moved by this plan,

111
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,666
this marvelous plan for the gold.

112
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,875
But there's still
a couple of details that...

113
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,416
- That what?
- Well, um...

114
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,000
- Getting the gold out, for example.
- Little grains.

115
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,083
We're going to turn
90 tons of gold into rice.

116
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,791
And after that, propel it like a jet.

117
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah. We'll eject all of it
using a pressure pump.

118
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,500
- Using a pump?
- Yeah.

119
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,750
- Through the pipelines?
- Mm-hmm.

120
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,335
Inside the Bank of Spain
is there a pressure pump?

121
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,000
- No, of course not.
- Of course not!

122
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,500
We had to go all the way up to Norway
to get it off an oil platform.

123
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,041
What do you think about that?

124
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,125
I mean,
there was another one in Saudi Arabia.

125
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,250
- But I was too lazy to go so far away.
- Of course.

126
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,791
What matters, Sergio,

127
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:15,208
is that we're going to have a geyser
of golden light flowing through the pipes.

128
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
There's no margin of error.

129
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,416
Andrés, the whole plan, everything
you're saying is a margin of error.

130
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,750
How old are those pipes?
Fifty? Seventy years old?

131
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,250
How old are they?

132
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,291
A hundred.

133
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,833
And do you think
that they were built 100 years ago

134
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,291
to withstand pressurized gold?

135
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
No, but they're gonna hold!

136
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,750
Very well. Where does the gold arrive?
In a sewer?

137
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,666
No!

138
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,416
I just love this.

139
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,291
In the biggest stormwater tank in Europe.

140
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,791
In a stormwater tank?
What happens if it rains?

141
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,583
What if it starts pouring rain that day?
It would collapse, right?

142
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,506
And then bye-bye plan,
bye-bye your whole life,

143
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,503
because of a simple fact
that it started raining.

144
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,875
Andrés, no, it's not science, it's...
It's voluntarism...

145
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,583
It's scientific optimism!

146
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,166
What are you talking about?

147
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,541
- It's hopeful science.
- Who's talking here?

148
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,083
The mind of someone planning a heist
or the mind of a child? Come on.

149
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,250
The mind of a child.

150
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,166
And proudly so.

151
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,541
- I'm just like Peter Pan.
- Yeah.

152
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,500
No one can take away my enthusiasm,
not you, nobody.

153
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,916
Because only then,

154
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,750
only when you're willfully immature,

155
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,583
can you achieve great things.

156
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,541
The sort... The sort of things that, uh,

157
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,666
uh, mature people, serious people,
could never achieve. No.

158
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,708
No, they can't even imagine it
because they're all too <i>sensible!</i>

159
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:42,208
And for those of us
who have to think about what we do,

160
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,583
is there anything solid?

161
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,375
Anything?

162
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,625
Because I'd love to...
I'd love to examine it.

163
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,458
Look, Martín has
all that stuff completely...

164
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,875
He's crossed every T. Every detail.

165
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,916
And he'd be delighted
to share it with you.

166
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,375
Guys, come on!

167
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,458
The waterwheel goes last. Come on!

168
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,208
The waterwheel goes last.

169
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,458
Benjamín, are you still there?

170
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,708
Yes. Go ahead, Miss Lisbon.

171
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,500
The Professor has disappeared.

172
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,559
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

173
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,000
What do you mean
"The Professor has disappeared"?

174
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
Is he in the fucking
Bermuda Triangle or what?

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,208
How should I know? I don't know.

176
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:36,958
Oh, for fuck's sake...

177
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,416
What matters right now
is that we make a decision.

178
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,083
What are we doing with the gold?

179
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,458
I'm sorry, my dear, were you
planning on having a referendum here?

180
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,333
Because I don't give a shit
about democracy, okay?

181
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,666
The gold is getting out.

182
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,791
There is nothing to debate.

183
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,750
If you let this group debate anything,
they all pull out guns.

184
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,083
So I'm drawing mine first.
No bullshit, okay?

185
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,041
And what if the cops are already
at the stormwater tank right now?

186
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,041
The police are not
at the stormwater tank.

187
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,541
The plan is still on course, understand?

188
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,083
But if that were the case, this would be
the stupidest robbery in history.

189
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,833
Melting down 90 tons of gold
to hand it over to the police.

190
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,625
I said the police are not
at the stormwater tank,

191
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,208
and the gold is worth nothing to us here.
Do you get it or not, my love?

192
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,083
The gold is our hostage.

193
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,208
That's <i>great.</i>

194
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,208
We take the hostage,
offer it to Tamayo, and negotiate?

195
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,875
Is that your master plan?
You're a real fucking genius.

196
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Yeah, muchacho, I'm a fucking genius.

197
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,000
And there's a big machine down there
that'll prove it, so take it easy.

198
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,708
Is that all you care about?

199
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,000
Proving that your wonderful plan
is gonna work?

200
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,083
It's also about saving your lives.

201
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,000
And to do that,
we have to get the gold out of here.

202
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,500
Palermo is right.

203
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,916
There are only two people out there

204
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,125
who can tell them how to get the gold out.

205
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,458
The Professor, who won't do it,

206
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,416
and Alicia Sierra.

207
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,875
She's gonna try to use the information
to negotiate and clear her name.

208
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,875
And I assure you

209
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,041
negotiating with the State will be tough.

210
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,666
<i>It's gonna take hours.</i>

211
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,458
In the meantime, we can get the gold out.
And that's <i>exactly</i> what we'll do.

212
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,125
This lady has sex appeal and cojones.

213
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,708
We're gonna get
the<i> fucking </i>gold outta here!

214
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,291
We're gonna get the gold out.

215
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,000
<i>At that moment,
Palermo regained his passion.</i>

216
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,000
<i>The last time he'd had
that sparkle in his eyes</i>

217
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,583
<i>was five years earlier,</i>

218
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,083
<i>right after he was woken up
in the middle of the night.</i>

219
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,500
I told him about the plan.

220
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,000
What did he say?

221
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,625
Let's just say he thought it was...

222
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
so truly marvelous.

223
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,958
No, I'll be more precise.

224
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,541
He said it's the most beautiful thing
he's ever heard.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,083
Stop fucking around.
Are you serious or not?

226
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,125
Martín.

227
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,750
Of course I only told him the basics.

228
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,500
Now he wants you to explain
all the technical details.

229
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,916
So, it's your turn.

230
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,541
I can't believe it!

231
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,583
Oh my God, I can't believe you.

232
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Let's see.

233
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,708
Houndstooth? Scottish tartan?
Something that exudes intellectualism.

234
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,125
I'd say that's a little sophisticated
for three in the morning.

235
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,750
A touch of genius, sure,
but, uh, maybe something more casual.

236
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,083
<i>"Maturity" meant the same
to Palermo as it did to Berlin,</i>

237
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,500
<i>the end of a life of passion</i>

238
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,250
<i>and the beginning of a life
filled with bitterness.</i>

239
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,708
<i>At the end of the day,
maturing, as well as growing old,</i>

240
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,750
<i>consists of gradually
throwing away dreams.</i>

241
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,166
Bogotá!

242
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,166
Bogotá, the water!

243
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,625
- Bogotá!
- What?

244
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,166
Get in the water!

245
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,958
You didn't have to
get him out of bed at this hour.

246
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,041
It would've been fine
to do this tomorrow morning.

247
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,583
Please, Sergio.
It's an enormous privilege to be here.

248
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,833
Now what exactly does your curiosity
and sharp intellect demand?

249
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:25,958
Tell me.

250
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,250
Okay. Let's say we've turned
the 90 tons into gravel.

251
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,625
- Yeah?
- Now what?

252
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:36,083
Now we put the diver back in the water,
but this time, he'll have two hoses.

253
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,666
After we completely ransack that vault
like the tomb of Tutankhamun,

254
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
the diver will make the key connection.

255
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,041
Connection that will allow us
to move the gold.

256
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
- How so?
- We have the vault right here, right?

257
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,458
120,000 liters of water.
<i>That </i>will be our driving force.

258
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,291
<i>The water goes into this pump,
through this black hose,</i>

259
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,083
where it'll be mixed with the gold.

260
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,500
And through this red hose,

261
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,916
the 90 tons of gravel will flow smoothly,

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,416
<i>towards the drainage system.</i>

263
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,583
- What caliber is the hose?
- Five inches.

264
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,125
A five-inch hose couldn't possibly handle
the pressure you need to get the gold out.

265
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,208
Exactly.

266
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,291
Because, for now,
the gold will stay in the sanitation ducts

267
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,000
sleeping peacefully.

268
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,333
The <i>real</i> pressure...

269
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,208
that comes just a bit later.

270
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,166
<i>This is a message
to all residents on the block.</i>

271
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,531
<i>We will forcefully enter
any house that doesn't cooperate.</i>

272
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,416
Go, go, go, go!

273
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
<i>Keep in mind that we're doing this
for the safety of our country.</i>

274
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,458
What are you doing?

275
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,041
We're going to hide.

276
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,000
Armed forces.
Open the door, please.

277
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,291
Hurry.

278
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,208
Open the door.

279
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,708
Open the <i>door!</i>

280
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,458
Armed forces! Open the door!

281
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,416
Open the door, now!

282
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,541
Open the door! Armed forces!

283
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,333
- Open the door!
- Or we'll break it down!

284
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,416
Go get the manager.

285
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,083
Open the door!

286
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,000
Open the door!

287
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,833
- Come on, now!
- Open the door!

288
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,916
What's going on?

289
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,791
- No one's there. They're on vacation.
- Well, open it anyway.

290
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,416
Everyone get ready.

291
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,625
- This isn't it, it's 2A. Give me a moment.
- Make it quick.

292
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,208
These things take time.
It's not that easy.

293
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,041
Let's go.

294
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,083
The baby, the baby. The baby.

295
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,291
Do you even know
what key it is?

296
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,291
Get down.

297
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,041
Delta Unit going in.

298
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,309
<i>Alfa Unit in position.</i>

299
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,625
Shh-shh-shh.

300
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,541
<i>Bravo Unit,
first floor checked and clear.</i>

301
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,708
<i>Clear!</i>

302
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,208
<i>Delta Unit,
send the manager to the third floor.</i>

303
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,208
Psst.

304
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,500
Bedroom clear. We're leaving.

305
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,250
It's all clear. Come on.

306
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,125
They're gone.

307
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,583
They're gone.

308
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:57,708
Gentlemen! Today we make our mark
on the universal history of larceny!

309
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,833
Come on, muchachos!
Let's make history together, goddammit!

310
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,458
- Let's go!
- Come on!

311
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,541
Let's go!

312
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,208
<i>Then the next stage
of the plan begins,</i>

313
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:13,250
which enables us to move the gold
that was resting in the drainpipes.

314
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,583
Well, that would cause
a massive clog in the pipelines.

315
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,791
That's why
we have a second pump, huh?

316
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,208
The one we stole in Norway.

317
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,458
Now! Connect the pump!

318
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,250
Let's go, muchachos! Let's go!

319
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,541
Isn't she precious? I'm in love.

320
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,791
<i>It's a technical marvel,
5,300 kilowatts of power.</i>

321
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,541
<i>Do you realize what that means, Sergio?</i>

322
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,166
We're gonna move the gold
3.25 meters per second. It's absurd!

323
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,625
There's one problem with that.

324
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,458
Now he's wondering what about...?

325
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,791
What about the loss of pressure
due to friction?

326
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,208
The Darcy-Weisbach equation.
We got it down to the millimeter.

327
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,041
- The only problem we might have...
- Is using too much pressure.

328
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,166
Okay, open the valves!

329
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,875
There's a pressure regulator on the pump.
We'll control it ourselves.

330
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,208
<i>I'll activate the pump.</i>

331
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,875
<i>The pump will then start pushing the gold.</i>

332
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,458
And 91 minutes and 37 seconds later...

333
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:07,583
...our loot will have traveled
across the 17,874 meters of pipe

334
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,333
between the goldvault and point B,

335
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,833
the space we commonly refer to
as the "stormwater tank."

336
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,333
And then, right in that place,

337
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,958
there will be manna
raining down from heaven.

338
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,333
Sergio, am I crazy? Or do you see it too?

339
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,208
Bogotá, pressure!

340
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,333
Three thousand kilopascals!

341
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,666
Thirty-five hundred!

342
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:40,958
Let's go, my love.

343
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,375
Four thousand!

344
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,708
That's it, precious. That's it.

345
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,708
Let's go, faster! Come on!

346
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,458
Forty-five hundred!

347
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,750
Five thousand! Now!

348
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,875
There's nothing.

349
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,375
Relax, we still have a few seconds.
Relax, don't get anxious.

350
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,791
We're getting there.

351
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,708
Ten...

352
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,916
nine...

353
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,625
eight...

354
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,708
...seven...

355
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,708
<i>six...</i>

356
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,208
five...

357
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,333
<i>four...</i>

358
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,333
three...

359
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:48,541
two...

360
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,041
one.

361
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,500
Now!

362
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,458
- Benjamín, do you copy?
- Still nothing.

363
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,916
No, no...

364
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,208
No, no, no.

365
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,375
I'm telling you, nothing here.

366
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:28,041
<i>Maybe there was a miscalculation.</i>

367
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,416
God damn it!

368
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,375
Science shall not live on numbers
and calculations alone, Benjamín.

369
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,125
Have a little faith, no?

370
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,833
And a little love too.

371
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,083
Come on, darling. Come on.

372
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,833
It's not just the gold.

373
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,916
It's all the nights
we spent planning it together.

374
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,125
<i>Countless hours</i>

375
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,541
<i>absolutely stuck on the same problems.</i>

376
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,625
<i>The joy, the euphoria we felt
when we finally came up with the solution.</i>

377
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,083
Those are the most
beautiful memories of my life.

378
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,875
I'm begging you, for the love of God,

379
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,625
don't let this be a mistake.

380
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:22,083
Don't let it be an illusion.
I'm begging you, for God's sake.

381
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:25,625
I'm begging you, my darling, come on.
Please, let's go, damn it.

382
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,791
Come on, darling! You can do it.
Come on. Come on, my love. Come on!

383
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,708
Come on!

384
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,916
Palermo, it's coming out!

385
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,208
<i>The gold is coming out!</i>

386
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,041
- Come on!
- Yeah!

387
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,583
Set up the waterwheel.

388
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:25,375
Benjamín, start making the ingots.

389
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:28,125
Let's go! Let's start making ingots!

390
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,166
We did it, Tokyo.

391
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,166
We did it.

392
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,708
A flow of 55,200 liters
of water and gold per minute, brother.

393
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
It's poetry. It's pure poetry.

394
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,916
Huh? Right?

395
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:08,791
How was your shower?

396
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,583
Hey.

397
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,833
Too bad there's no men's clothing here,
right, Victoria?

398
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,031
When was the last time you ate?

399
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,375
What day is it today?

400
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,291
I'm gonna go try to make something warm.

401
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,958
<i>This is the Harris Hawk,
a bird of prey, an expert hunter.</i>

402
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,500
<i>The moment it detects a potential prey,</i>

403
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,916
<i>it swoops down at full speed.</i>

404
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,458
Eat this. It'll be good for you.

405
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,583
I don't think I can remember
the last time someone took care of me.

406
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,458
Actually, I can.

407
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,708
My husband.

408
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,291
I didn't shed a single tear
at his funeral.

409
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,375
I tortured Aníbal Cortés.

410
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,083
And I felt nothing<i>.</i>

411
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,583
Nothing.

412
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,375
They ruined my career. Still nothing.

413
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,708
The only thing I've done since then...

414
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,083
was chase after you.

415
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,041
Without feeling the nausea.

416
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:14,875
Or the exhaustion.

417
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,916
Because I...

418
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:23,416
I thought if I ran fast enough...

419
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,125
the sadness wouldn't catch up with me.

420
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,666
And now, look.

421
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,708
Here we are.

422
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,875
Here we are.

423
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,708
Can we pretend...

424
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,000
that you're a friend who came over
to cook and see the baby?

425
00:31:56,083 --> 00:32:00,208
Because maybe this is the last normal day
we'll have for the next 25 years.

426
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,375
Let's imagine there's no cops out there.

427
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,125
And we'll eat,
and you can ask me stupid things,

428
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:12,000
things about the baby,
until she falls asleep,

429
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,083
while we watch TV.

430
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,291
What do you think?

431
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,708
Mmm.

432
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,208
Yeah, of course.

433
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,083
Don't get me wrong.

434
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,916
I'm <i>not</i> your friend.

435
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,000
And I never will be.

436
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,125
I'll never be your friend.

437
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,583
To me, this is a marriage of convenience.

438
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,083
No? Don't you agree?

439
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,041
Eat. Go on.

440
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,291
It's good. Thanks.

441
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,250
Say something.

442
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,791
Over the last few hours...

443
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,666
I've lost two more people...

444
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,791
who were very important.

445
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,875
Not for the plan, no.
Not for the heist, no.

446
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,500
They were important to me.

447
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,416
To my personal life.

448
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,500
And I'm not going to let...

449
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,958
anyone else down

450
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:37,958
during this heist.

451
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,250
I'm not gonna let you down.

452
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,208
Okay.

453
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,083
So, uh,

454
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:03,875
you'd better start
getting used to this kind of situation.

455
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,000
Because I'm not going to allow

456
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,416
Victoria to grow up
in a prison maternity ward.

457
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,958
Okay, I guess I won't arrest you then.

458
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:31,625
Sounds good to me.

459
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,041
<i>Like a velociraptor...</i>

460
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,458
- <i>...it chases its prey on the ground.</i>
- Sergio...

461
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,666
Mm-hmm?

462
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,875
We need to get you some new shoes.

463
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,625
<i>The kangaroo rat
makes a run for it, but the little rodent...</i>

464
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:06,166
We need to rebuild the bone
and anchor it to a titanium plate.

465
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,000
I have to put him
under general anesthesia.

466
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:08,958
What?

467
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,583
No, no, no, no.
I'm not going to sleep.

468
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:18,166
No. From the waist up, I'm a watchdog.

469
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,791
From the waist down, I'm a patient.

470
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:26,833
Doctor, you do your job, I can take it.

471
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,583
Use an epidural.

472
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,750
He's gonna be a cripple.

473
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,833
Well, scars scare the shit out of people,

474
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,958
and if we're going to jail,
scaring people isn't all that bad.

475
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:50,041
To be honest, I... I can't even
really imagine what prison is like.

476
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,958
Being in a cell?
It's an awful experience. It's horrible.

477
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,083
Horrible.

478
00:35:56,708 --> 00:36:00,208
But I think that the worst part
isn't losing your freedom.

479
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,125
It's losing all affection.

480
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,791
I don't know.
The lack of physical contact,

481
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,666
wanting to hug your daughter,

482
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,208
wanting your mother to hug you,

483
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,250
but they're not there.

484
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,083
And then there's Sergio.

485
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,958
I mean, now that
I've finally found a good guy...

486
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:26,375
My God. Twenty-five years in jail
would completely erase all that.

487
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:30,958
Because no relationship
can handle that solitude.

488
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:37,291
Either that, or, uh,
maybe you spend 25 years

489
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:41,000
thinking that everything
will be the same and suddenly,

490
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,958
when you finally have a chance
to be with that person and kiss them,

491
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,041
shit, you realize

492
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,916
that too much time has passed, right?

493
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,240
And that at the end of the day,

494
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,166
you've spent years and years
romanticizing something that's not...

495
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,125
That's not there, that doesn't exist.

496
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,833
I want you to know that I kissed Denver.

497
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,750
I'm telling you because, I swear,
because it really was nothing.

498
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,708
I know I shouldn't have done it,
but I just couldn't help it.

499
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,750
I was obsessed with him for years.

500
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,958
And I realized today
there's nothing there.

501
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:21,416
Hey.

502
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,375
Do you have anything for stress, Doctor?

503
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,625
An antipsychotic maybe.

504
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,125
I just passed the service corridors.
I'm at the junction.

505
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,291
Okay, now take a left.

506
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,291
In about 20 meters to your left,
you'll find a vent grate and you're there.

507
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,458
Don't waste
a single ounce of gold.

508
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,833
- Any problems with the smelting?
- No!

509
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,166
Oh man! This is fun, huh?

510
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Look at all this gold! Yeah!

511
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,666
Here we go! Let's go, guys!

512
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,375
- Go, go, go, go!
- Good job, guys!

513
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,583
We already have the first batch of ingots.

514
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:26,041
Perfect, Benjamín.
There's not much left here.

515
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,750
Let's go, guys! Keep it moving.

516
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,250
Hey...

517
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,166
- Is Lisbon single?
- What?

518
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,750
Lisbon. Is she seeing anyone?

519
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,916
Where the fuck did that come from?

520
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,583
It's just that I saw her
beating up on Rio, and...

521
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,916
Okay?

522
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,625
Chicks with that much cojones
get me hotter than a fucking furnace.

523
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,791
Hmm. Well, she went through
a really fucked-up relationship.

524
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,875
She needs someone
to restore her faith in men.

525
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,083
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

526
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,333
You just really gotta go for it. Okay?

527
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,250
She's got standards,
so you've gotta go all the way.

528
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,253
Don't just ask her for, like,
a walk in the park.

529
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:11,491
- That's right.
- Get it?

530
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:13,541
Exactly. Don't be too polite, okay?

531
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,791
Don't half-ass it,
knife between the teeth.

532
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,541
Look, Matías, here's what you gotta do.

533
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,250
As soon as you get a chance,
kiss her passionately on the mouth.

534
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:25,750
In the elevator, the bathroom, wherever.
Remember, she's just gotten out of prison.

535
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,958
Understand what I'm saying? Hey!

536
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,041
Go get her.

537
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,708
What's going on with you?

538
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,291
Uh...

539
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,791
I was, uh, unfaithful to my wife.

540
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,291
Oh.

541
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,125
With a hostage?

542
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:52,791
With Manila.

543
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,375
With Manila.

544
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,333
And did you go all the way?

545
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:04,375
Well, not all the way, no,
but we definitely made out.

546
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:05,958
And I started it.

547
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,666
Well...

548
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,726
Heat of the moment, it's not important.

549
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,666
Let's go, guys. It's time to shine!
Let's go! Come on!

550
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,583
Hold on. How is it not important?

551
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,916
A few seconds later, I made out
with Stockholm in the same room.

552
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,916
One girl's spit
ended up in the other's mouth.

553
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,333
She's shooting up morphine
to overcome post-traumatic stress,

554
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:30,250
and I'm here acting like an asshole.
I don't know what to tell her.

555
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,541
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

556
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,666
You're looking at it wrong, okay?

557
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:39,458
You should never, ever,
in your fucking life

558
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,916
admit you've been with another woman.

559
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,750
Especially not half an hour
after the fact.

560
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,250
Hey.

561
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,416
If you're feeling guilty,
fucking deal with it.

562
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,125
Next time, don't think with your dick.

563
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,208
You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

564
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:58,208
Even if she catches you
naked in bed with the other woman.

565
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,375
You just tell her
that she's hallucinating.

566
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,375
You keep quiet.

567
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,125
Hey, look at me.

568
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,083
Because once you've admitted it,

569
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:11,583
then it's written in stone,
like a signed confession to the police.

570
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,208
And no one, my friend,

571
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,041
no one can fix that.

572
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,291
Hey.

573
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:40,958
Sweetie.

574
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,250
Sergio.

575
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:10,958
What are you doing?

576
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:14,208
I found a cell phone. I was charging it.
It's already at two bars.

577
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,083
It's a little old, but it'll do.

578
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,750
INCOMING CALL

579
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,125
<i>Hello?</i>

580
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,833
- Uh... who are you?
- <i>I'm Shakir.</i>

581
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,583
The Professor's support in Asia.

582
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:53,750
Oh. Oh shit, okay. And I'm Benjamín.

583
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:56,375
- <i>I'll connect you to the Professor.</i>
- Sure, of course.

584
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,458
- Professor.
- <i>Benjamín, listen.</i>

585
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,833
<i>We don't have time.
You have to call the Serbians.</i>

586
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,208
They're already here.

587
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,000
I got them. I got them to come
and guard the perimeter outside.

588
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,916
I see. Great, Benjamín. That's great.

589
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,375
<i>Well, you put me in charge,</i>

590
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:17,541
and I'm just trying to do the best I can.

591
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:20,291
In that case, you have a new mission.

592
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,416
Marseille, let's go.

593
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:29,041
We have a mission. Tell the Serbians.

594
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,083
Boris, with us. Get the radial saws,

595
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:33,625
thermal lances,
welding machines, and some mops.

596
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,291
And a couple of guns.

597
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:40,666
You guys, keep making those ingots
like there's no tomorrow!

598
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,458
Let's go!

599
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,041
Come on.

600
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:06,541
Get out of your truck
and give me your clothes.

601
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:38,666
<i>Deep down, Berlin
and the Professor were very similar.</i>

602
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,875
<i>They both devised their plans
based upon a single powerful feeling...</i>

603
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:44,916
<i>thrill.</i>

604
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,833
Stop.

605
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,166
<i>The Professor's "thrill"
was to disguise the extraordinary</i>

606
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,291
<i>as something completely mundane.</i>

607
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,750
<i>Like a garbage truck.</i>

608
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:02,541
<i>Berlin's "thrill" was to believe
that the impossible was possible.</i>

609
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,666
<i>The Professor was like
his brother in that sense,</i>

610
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,458
<i>even though he didn't think so.</i>

611
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:10,125
<i>Because only with childlike wonder</i>

612
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:13,875
<i>can someone play hide-and-seek
on a street besieged by soldiers.</i>

613
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,958
A garbage truck is asking for permission
to enter at control point 1-2-6.

614
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:24,458
<i>That attempt to escape,
the most important one ever,</i>

615
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,000
<i>was something Berlin
and Peter Pan would've loved.</i>

616
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:28,125
We're all clear here.

617
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:31,875
<i>It was all or nothing,
and it'd be defined by a magical moment.</i>

618
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:36,000
<i>Just like the moment they realized
the heist was technically possible.</i>

619
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:40,333
<i>It was like knowing how to get to Mars,
but not how to come back.</i>

620
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:44,833
<i>Still, that didn't stop them
from celebrating with enthusiasm</i>

621
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,166
<i>that only children have.</i>

622
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,291
<i>♪ He kissed me in a way
That I wanna be kissed ♪</i>

623
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:54,291

00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,875
<i>ready or not, here I come.</i>

628
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,583
<i>That's how it all happened.</i>

629
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,750
<i>In an instant of crass normalcy.</i>

630
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:17,333
<i>The garbage truck swallowing the trash.</i>

631
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:20,041
<i>But there was a lot more to it than that.</i>

632
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,500
Professor.

633
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:27,541
<i>It was putting the mastermind
behind the heist back where he belonged,</i>

634
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,375
<i>with a new mind by his side.</i>

635
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:31,000
<i>And most importantly...</i>

636
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:39,833
<i>the Professor realized
that his brother's enthusiasm for the plan</i>

637
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,041
<i>had now infected his entire team.</i>

638
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:48,541
<i>That while he had been in a technical KO,
lying on the canvas...</i>

639
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,958
You'll see, Professor.

640
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,333
We did the best we could.

641
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:53,625
That's good.

642
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,583
<i>...the machinery had kept running.</i>

643
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,333
<i>The gold was out,</i>

644
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:02,166
<i>and the stormwater-tank foundry
was in full swing.</i>

645
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,875
<i>The dream was more alive than ever.</i>

646
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:30,916
They did it.

647
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,041
They did it.

648
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,791
Palermo, you did it.

649
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,208
There's a foundry in the stormwater tank.

650
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:49,500
Of course there is, brother!

651
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,958
Isn't it the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

652
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,416
The gold is coming out.

653
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,000
The gold is coming out!

654
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:09,333
This one's for you, Andrés.

655
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:12,416
With a pump this powerful,
they'd hear the sound of the suction,

656
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,833
or pumping, it'd be very easy to assume
we're passing it through the plumbing.

657
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,250
Why wouldn't the police be waiting?

658
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:26,166
That's an excellent question, Sergio,
and we've got the answer to that as well.

659
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,416
And the answer is
the difference between a cat burglar

660
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,708
and us.

661
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:33,541
The difference
between being good and being a genius.

662
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,291
And we only aspire to pure genius.
