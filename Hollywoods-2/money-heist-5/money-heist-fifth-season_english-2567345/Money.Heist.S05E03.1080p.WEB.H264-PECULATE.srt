1
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,750
Three, four.

2
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,291
One, two, three.

3
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,041
One, two, three, four.

4
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,875
Help me!

5
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,208
Get the forceps, the medical kit!
We have to stop the bleeding!

6
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,458
He's got no pulse.

7
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,083
- Let's go!
- On your knees, you son of a bitch!

8
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,750
Please, you can't die on me.

9
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,541
- Come on!
- Coming, coming!

10
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,833
The scissors.

11
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,541
Come on, come on...

12
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,500
Holy shit.

13
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,458
- Ah, fuck.
- Here.

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Get the forceps.
Come on, Arturo.

15
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,708
Three, four.

16
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,875
- Full charge!
- We're clear!

17
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,083
Stop, you're frying a dead body.

18
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,833
- Stockholm.
- Get the epinephrine. Get it.

19
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:53,916
I got it.

20
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,666
You executed him. Accept it.

21
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,708
What are we doing?
The army's about to blow us out of here.

22
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,041
We're clear.

23
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,291
He's got a pulse.

24
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,500
Yes.

25
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank God.

26
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,003
He's got a pulse.

27
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,333
He's got a bullet in his heart.
He's never gonna survive.

28
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,666
We have to get him to a hospital, Palermo.
We need to get him out now!

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,083
He was dead a minute ago

30
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,583
and he'll be dead again
when you stop blowing air into his lungs.

31
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,375
If we get him out,
then we'll become murderers.

32
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,791
- No.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,750
They're gonna break in.
They'll kill the hostages.

34
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,583
- And they'll kill us too.
- We can't just let him die.

35
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,375
- It's my fault.
- Listen to me.

36
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,291
This fucking Goddamn crazy son of a bitch
kept asking for it.

37
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,375
You shot him twice.
You did good. But now you feel guilty.

38
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,750
You want to assuage your guilt
by tossing a bucket of shit on us.

39
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,916
I can't allow that.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You keep your conscience clean.
Mine's already dirty. I'll finish him off.

41
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,791
- No!
- I'm going to shoot him!

42
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,583
- Then it's all over!
- Listen to me.

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,333
Calm down, calm down.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Look at me.

45
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,416
We're getting him out...
and I'll tell you why.

46
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,833
Doctor!

47
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,166
We need a doctor!

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,916
<i>As Stockholm watched Arturo
hanging between life and death,</i>

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,291
<i>she felt like a murderer.</i>

50
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,041
<i>She realized
she'd cut her son's last safety net</i>

51
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,833
<i>and now Cincinnati was on his own.</i>

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,500
<i>After all,
Arturo was the kid's biological father.</i>

53
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,750
<i>It made Stockholm feel certain</i>

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,041
<i>that neither she nor Denver
would ever see Cincinnati again.</i>

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,541
<i>She wasn't the only one feeling
the weight and responsibility</i>

56
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,083
<i>of having a child.</i>

57
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,333
<i>While we wait
for more information from the police,</i>

58
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,875
<i>we have new reports of movement
inside of the Bank of Spain...</i>

59
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:50,000
<i>Our lives depended on three guys
who were tied up and held at gunpoint.</i>

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,416
<i>Under other circumstances,
they would have given up,</i>

61
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,000
<i>but Benjamín had a child inside the bank.</i>

62
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,083
<i>And the Professor had us.</i>

63
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,750
<i>♪ If I stay with you ♪</i>

64
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:24,833

72
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,833
His condition is critical.

73
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,833
I'll be there as soon as possible.

74
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,333
Search these men in my office.

75
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,500
I need to start
the interrogation right away.

76
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,041
Run the electromagnetic detector
over all of them,

77
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,916
they could have mics
in their tooth fillings.

78
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,208
- There's no radioelectric waves.
- Bring them some clothes.

79
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,833
Colonel, they're clean.

80
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,291
There's ten of them.

81
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,166
There's always one with the hostages,
here, in the library.

82
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,041
What happened to Arturo Román?

83
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,625
We tried to bring some hostages to safety...
but he lost his mind.

84
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,708
He was drunk with his power.
He attacked them with a flamethrower.

85
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,916
Mounted the machine gun on a forklift.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,875
He put us all in danger.
They had to take him out.

87
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,083
He had no pulse for a few minutes,
but they resuscitated him.

88
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:09,541
They didn't resuscitate anyone.
They killed him in cold blood.

89
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,791
The best thing that could happen
is for him to die in the next ten minutes.

90
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,791
They gave us a gift and I'll use it
to finish them off. No law, no rights!

91
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,625
We'll shoot them in the back
even if they're on their knees!

92
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,333
But before we do,

93
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,541
I need everyone to believe
they're all fucking murderers.

94
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,416
Are you following?

95
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,125
Anyone else injured?

96
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,291
Two hostages.

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,375
They were injured by Román.

98
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,375
Absolutely not. It was them.

99
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,041
I've been summoned to the Ministry
of the Interior by the president.

100
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,166
No one enters the building
until I get back.

101
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,083
Martínez,
bring the documentation! Martínez!

102
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,666
He would've killed you.

103
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,916
Why am I here?

104
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,250
What am I doing here?

105
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,958
I'm shooting people
while my kid is with some monks.

106
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,291
When he's older...

107
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,666
and he hears about this,
he'll ask about me and...

108
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,541
I don't want him to know who I was.

109
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,541
I've fucked up my son's whole life.

110
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,875
My dad also thinks he fucked up my life,

111
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,375
but I love him to death.

112
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,333
A miner with a trans daughter,
back in the '90s...

113
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,833
He made a ton of mistakes.

114
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:47,750
When I was five, I came up to my dad
and said, "Daddy, I'm a girl. Okay?"

115
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,833
He looked at me
with that serious miner face

116
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:55,625
and said, "Juan, you are a man.
And men cannot be girls."

117
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,541
I saw this makeup case once
and I was crazy about it.

118
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,958
I don't know how many times
I asked him to buy it for me as a gift.

119
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,000
And I did get a case after all, yeah.
But it was a tool case.

120
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,125
Then I just ended up understanding

121
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,541
that anything my dad thought
was girly was bad. So I tried to hide it.

122
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,125
But wasn't there anyone
you could have talked to?

123
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,750
Nobody in our neighborhood.

124
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,250
There were a lot of pickpockets, burglars...

125
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,041
There were junkies, a lot of them.
But there wasn't anyone who was trans.

126
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,750
Back in those days, whenever a man
was dressed up as a woman on TV,

127
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,458
it was just a big joke,
just for people to laugh.

128
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,250
My dad would be the first one to crack up.

129
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,375
But I forgive him now because,
the truth is,

130
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,000
I didn't have any role models,
but neither did he.

131
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,083
I think the natural state of parenthood
is just plain confusion.

132
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,208
And at the end of the day, it's not about
doing everything the right way.

133
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,916
It's about loving.

134
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,250
Do you like your presents?

135
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,458
Are you referring to these gentlemen?

136
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,541
Mm-hmm.

137
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166
They're incredible teachers.

138
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,166
Like authentic, ivy-league professors.

139
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,625
Two brilliant captains
for your first flight.

140
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,208
And we chose, specifically for you,

141
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,083
a robbery with no risk.

142
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,041
Basically, just to enjoy it.

143
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,083
So, can you tell me, Dad,
how come this job has no risk?

144
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,125
It has no risk because no one will notice
they were robbed.

145
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,625
Well...
At some point they'll find out.

146
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,541
No.

147
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,791
Not in a month, not in two, not in three.

148
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,333
Not even ten.

149
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,208
In 15, yeah.
When the Viking gold museum opens.

150
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,458
But by then,
who's gonna connect the dots?

151
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,958
- Viking gold?
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,416
Exact replicas made of brass

153
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,833
of all the pieces

154
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,125
of the biggest Viking treasure hoard
discovered ever.

155
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,666
Eight months ago,
it was found at an archaeological site.

156
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,625
It was cataloged,

157
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,916
and now it's being kept in a secure room
in the Danish National Heritage.

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,833
The real one's there, all locked up,
in limbo, awaiting its destiny.

159
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,708
And do you know
where that security room is?

160
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,375
In the Castle of Frederiksborg.

161
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,750
Exactly the same venue where I'll be
performing a concert in just three days.

162
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,166
<i>It'll be the perfect evening.</i>

163
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,958
<i>Luxury cars, tuxedos, cocktails...</i>

164
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,041
...<i>classical music...</i>

165
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,166
<i>and 12 kilos of gold.</i>

166
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,541
What's so funny?

167
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,625
First of all,

168
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,666
these are Viking burial gifts,
not a Viking treasure.

169
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,250
That's the correct term
archaeologists use.

170
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,125
And secondly, um, you're a total cynic.

171
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,250
Dad, you come across
as a person that you know is fond of art

172
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
and restores monasteries.

173
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,250
I'm sorry, I gotta say it.
These pieces belong in a museum.

174
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,500
Wait a minute. Are you calling this art?

175
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,958
- Really?
- Of course I am.

176
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,791
These pieces are more
than 1,000 years old.

177
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,208
They're hand carved.
They have Nordic mythology symbols.

178
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,166
- This is pure art!
- Any blacksmith could make this garbage!

179
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,083
This is the coarseness of barbarians!

180
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:02,375
Those people pillaged iconic pieces,
extraordinary ones:

181
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,250
Latin, Greek, Phoenician,

182
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,416
and then melted them
for their cups of wine, plates, amulets!

183
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,375
We're giving the dignity
back to this gold.

184
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,458
Oh, for God's sake.

185
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,916
We're the ones
who are going to make art.

186
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,250
This heist will be unforgettable.

187
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,416
<i>Imminent press conference
from the Ministry of the Interior.</i>

188
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,708
<i>Luis Tamayo, colonel in charge,
will speak in just a moment.</i>

189
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,375
<i>Until then, here's an update
on Arturo Román's condition...</i>

190
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,578
You almost kill
the only hostage people know.

191
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,083
On top of that,
you release the governor from the bank.

192
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,666
Hello? Anyone still at the wheel in there?

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,750
Here's the situation, the army's going in.

194
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,083
They're waiting for Tamayo
to destroy you guys,

195
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,916
and he'll do it, for two reasons.
First, he's an asshole and a coward.

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
Second, you're making it so easy for him.

197
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,125
<i>- We'll find out soon.
- Are hostages being executed?</i>

198
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,083
<i>And, is the army getting ready
for an intervention?</i>

199
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,708
You're shooting hostages.
The public is gonna go crazy.

200
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,291
Your girlfriend,

201
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,833
the Power Ranger you love so much,

202
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,250
the teddy bear from the Balkans,
the kid from the grave...

203
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,791
All those people
you're willing to die for.

204
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,291
Your people, they're...

205
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,083
already dead.

206
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,833
But I can stop all of that.

207
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,958
You give me the information,

208
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,250
I pick up the phone
and nobody dies, Sergio.

209
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,583
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR

210
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,333
Please, move to the sides.
Move to the sides!

211
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:51,750
Good morning.

212
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,291
We brought you here today
to this press conference

213
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,833
to fill you in
on all the latest information

214
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,625
regarding the disappearance
of Alicia Sierra.

215
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,083
Former Inspector Alicia Sierra
has betrayed the police force

216
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,708
and she has now begun collaborating
with the Professor.

217
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:11,000
<i>We currently have no information regarding
her whereabouts after she fled the city.</i>

218
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,500
<i>But we're using all the means
at our disposal to bring her to justice.</i>

219
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,875
She looked like this when she disappeared.

220
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,083
A security camera from a store
close to her home captured this image.

221
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,000
Son of a bitch.

222
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,833
We traced her cell phone's
last registered location

223
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,875
to within two blocks
of the National Court.

224
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,791
A safe house has been located

225
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,958
where she might have coordinated
Murillo's evacuation.

226
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,333
<i>All this is currently under investigation.</i>

227
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,708
Forensic analysis
regarding the equipment found at her house

228
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,791
suggests that she leaked
email conversations

229
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,916
regarding the events in Algeria.

230
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,958
<i>She organized the depositions</i>

231
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,458
<i>as well as the broadcasting
of Aníbal Cortés' fake burial.</i>

232
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,291
<i>We've also found encrypted traces
of communication with underground servers.</i>

233
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:59,583
<i>Through them, Alicia Sierra leaked
sensitive information to the Professor.</i>

234
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:05,041
<i>In the last few hours, we've learned that
Alicia Sierra received eight million euros</i>

235
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,041
<i>deposited to various shell companies</i>

236
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,416
<i>in Panama, Belize, and Delaware.</i>

237
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,916
What did you expect?
There's no going back now and no way out.

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,833
I'll find a way out.

239
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,000
Now, does anybody have any questions?

240
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,875
Colonel, please!

241
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,375
And what about Arturo Román?

242
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,416
He's in critical condition,
doesn't look good.

243
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,625
Now, it's too late.

244
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:33,625
The police, the CNI, the government...
All of them fabricated evidence.

245
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,250
If you turn us in, they'll say
first you betrayed them and then us.

246
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,000
Shut it. Just shut up.

247
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,625
Do you really think they'll admit
they created fake evidence?

248
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,291
The CNI doesn't back down or apologize.
You know that perfectly well.

249
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,833
Shut up.

250
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,000
Are you planning an intervention?

251
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,458
As you can see,
the situation has drastically changed.

252
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,291
This is no longer a robbery with hostages.
It's a kidnapping with executions.

253
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,458
- The protocols are completely different.
- Is that why the army's been mobilized?

254
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,083
I'm sorry. I can't provide any details.
The operation is ongoing.

255
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,708
That's the green light right there.

256
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,750
It's going to be a total massacre.
They're going to go in now.

257
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,333
How are they getting the gold out?

258
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,833
I don't even know
how they're gonna get the gold out.

259
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:18,916
The gold.

260
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,375
- It's not important.
- Of course it's important, idiot.

261
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,333
You're absolutely clueless.
The gold is not important.

262
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,083
- Shut up.
- They signed your sentence.

263
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,458
They charged you with the same crimes
we were charged, maybe even worse.

264
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,267
- Shut up.
- Because yours includes contempt.

265
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,125
- Shut up.
- Now you're nothing but a traitor.

266
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,226
- Shut up.
- To the police,

267
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,416
to the government,
to all of your colleagues...

268
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,041
- Shut up.
- Nothing can save you from going to jail.

269
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,583
Shut your mouth! I need to think!

270
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,541
No. No.

271
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,708
Her water broke.

272
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,375
Not now.

273
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,125
Not now, not now, not now.

274
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,375
Be reasonable, no?
You can't raise a child in prison.

275
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,375
I can raise a child
in prison perfectly well.

276
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,750
Maternity ward. That's how you do it.

277
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,791
<i>Hey, Godfather...</i>

278
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,166
I'm grateful you brought me into this.

279
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,708
I really needed it.

280
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,833
Sweetie, if you needed money,
you just had to call us.

281
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,208
What I needed
was someone to believe in me.

282
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,833
She's talking about her dad, Papa.

283
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,375
For fuck's sake,
I know she's talking about her dad.

284
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,138
My dad thinks I can't be a robber anymore,

285
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,500
but actually,
I can do it now better than ever.

286
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,500
You gotta study.
We're going to print two billion bucks.

287
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,666
Like this: peekeepee, peekeepee...

288
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,250
You... You told your father
you're here, right?

289
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,500
I didn't and I never will.

290
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,958
Yeah.

291
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,541
So, uh, we need to go to bed.

292
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,875
Tomorrow we have shooting practice
and... yeah. Come on.

293
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,458
- Buenas noches.
- Good night.

294
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Dani.

295
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,875
Kiddo!

296
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,166
- Wake up, man! Hey!
- What happened? What happened?

297
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,291
I think we might be getting
something wrong here.

298
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,583
What are you talking about, Papa, it's...

299
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,166
Papa, it's five in the morning!
Why are you even up right now?

300
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
Maybe we didn't understand

301
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,208
the way Benjamín
wanted us to look after, uh, Julia

302
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,750
and we're screwing this up.

303
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,125
We're not screwing anything up.
Julia wants to be here.

304
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,583
And Julia... she's a grown-up woman,

305
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,583
with all her things,
with her independence.

306
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,375
Even if she wants to do it,
I'm still supposed to tell Benjamín

307
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,791
that maybe I took her off of a good path.

308
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,166
And you know,
maybe what's a good path for me

309
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,875
is not the same as a good or a bad path
that Benjamín has in his head.

310
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,875
So, we should fix this, true up,
before we take her to a war zone.

311
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,083
Papa, Benjamín's in jail
and we can't do anything about it

312
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,916
'cause we don't even have a phone.

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,250
We just need to move on. So good night.

314
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,791
Come on, just get up!
I... I... I have to call him.

315
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,125
So you wanna go call him
in jail right now?

316
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,958
What do you mean?

317
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,291
We have to walk for three or four hours
just to find a phone so...

318
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,500
- I'm not going anywhere.
- What do you mean?

319
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,583
- God.
- Come on.

320
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,000
- Damn it, now I can't go back to sleep.
- So get up.

321
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,708
Cover that C4 with steel sheets.
You don't wanna blow your head off.

322
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,291
<i>Our defense strategy
was to move the weapons to a safe place.</i>

323
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,333
Take seven more.

324
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,041
Rio, grenades?

325
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,375
- Six.
- Take as many as you can, brother.

326
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,208
<i>But rather than a bunker,</i>

327
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,541
<i>it felt like
we were digging our own graves.</i>

328
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,250
We can do this.

329
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,708
<i>Without the Professor,
we felt like orphans.</i>

330
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,166
This is our last dance, Fatty.
Make it a good one.

331
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,958
<i>No father, no plan, no hope.</i>

332
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,833
Pardon the soccer reference,
it's appropriate for the circumstances.

333
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,041
Sometimes, during the World Cup finals,
you know which team is gonna lose

334
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,916
by the look of fear in the players' faces
as they sing the anthem.

335
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,375
And that type of fear
is what I'm seeing here, right now.

336
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,083
But that's all about to change.

337
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,833
In soccer it's 11 against 11.

338
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,041
We're ten against 10,000 without a coach.

339
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,125
Ding, ding, ding!

340
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,041
Attention all the robbers
currently at the Bank of Spain.

341
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,208
Breaking news just arriving
straight from the stormwater tank:

342
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,541
Alicia Sierra no longer plays
for the police.

343
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,916
Tamayo dethroned her, left her on her own.

344
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,875
Sierra's playing solo.
You know what that means, don't you?

345
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,958
Care to guess?

346
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,166
Tokyo, Rio? Do you know?

347
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,625
The Professor hasn't lost just yet.

348
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,750
He's playing his own match
and still could win.

349
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,208
He's playing against a nutcase.

350
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,583
No. She's more than that.

351
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:13,083
She's also really pissed off,
because she was just betrayed

352
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,833
and thrown to the lions.

353
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,416
Right now she knows
the Professor's not her biggest enemy.

354
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,791
- Breathe with your diaphragm.
- What?

355
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,291
So... So you control the contractions.

356
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,708
- Breathe with your diaphragm.
- Now you're a midwife too?

357
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,083
We can't win this war.

358
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,416
Ding, ding, ding!

359
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,708
The bear from the Balkans
gets it wrong again.

360
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,916
We don't need to win this war.
In fact, we're going to lose it...

361
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,208
but at a slow pace.

362
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,083
And you...

363
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,208
my boys and girls in red...

364
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,916
We... We're the fucking dregs of society,

365
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,166
a team with the biggest losers in history:

366
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,375
trans, criminals, scumbags, gays,

367
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,458
Balkans, Latinos... What the fuck
can they teach us about losing?

368
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,166
We know the terrible feeling
of a slow defeat.

369
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,250
We know it.

370
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,375
So it's just another day as losers.

371
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,500
And why do we wanna be losers again?

372
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,041
So we can melt the gold
and take it all out, brother.

373
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,166
Get back at it.

374
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,458
Sounds fucking good to me.

375
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,750
So you've got a losing plan
that you're not telling us about.

376
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,916
Of course I do.

377
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,958
I graduated as an engineer,

378
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,375
but my vocation
is a general in the infantry.

379
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,750
I need to dilate.

380
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,916
Some... oxytocin... would be great.

381
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,125
Unfortunately, we don't have any...

382
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,666
- Something for the pain.
- No, no, no. You'll put the baby at risk.

383
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,291
Holy shit!

384
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,750
We don't stand a chance at open warfare,

385
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,583
but in these rooms
their advantage disappears.

386
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,583
We're gonna crawl through every nook,
every corner,

387
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,208
every fucking pile of rubble.

388
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,458
We'll throw a grenade, then a second one,
followed by machine-gun fire.

389
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,208
This isn't a fucking Vietnam movie.

390
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,875
Exactly, it's much worse.
It's the defense of Stalingrad.

391
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,458
This strategy is not mine,
it's Vasily Chuikov's.

392
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,625
We're gonna blast music so loud
they won't hear our grenades fall,

393
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,250
they won't hear the explosions.
And what's better...

394
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,375
they won't even hear their own radios.

395
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,375
Alicia, listen to me.

396
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,875
Now you can no longer go to a hospital.

397
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,291
And you can't do it on your own.

398
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,125
You have to release us. You need our help.

399
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,541
- Let us help you.
- I'm gonna give birth...

400
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,666
alone.

401
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,625
Same way my grandma did,

402
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:56,666
and hundreds of other women
throughout history.

403
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,291
Like this!

404
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:07,166
Welcome to the spectacle of life!

405
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,208
I need three volunteers
and the mission won't be easy.

406
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,583
Those three people
will have to advance from the rear.

407
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:16,583
Our only chance
is to attack them from both fronts.

408
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,000
We need to move as fast as lightning.

409
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,583
Go through the elevator shaft
or the air ducts,

410
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,833
whatever, just be fucking fast.

411
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,625
Logroño.

412
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:33,458
You know more than him. How's my dilation?

413
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,916
Mm, I couldn't tell you.

414
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,583
Dilation is measured by touch.

415
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,583
Let's see.

416
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,000
What part of the plan is this?

417
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,833
The birth plan!

418
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,458
Three volunteers and, folks,

419
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,500
remember you're the most exposed, okay?

420
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,708
Good. Let's do it.

421
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,500
Let's go, come on!

422
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Denver,

423
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,958
say goodbye to her.

424
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:15,291
It'll be a long night.
And this might be our final one.

425
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,791
Are we seriously gonna walk
the whole way?

426
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,250
It's five in the morning,
how else can we go?

427
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,208
Shit, maybe stealing a car.

428
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,041
There you go. Stealing, huh?

429
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,541
The first thing
that goes through your mind, right?

430
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,708
The smallest hitch comes...
Boom, let's steal.

431
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,601
You're one to talk. You brought to me
to steal the money-making factory.

432
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,625
So you'll learn to do it intelligently,
like the Professor.

433
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,333
He knows how to do it right.

434
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,583
You steal big in one go,

435
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,666
not in small amounts
and screwing people over.

436
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,041
Yeah, but it's 5:00 a.m.
Leaving now, we'll be back by 11:00 a.m.

437
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,916
If we come back to the Professor,
what are you gonna tell him?

438
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,708
See? You start using your head
and suddenly you make sense.

439
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,000
We'll steal a car.

440
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,541
But let's steal it
from someone who won't say anything.

441
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,208
- Hey!
- Almost there.

442
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,583
Come on. Let's go.

443
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,550
I don't know
what you want me to say.

444
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,708
What can I say
that you don't know already?

445
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,250
You know, there's always some risk.

446
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,583
The job is... It's huge.

447
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,208
It was calculated down to the millimeters.
I promise.

448
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:46,166
If something goes wrong, Julia will go
to a prison for men and I don't...

449
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,041
I don't even want to imagine it.

450
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,916
Yeah, but... she could ask
for a transfer for a women's prison,

451
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
which I'm sure they'll allow.

452
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,500
Julia's been through a big journey
to be where she is now.

453
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,833
She's...

454
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,125
She's starting to live.

455
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:06,166
She's happy. I'd never seen
my daughter so happy in...

456
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,083
<i>In 30 years.</i>

457
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:13,291
She's been in jail all her life.
Don't put her back there.

458
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,750
If the job is as big as you say,
how can you look after her?

459
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:24,375
Of course I will.
As if she's my daughter.

460
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,333
Benjamín, listen,

461
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,208
I'm on Julia's side to death,
you understand?

462
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,916
And I'll always be. To death!

463
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,125
Thanks, Dani.

464
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,083
Yeah, don't mention it.

465
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,500
I gotta go.

466
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,916
Ah... big hug.

467
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,916
Wow. You went a little too far there, no?

468
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,916
Did I?

469
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,500
Let's get out of here.

470
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,750
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

471
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,250
Coming.

472
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:08,875
That phone call
is irreversible.

473
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,041
Think about it for a second, please.

474
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,583
That call is a death sentence
for you and your child.

475
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:20,000
You can hate me if you want.
You can wish me dead if you want.

476
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,416
Whatever. But, unfortunately, right now,

477
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,041
to save your life and your child,
you need to save mine.

478
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,083
At this very moment,
we're in the same place, we're equals.

479
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,250
You and I aren't equals,
you piece of shit.

480
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:34,166
You're here to break the law.
I'm here to stop you.

481
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,875
Jesus.

482
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:42,458
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

483
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,666
You're sentencing your child.

484
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,000
They'll destroy you
because they don't owe you anything.

485
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,083
My life.

486
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,041
They owe me my life.

487
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:03,500
I've turned into
the regional queen of bitches for them.

488
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,541
And you don't let bitches like me down.

489
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,500
- I will not let you down.
- Shut up.

490
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,541
I'll never let you down.

491
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,875
Don't talk to me like I'm one of you.

492
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,666
I won't spend my life on the run,
especially now.

493
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,041
I don't run away.

494
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,041
I don't hide.

495
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,500
I don't go to the Philippines.
I don't go to the Philippines.

496
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,875
I actually liked my life.

497
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,791
I like Madrid. And lamb chops.

498
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,916
And the Puerta del Sol.
And the corruption.

499
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:44,875
And I'm not losing my fucking country
because of you, asshole.

500
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,125
You were betrayed by Tamayo, not me.

501
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,875
I hate you.

502
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,833
Very well. But we're currently
running out of time

503
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,375
and your hatred towards me

504
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,416
does not entitle you
to put this child's life at risk.

505
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,541
This child...

506
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:06,208
adores risk, you son of a bitch!

507
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,958
Fuck!

508
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,666
With me.

509
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,625
Tamayo just got back.

510
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,791
Some soldiers are going in with him.

511
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,291
Did the Professor call?

512
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,541
If he did, I would have informed you.

513
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,833
Everyone out now!

514
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:59,833
We're about to prepare
a military operation in here! Let's go!

515
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:11,041
Police officers
are coming out of the tent.

516
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,583
Looks like they're organizing.

517
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,791
<i>Copy.
That means only a few minutes.</i>

518
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,125
When you shoot someone,
you feel like shit, you know?

519
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,416
You hate yourself for it.

520
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,666
I shot you.

521
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,916
And to think
that something could've happened.

522
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,000
To think that I could be a murderer.

523
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:45,083
You think, "All that's left
is either jail or death."

524
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:47,666
But it's not.

525
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,833
It's not like that.

526
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,333
I treated your wound.

527
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,791
I danced.

528
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,791
And from that moment on,
we've actually we've been happy, Mónica.

529
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:06,750
Just 'cause it happened once
doesn't mean it'll happen now.

530
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:10,625
Actually,

531
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,541
maybe all of us have just run out of luck.

532
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,041
I think we need to talk when you get back.

533
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:26,875
If I come back.

534
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,708
In that case, we should kiss.

535
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,666
For the first time.

536
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,583
A first kiss only happens once.

537
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,583
Maybe you don't get it.
That's why it's called that.

538
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,791
But I don't wanna give you a last kiss.
I want another first kiss.

539
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,125
The kind of kiss couples do
when they get back together.

540
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,041
I want that.

541
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,583
The building is shielded.

542
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,750
Which means there aren't many
entrance points for us to choose from.

543
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,333
The main entrance,

544
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,833
loading bays,

545
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:47,416
or windows.

546
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,125
But... those are the exact spots
where they'll be expecting us,

547
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,250
so none of them are an option.

548
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,041
But there's one more possibility.

549
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,875
You already know Captain Gandía,

550
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,625
former green beret.

551
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:02,458
I had the honor to serve with him
and some of you have too.

552
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,708
He's proposing an alternative plan.

553
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,708
The rooftop. In the plans,
everything is shielded.

554
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,166
However, there's one area that's clear.

555
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,833
It's confidential information.
They ignore it.

556
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:17,208
What did you say? There's a hole
in the shield of the Bank of Spain?

557
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,125
No. It's completely shielded.

558
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,416
But it starts at the museum.

559
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,125
It shuts down with steel doors,
like the ones on the first floor.

560
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,250
So we're gonna climb up there,

561
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,916
we're gonna blow this up, and we'll drop
straight into the dining hall.

562
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,916
That ceiling
was constructed in the 18th century.

563
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,583
It was brought from a palace in Jaén

564
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,125
during the Civil War
to protect it from the bombings.

565
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:41,291
Hold on, Ángel,
do you think someone in Bosnia said,

566
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,666
"Don't blow the Mostar Bridge,
it's an antique"?

567
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,708
No, and there it is, rebuilt.

568
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,458
What about the Sarajevo Library?

569
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,625
They burned down Berlin
during World War II,

570
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:52,666
and nobody said, "Don't bomb
this neighborhood, it's very beautiful."

571
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,333
There are Goya paintings in there,
the Quimbaya gold...

572
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,583
We've got Amnesty International
on our backs.

573
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,541
You wanna pick a fight
with UNESCO as well?

574
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,125
You don't give a shit
about the Quimbayas.

575
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:07,125
You stare at me like I'm a monster.
Can you just say what is on your mind?

576
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,250
You ruined the life of an innocent person.
You set her up to go to prison.

577
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:14,375
Just so you know,
a country's security is above the honor

578
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,418
of a particular individual,
it's above everything!

579
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,166
The National Reserve
is a country's backbone.

580
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,416
Are you really saying
that Sierra's dignity

581
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,625
is more important
than the safety of 47 million people?

582
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:25,708
You're full of shit!

583
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,583
You did that to save yourself,

584
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:30,416
not to save the <i>security</i>
of 47 million people.

585
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,458
We'll go in by making
that fucking ceiling fly!

586
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,208
Come on, baby!
Just a little more and you'll be out!

587
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:02,000
Fuck!

588
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,541
It won't come out! It won't come out!

589
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,208
It won't... It won't... Why?

590
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,500
Because it isn't the head.

591
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,666
What? What?

592
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,000
It's a breech baby.

593
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,083
What?

594
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,666
Now what?

595
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,083
You need to insert the hand...

596
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:23,375
...place the baby
on your arm as if it were riding it,

597
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:27,208
hold its mouth with your index and thumb,
bring its head close to the breastbone,

598
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,375
and then pull it out.

599
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,458
There's no other way.
And you need to do it right now.

600
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,291
You have to release me.

601
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,416
A convoy just left the tent.

602
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:57,250
Copy that.
Everyone in position. Lisbon?

603
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:00,916
We're ready.

604
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,416
- <i>Tokyo?</i>
- I'm in.

605
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,791
Matías, code red.

606
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,166
All right, nobody moves!

607
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,458
Head between your legs.
Brace yourself with your arms.

608
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,791
Like in a fucking airplane!

609
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:31,958
We're gonna have some turbulence.

610
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,666
Change of plans!
No matter what happens up there,

611
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,333
no matter what you hear,
or if everything's shaking,

612
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:02,166
don't stop melting!

613
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,875
If the Virgin Mary appears
in front of you dancing to reggaeton,

614
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:07,083
don't stop melting.

615
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,750
- <i>Bogotá?</i>
- Coming.

616
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,250
Ah.

617
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,916
If anyone's thinking
of taking a little bit of gold

618
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,791
to make earrings for their grandma...

619
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,041
No.

620
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,083
When we're outside,
just come and ask Papa.

621
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,416
Got it, kiddos?

622
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,000
Let's get to work!

623
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,250
- Let's do it!
- Let's get melting!

624
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,000
They're heading southwest.

625
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:45,875
Jesus.

626
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,791
Marseille, blankets.

627
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,458
Benjamín, clean water.

628
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,958
Let's go! Everyone down!

629
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,041
Move it!

630
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,083
Let's go, everyone down!

631
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,416
Come on! Down!

632
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,916
They're in a blind spot.

633
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,875
If they're in a blind spot,
then they're climbing.

634
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,625
They're gonna blow the roof!

635
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,916
Tokyo, Denver, Manila, get out of there!
Go to the stairs!

636
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:55,666
Ready!

637
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,291
Launch!

638
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,666
Listen carefully.

639
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,208
Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.

640
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,166
That's it.

641
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,791
This is really important.
You can't push now.

642
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,083
I'm going to put my hand in.

643
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,416
- Okay?
- Okay.

644
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,333
Okay.

645
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,250
It'll be okay.

646
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,500
It'll be okay.

647
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,625
Let's do it.

648
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,333
- Tokyo, situation.
- We're on the second floor.

649
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,333
Third floor.

650
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:00,096
All the way to the roof, you gotta
catch them from behind. Helsinki?

651
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,708
I need to build a trench here.

652
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,000
Retreat to the museum. Wait for me there.

653
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,750
I can't. This doesn't work.

654
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,750
Please! Please...

655
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,458
Come on.

656
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,333
A little more.

657
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,250
The breastbone. I got the breastbone.

658
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,833
Come on, please...

659
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,500
Almost there.

660
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,458
I'm pulling it out.

661
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,833
A little more, just a little.

662
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,250
Get out of the dining hall.
Take shelter in the museum.

663
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,000
Negative.

664
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,625
Come on, almost there.

665
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,375
Almost there!

666
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,416
Take cover.

667
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,458
We've witnessed an explosion...

668
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,791
LIVE
EXPLOSION AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

669
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,163
<i>It looks like they're planning
to enter the building.</i>
