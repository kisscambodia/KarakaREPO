1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,500
René!

2
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,333
René!

3
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,125
No!

4
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,333
René!

5
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,458
<i> Three people were killed
after an attempted robbery</i>

6
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,458
<i>of a bank branch in east Madrid.</i>

7
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,916
<i>According to early reports,</i>

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,541
<i>at least one of the robbers
was able to escape.</i>

9
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:45,583
<i>Suspect is described by witnesses
as a female around 25 to 30 years old.</i>

10
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,583
Sergio, come look at this!

11
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,546
<i>...despite a large police presence.</i>

12
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,791
<i> Two of the victims
were security guards.</i>

13
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,833
<i>One of the robbers, a 30-year-old male,</i>

14
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:59,250
<i>whose identity is still unconfirmed,
is also reportedly deceased.</i>

15
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,666
<i>The police are looking for
the young female who escaped</i>

16
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,625
<i>and have announced that she is
medium height, brunette, and thin.</i>

17
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,708
<i>The state security
and police forces</i>

18
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,666
<i>have set up roadblocks
along all highways exiting Madrid.</i>

19
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,833
<i>They warn that the suspect
is armed and dangerous.</i>

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,666
We should find her.
That's exactly the talent we can use.

21
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,833
I see it.

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,708
She's the most wanted person in Madrid.

23
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,375
I don't think it's a good idea
to involve such a decoy.

24
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,500
Four people with guns.
Three are killed, one is not.

25
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,583
What else do you need? It's clear.

26
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,291
That woman is a survivor.

27
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,541
And now she's a murderer as well.

28
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,041
And that heist was a mess.

29
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,708
She was hanging from the ceiling
like Spider-Man. Who does that?

30
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,726
<i>Instead of leaving those cops
tied up in the parking lot,</i>

31
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,208
<i>she took them into the patrol car</i>

32
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,541
<i>and got past the entire blockade
with the sirens on.</i>

33
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,041
She got away like a queen,
riding on the back of the police.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,708
Is it or is it not art?

35
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,125
Look, Sergio.

36
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,208
I just got out of prison,

37
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,875
and I can assure you
that there are only numbskulls in there.

38
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,791
People with virtually no brain waves, hmm?
With no talent at all.

39
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,083
What we just saw is

40
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,125
unique.

41
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,750
You don't find that easily.

42
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Maybe.

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,416
Maybe she's talented. She <i>is </i>talented.
But that girl is too dangerous.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,708
Exactly right, that's why.

45
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,083
Even more, she's got nothing to lose.

46
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,500
That's exactly what we need.

47
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,708
<i>...police presence was heavy.</i>

48
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,541
<i>Around the same time,
a patrol car was reported missing,</i>

49
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,083
<i>which is possibly related
to the suspect's evasion</i>

50
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,583
<i>of the officers on the scene.</i>

51
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,125
<i>The police are searching
for a young female who fled the bank</i>

52
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,541
<i>after a failed heist...</i>

53
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,083
In 72 hours if the police don't find her,
we'll start looking for her.

54
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,416
<i>...be aware that she is
medium height, brunette, and thin.</i>

55
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,291
- I'm going to the library.
- Okay.

56
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,000
Uh, bring some pastries from San Onofre!

57
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,666
<i> Silene Oliveira.</i>

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,958
<i>That was my name when this story began.</i>

59
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,125
<i>Back when I was convinced
I could outrun the pain,</i>

60
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,375
<i>and the police.</i>

61
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,416
<i>Run,</i>

62
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,458
<i>close your eyes,</i>

63
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,291
<i>and endure.</i>

64
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,458
<i> But eventually,
there comes a moment when you stop.</i>

65
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,208
<i>And all that pain washes over you.</i>

66
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,125
<i> And you feel like there's nothing
you can do to make it disappear.</i>

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,625
<i> I spent ten days hiding,</i>

68
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:42,000
<i>replaying in my head each and every moment
I'd shared with René.</i>

69
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,625
<i> Remembering how he always said
he didn't wanna hit a bank.</i>

70
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,541
<i> And that we decided
to do the job anyway.</i>

71
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,750
<i>And just like that... my pain grew stronger.</i>

72
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,125
<i> And so did the grief.</i>

73
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,625
<i>For leaving him on his own.</i>

74
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,208
<i>Lying on that cold street, soaking wet.</i>

75
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>Of course, he couldn't even feel it.</i>

76
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,583
<i>I knew I had to run faster
than ever before.</i>

77
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,333
<i>So the grief couldn't catch me.</i>

78
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,833
<i> And I didn't stop.</i>

79
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,208
<i>Not even when I got to that dead end,</i>

80
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,125
<i>with an army at our back,
hell-bent on killing us.</i>

81
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,666
<i>At this point in my life,</i>

82
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,458
<i>I was never gonna drop my gun
and make it easy for them.</i>

83
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,250
Take cover!

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,458
Fire!

85
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,666
We're inside of a fucking rattrap!

86
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,041
- We need something to block the door!
- And how the fuck do we do that?

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,208
The countertop!

88
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,875
Tokyo, cover us!

89
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,791
Fire!

90
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,250
Arteche, take down that door!

91
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,573
Hurry!

92
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,333
Son of a bitch!

93
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,166
We have to lift this thing, okay? Hey!

94
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,708
Three.

95
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,000
Two.

96
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,583
One. Let's go!

97
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,708
Tokyo!

98
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,375
Tokyo!

99
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,458
I got it!

100
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,375
It's a grenade!

101
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,208
Push!

102
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,583
Hey, you, in the kitchen!

103
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:43,333
Next time, throw it with a little <i>queso</i>!

113

LISBON, PORTUGAL, FOUR YEARS UNTIL D-DAY

114
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,833
When I was young and I got back
from summer break, I used to think,

115
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,583
"One day I'll grow up and I won't ever
have to go back to school."

116
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,625
Now I don't have to go back there.

117
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,958
I have to go back to something worse.

118
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,750
Why can't we just stay here?

119
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,666
Because vacations have to end, baby.

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,958
You know, seeing you in our neighborhood
is just as good.

121
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,750
I'm always happy when we take
our little walks around Madrid

122
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,541
and have a cold beer in the square.

123
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,875
Come on, it's like we're royalty.

124
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,375
We spend our days working our asses off,

125
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,750
wondering if we can
turn on the heating or not.

126
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,416
You? You spend your days breaking
your back carrying those gas canisters.

127
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,541
Right.

128
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,791
And me, I'm always looking
for another shitty job.

129
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,333
I want to enjoy you all the time.

130
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,791
In that case,
we need to rob something bigger.

131
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,291
Because you don't just want money
to buy things.

132
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,375
You want money to be free.

133
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,000
Freedom's expensive.

134
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
That's what I want.

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,041
Our freedom.

136
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,833
Why should we have to settle for less?

137
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,291
If we don't steal,
our lives are stolen from us.

138
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,166
What do you think?

139
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,000
I think I want to go
around the world with you.

140
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,041
- And I want to see you on a desert island...
- Mm...

141
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,125
- ...in the middle of nowhere...
- Mm...

142
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,708
- ...with two mojitos in your hands...
- Mm...

143
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,375
...and say, "Fuck, I'm so lucky."

144
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,625
If we have all this luck,
then we should...

145
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,625
take advantage of it, right?

146
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,958
Name a city.

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,166
Somewhere far.

148
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,500
I promise I'll take you there.

149
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,833
Tokyo.

150
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,541
Japan won't know what hit 'em.

151
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,188
<i> The first time I chose Tokyo,</i>

152
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,666
<i>it was to travel with René
to the farthest city I could think of.</i>

153
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:15,000
<i> I was the happiest I'd ever been
exploring our love in new cities.</i>

154
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,416
Saint Anthony.

155
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,875
<i> The second time I picked Tokyo
was to change my life.</i>

156
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,500
They're using
the stove countertop as cover.

157
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,416
They have a good shooting angle...

158
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,708
...and good aim.

159
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,458
Cañizo, this is Sagasta.

160
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,291
They're in the kitchen.

161
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,375
<i>Find an angle to shoot from the outside.</i>

162
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,791
Sniper unit in position.

163
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,250
Let's throw grenades, blow their
fortification away, and then burst in.

164
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,333
Let's just go!

165
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,958
Anyone sneaking in that corridor
is a dead man.

166
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,250
Besides, grenades won't do
anything for us.

167
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,625
The stove is made of cast iron
and I'm sure it's locked in place.

168
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,708
What do you propose?

169
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,750
We just sit here and wait for them
to feel like taking a leak?

170
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,541
What we'll do is drill that wall.

171
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,333
We open a path
and we go in from the pantry.

172
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,875
That'll take us ten minutes
at the very least,

173
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,708
and our only advantage is time.

174
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,750
We have to go in now before
they escape the museum and surround us.

175
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,958
That's a negative.

176
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,833
Push harder,
God damn it. Come on!

177
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,791
I got it!

178
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,458
All right.

179
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,750
Can you hack this shit or what, Rio?

180
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,375
Yeah, I'm starting it right now.

181
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,416
It'll take at least 30 minutes.
Realistically, one hour.

182
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
One hour?

183
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,125
What? No, that's too much.

184
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,333
We need the smelters here right now.

185
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,833
First-aid kit.

186
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:25,833
<i>Bogotá.</i>

187
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,375
<i>How long do you need
to cut through the door?</i>

188
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,125
No more than 11 minutes,
as long as there's enough gas.

189
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,541
We have to decide.
The system will lock when we cut.

190
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,125
<i>We'll be shut out.</i>

191
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,208
Bogotá,
get up there with the smelters.

192
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,125
Copy.

193
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,583
- Can you handle it?
- Of course.

194
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,000
Come on, Helsinki. Come on, you can do it.

195
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,375
Jesus.

196
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,458
Tokyo, how long can you hold your ground?

197
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,916
As long as you need.

198
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,375
Start drilling.
Canalejas, give him a hand.

199
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,625
Major, you don't have any fucking clue
what you're doing here.

200
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,166
Captain, you know what we're gonna do?

201
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,416
Exactly what I just told you.
And you're gonna shut your mouth.

202
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,208
- <i> What's going on?</i>
- They're arguing, Professor.

203
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,500
<i>The guy in charge wants to drill the wall
and go through the pantry.</i>

204
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,875
<i>Gandía wants to attack
through the corridor.</i>

205
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,583
Gandía's questioning orders.
Tokyo, that's their weak point.

206
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,291
- <i>You know him, can you do something?</i>
- Sure.

207
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,375
Then do it.

208
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,666
Hello, Gandía.

209
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,500
How are you, sweetie?

210
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,500
Did you miss me?

211
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,333
Only late at night.

212
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,416
But you didn't come back for me, did you?

213
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,166
You're back
because you felt like a little traitor.

214
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,958
You partnered up with the robbers
using a walkie.

215
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,958
You lied to the CNI,
and thanks to that, Lisbon got in.

216
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,458
That's why you're back.

217
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,208
Because you don't have the <i>cojones</i>
to go back home

218
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,250
and look your wife
and your son Juanito in the eyes.

219
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,083
Listen, you filthy rat.

220
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,125
I'm gonna go in there
and wash your mouth out with soap

221
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,875
if you say anything else about my family.

222
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,958
No.

223
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,458
Here's what happened.
See, they saw you coming out alive on TV.

224
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,500
I'm sure they cried,
they hugged each other,

225
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,458
and thought you'd be coming home
in time for dinner.

226
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,583
But no.

227
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,833
Wait, did you even call them?

228
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,916
Of course not.

229
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,583
What would you have said?

230
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,208
"I executed a defenseless woman,

231
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,416
and then I turned myself in and betrayed
my people because I'm a coward"?

232
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,375
Gandía, stay calm.

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,666
"Hi, Juanito, my boy.
You know what?"

234
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,833
"Daddy's a piece of shit."

235
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,541
"Why? Because I'd rather
go get myself killed

236
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,291
than stay home
and read you a bedtime story."

237
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,833
- What are you doing?
- Captain, don't.

238
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,833
Do you hear me, Captain?

239
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,000
"And tell Mama..."

240
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,458
That's an order, Captain!

241
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,166
"...I'm always coming home late
so I don't have to fuck her."

242
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,210
I'm talking to you, Captain!

243
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,916
Gandía!

244
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,000
Grenade!

245
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,000
Take cover!

246
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,875
What was that?

247
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,166
- Rio.
- Rio! Where are you going?

248
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,250
Get back here!

249
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,541
Bogotá, we need you here right now!

250
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,083
Two minutes, Lisbon.
Get out of the fucking way!

251
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,750
Against the wall! Let's go, come on! Move!

252
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,208
Hang in there.

253
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,500
It's okay. It's okay.

254
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,041
Here.

255
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,583
Stockholm, did you stitch him up?
Do you copy?

256
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,416
<i>I'm trying!</i>

257
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,416
I'm trying, okay? Fuck.

258
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,875
- Ramiro, are you okay?
- Yes, sir.

259
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,708
Hernando?

260
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,958
Canalejas?

261
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,916
Torrecilla and Tosco,
injured, Major.

262
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,875
You killed him.

263
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,875
You killed him!

264
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,250
<i> One casualty, Professor.</i>

265
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,333
It was an accident.

266
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,208
These things can happen.

267
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,250
- Not here.
- Arteche.

268
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,517
- What's going on?
<i>- They're fighting each other.</i>

269
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,166
That buys us a few minutes,
not much more than that.

270
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,250
Arteche, you need to calm down.

271
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,453
Cañizo here. We have a shooting angle
on the top of one of the kitchen windows.

272
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
<i>There's not much visibility,
but it lines up with one of the pantries.</i>

273
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,500
- Maintain your position.
- Copy that.

274
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,791
Arteche.

275
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,875
I got him, right?

276
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,375
- Did I get him or not?
- You shot him on the vest.

277
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,875
Nice work.

278
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,083
Arteche! Two members
of your team are wounded.

279
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,333
Go look after them.

280
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,500
Arteche! That is an order.

281
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
You're doing so fucking great.

282
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,416
Are we gonna see
another love story here?

283
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:19,166
- Just shut your mouth, okay? Shut it.
- What about earlier... The rooftop stuff?

284
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,750
I mean, I understand when you're scared,
you say stuff you don't mean.

285
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,833
It's all good.

286
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,625
You don't understand. I meant it.

287
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,333
Well, I don't think it's the best time to,
uh, talk about these things.

288
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,541
You know what, though?
I decided to be honest a long time ago.

289
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,916
What's going on with you?

290
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,208
Nothing. It's just how I feel.
I wanna set the record straight, Dani.

291
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,916
"Set the record straight"?
We're in a fucking war.

292
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,583
I'm with Stockholm,
so the record couldn't be straighter.

293
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,500
Are you really in love with her?

294
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,166
I'll cover you.

295
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,083
You disobey me again and I'll put you
on your knees and shoot you in the head.

296
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,642
- You're not answering me.
- I'm in love. Head over heels.

297
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,250
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?

298
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:36,083
I know you. I mean, I know who you are.
I know what you like. I know your dreams.

299
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,833
That huge nightclub you wanted to set up,
three stories, awesome stuff.

300
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,750
You've got enough money now, right?

301
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,500
It's just that Indonesia doesn't have
the typical Spanish discos, you know?

302
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,333
But dancing? Yeah.
I danced a lot with Stockholm.

303
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,208
Even, uh, in the vault too.

304
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,208
Okay, what about your martial arts studio?

305
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,541
They definitely have those in Indonesia.
You can't say they don't, you know...

306
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,166
Yeah, but I can't keep
hitting people my whole life.

307
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,041
I wanted to grow up.

308
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,208
Tell me one thing.

309
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,083
You spent two fucking years in Indonesia.

310
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,000
In all that time,
didn't you have any doubts?

311
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,083
Never.

312
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,833
When I get up in the morning and...

313
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,833
I look beside me and see Stockholm,
the sun coming through our window...

314
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,666
My... My life is like a fucking commercial.

315
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,083
A commercial for cologne.

316
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,625
That's not you.

317
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,916
That's not your life.

318
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,291
It's a different life,
but it's still his life too.

319
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,166
We all have multitudes.

320
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,625
- I really don't think this is necessary.
- Quiet.

321
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,000
Keep walking.

322
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,750
Anyone here?

323
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,750
No.

324
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,833
Is this your grandma's place?

325
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,958
Well, it's... It's just a safe house.

326
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,083
Who are they?

327
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:38,500
Well, they're people
in your same situation. They're...

328
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,875
potential members of the gang.
You're the first recruit.

329
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,625
Great.

330
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,083
This way I can stop you
from making a fool of yourself.

331
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,166
People who try to steal 2.4 billion euros

332
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,333
usually end up getting shot in the face.

333
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,458
So stop saying that you can.

334
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,791
You get shot when you don't think.

335
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,083
When you go into a bank barefaced
and you do...

336
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,375
the first thing that comes to mind.

337
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,041
But this heist
has been in the making for a long time.

338
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,333
Yeah, how long then?

339
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,958
Twenty years.

340
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,208
I'm offering you your freedom.

341
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,791
I'm already free.

342
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,041
I can leave through that door
right now and disappear.

343
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,416
So go then.

344
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,500
You're not going to leave,

345
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,983
because you have nothing
or no one waiting for you out there.

346
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,750
You don't do it, because your life ended
in your last robbery.

347
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,541
I'm offering you resurrection.

348
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,625
A second life.

349
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,916
Although, if you want,

350
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,791
you can continue to obsess
over the memories of the first one.

351
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,791
What do you think you know about my life?

352
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,791
Or about what I've done to get freedom?

353
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,541
I'll learn the only thing
I need to know about you right now:

354
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,375
Whether you're brave enough

355
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,875
to be born again.

356
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,750
To live again. To find another love.
A family. It's a "yes" or a "no,"

357
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,041
and today's the day.

358
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,083
So,

359
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:23,000
don't you think
he would want you to be happy again?

360
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,750
Who are you?

361
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:40,916
Welcome to the game.

362
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,166
Go, go, go!

363
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,583
Hurry up!
They're gonna die in there.

364
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,833
Smelters in the museum.
We'll start cutting.

365
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:53,916
Good.

366
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,375
Let's go. Come on!

367
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,208
Give me the jackhammer.

368
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,541
Mónica, where's the jackhammer?

369
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,166
Stockholm! The jackhammer, where is it?

370
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,166
There.

371
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,583
Morphine.

372
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,458
Give me morphine. I need it.

373
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,750
I recognize that look.

374
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,583
The first kill.

375
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,916
Keeps haunting your fucking head.

376
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:53,958
It'll pass. It's a shock.

377
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,583
Morphine.

378
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,083
Please.

379
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:20,583
Get ready, Tokyo, freshen up.
I'm coming for you.

380
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:24,083
<i>A lot of people believe
we only find one true love in our lives.</i>

381
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:29,708
<i>But what they don't realize...
is you can have several lives.</i>

382
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,791
Psst.

383
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:54,541
Rio, no?

384
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,625
Yeah.

385
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,416
What's up?

386
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,750
Just looking at the stars.

387
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,958
What is it?

388
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,458
I didn't expect that.

389
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,875
Because you don't know me.

390
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,791
Look, that's the Dipper.

391
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,208
And that one there is Ursa Major,

392
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,916
and that one's Polaris.

393
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,708
Hacker and astronomer. Look at you.

394
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,291
The Professor gathered
an eclectic group.

395
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,041
Is it true that you can read
the future in the stars?

396
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,416
You know how?

397
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,416
Well, I do, uh... I do have some notion.

398
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,375
Then, read my future.

399
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:47,916
Really?

400
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:49,583
Okay.

401
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,333
Okay, so, looking at the star arrangement...

402
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:00,416
Mm-hmm.

403
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,416
...it looks like
you're gonna meet a guy.

404
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Is he cute?

405
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,958
For that, we'll have to check
the angle of Andromeda.

406
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,583
Look. There it is.

407
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,083
- What?
- Andromeda.

408
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,166
Show me.

409
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:20,041
Look. There.

410
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,291
Oh, yeah.

411
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,625
What?

412
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,541
Well, the guy is pretty normal.

413
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,625
He's a bit of a loner too.

414
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:35,958
An average guy.

415
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,208
But a good guy.

416
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,125
Well, I don't know how I'll meet this guy.

417
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:46,408
Since I'm stuck here,
taking classes with the Professor.

418
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,291
That's a question for Cassiopeia.

419
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,583
Let's ask her.

420
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,583
- Wow, that's weird.
- What?

421
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,916
Cassiopeia says you'll meet him dancing.

422
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:14,208
<i>♪ I had to leave you and go away

00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,500

441
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,583
It's fine.
Professor, we lost one of the lances.

442
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,333
How much time do we need, Bogotá?

443
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:40,916
<i> About six minutes.</i>

444
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,875
Professor, what was that?

445
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,916
I have something to announce.

446
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,833
We have, um, one more little human
at the stormwater tank.

447
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,833
Inspector Alicia Sierra
has given birth to a baby.

448
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,583
It's a... It's a beautiful girl.

449
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,500
She weighs three
and a half kilos approximately.

450
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,500
She's in excellent health.

451
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,625
Congratulations.

452
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:17,333
<i>A baby always brings joy.</i>

453
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,583
And there hasn't been much joy
around here lately.

454
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,208
<i>What's her name?</i>

455
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,666
I was thinking Germán, like her father.

456
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,958
<i>But since it's a girl, I just don't know.</i>

457
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,250
And Danica?

458
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,333
In my country it means,
well, "morning star."

459
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,208
You're quite the poet, Marseille.

460
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:55,583
I don't know if you're open to suggestions
but, um... I always liked Lucía.

461
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,541
I don't know if she looks like a Lucía.

462
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,791
She looks more like a Victoria.

463
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,250
Victoria.

464
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,791
I'm gonna name her Victoria.
I'm gonna name her Victoria.

465
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,666
- Victoria is a great name.
<i>- I'm gonna name her Victoria.</i>

466
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,166
Because this girl is gonna be victorious.

467
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,583
She will.

468
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,291
And I'll be there by her side.

469
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,166
Hold her.

470
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,208
Come here.

471
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,375
Victoria.

472
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,791
Everything you bought is pink.

473
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,000
Yes. Pink because she's a girl.

474
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,000
So what she's a girl?

475
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,958
First of all, there's no such thing
as colors for girls or boys.

476
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,791
Second,
you're conditioning her.

477
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,208
How do you know
whether she's gonna feel like a girl,

478
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,083
a boy, or whatever she feels like?

479
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:51,916
She's not even a day old
and you're already traumatizing her.

480
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,875
Even the rattle you bought is pink.
Give me the baby.

481
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:58,500
No. She gave <i>me</i> the baby.
You've lost your head.

482
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,916
Cover the door.

483
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,333
Lost the lance.

484
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,166
Professor, only two lances left.

485
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,625
Come on, you two. Hurry.

486
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,791
Cañizo, they're inside the pantry.

487
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:45,875
Tokyo, run!

488
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,041
Fire!

489
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,166
Tokyo!

490
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,708
Tokyo!

491
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:31,750
Tokyo, Tokyo, no! Hey, hey.

492
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,916
<i>The day I killed Gandía,
all the odds were against me.</i>

493
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,791
<i>Like a marionette
held together with bullets.</i>

494
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,625
<i>And those five bullet wounds,</i>

495
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,250
<i>reminded me of my samurai.</i>

496
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,875
Open it. Don't worry, it's not a ring.

497
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,833
It's a Japanese samurai.

498
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,833
I found it in a shop window.

499
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:17,958
It's a sign.

500
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,541
You think I don't know
what's on your mind?

501
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:25,791
What? You can read minds now
with a snow globe?

502
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,375
You don't wanna live the high life
and leave your mother behind.

503
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,708
But I thought about that too.

504
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,125
We're gonna give her a gift.

505
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,291
A pool boy to sweeten her life up?

506
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,458
We're gonna pay her mortgage.

507
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,333
If you and I decide to go to Polynesia,
then she can go to Rome.

508
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,000
Or Paris or wherever she wants.

509
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,583
She can have a good life.

510
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,458
She deserves it, right?

511
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,875
You deserve it too.

512
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,000
And where will we get all of that money?

513
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,833
Oh, ask this thing. Rub it a little.
Let's see what it says.

514
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,250
Let's see.

515
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,250
It says that...

516
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,541
It says that you've thought about it.

517
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,458
Right?

518
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,250
Banks.

519
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,833
We already pulled off 15 clean heists.

520
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,166
We're really focused.

521
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,875
- We're good.
- We're the fucking best.

522
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,916
Let's go after some banks.

523
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,750
You know it's more risk, right?

524
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:09,125
Stay with me, stay with me.

525
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,500
Professor Tokyo's... Tokyo's really hurt.

526
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,333
<i>She got shot five times
in her arms and her legs.</i>

527
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,458
Fuck! We lost another lance.

528
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:25,583
Enough. Muchachos, back to the foundry.

529
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,500
Hold on.

530
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,875
Professor, we just ran out of gas.

531
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,291
<i> Help me, Lisbon.</i>

532
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,750
Denver, listen to me.

533
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,416
<i>It'll take a little longer
to open the museum.</i>

534
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,333
Set up a defensive position
and cover any possible entry.

535
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,056
If you stay entrenched, we have a chance.

536
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:06,250
We're gonna make it.
We are going to make it.

537
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,291
Let's go.

538
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,875
You motherfuckers!

539
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,708
You're not going in.
You stay outside. Come on. Come on.

540
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,333
Go place the charges.

541
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,083
Anyone crosses that door,
you gun them down.

542
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,166
Everyone else, take cover.

543
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,041
Can you shoot?

544
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,666
I can shoot
until my fucking arms fall off.

545
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:15,416
Manila, Manila.
Let's go, come on. Let's go!

546
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,541
Professor,
we're behind the trench.

547
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,625
There's no fucking way out of here.

548
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:34,916
There's no way out.
There's no way out. There's no way out.

549
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,750
Denver?

550
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,666
<i>Denver, the hole.</i>

551
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,333
Denver, there's a hole.

552
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:42,916
The dumbwaiter.

553
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,833
<i>The dumbwaiter from the office, Denver.</i>

554
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:51,458
<i> The dumbwaiter. Denver,
the dumbwaiter from the office, Denver.</i>

555
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,875
Hurry up, son of a bitch.

556
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:16,708
What?

557
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,083
It's six floors down.

558
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,083
The fuck!

559
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,291
Come on. Go down.

560
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:40,125
- What?
- You gotta go.

561
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,791
<i>- Both of you.</i>
<i>- No</i>.

562
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,125
<i> You gotta go now.</i>

563
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,791
- And you?
- I'm staying.

564
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,083
- What?
- I can't go down.

565
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,500
- No, no, no.
- Manila, listen to me. Manila!

566
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,666
I can't hold on to the ropes, okay?

567
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,958
I need you to get down there.
Get down there as fast as you can.

568
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:58,000
Then you lay down cushions, curtains,
cardboard boxes, anything you can find.

569
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,750
You understand? Okay? I'll jump.

570
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,125
- Come on, Manila.
- No.

571
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,458
Just go! Now!

572
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,500
Manila, let's go!
Come on! Let's go! Right now.

573
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,333
This isn't happening.
You're coming with me.

574
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,291
I'm not leaving you here. Come on.

575
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:16,375
- Let me go!
- Let's go.

576
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:19,000
- Denver, let me go. You're hurting me.
- Tokyo.

577
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,208
Hey, hey.

578
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,875
- Listen to me, listen to me, please.
- Listen to me.

579
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,375
I already lost my dad in a heist.

580
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,125
I'm not gonna lose my sister too.

581
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,333
I'm not gonna lose you.

582
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,750
Darling,

583
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,250
I need you to go save my life.

584
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,333
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Okay.

585
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:43,416
It's okay.

586
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,500
Go, go. I'll be okay.

587
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,708
- Charges in place.
- Connect the fuses.

588
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,333
Tokyo!

589
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,666
Fuses are ready.

590
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Tokyo.

591
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:45,208
Tokyo. I'm here with you.

592
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:46,625
I'm here with you.

593
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:47,708
Ramiro?

594
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,375
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you out, all right?

595
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,166
- You're a handyman too?
- I'm full of surprises.

596
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,375
Take cover!

597
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,541
Tokyo, what is it?

598
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:02,708
What's going on?

599
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,166
Rio, they're here.

600
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,250
Move in!

601
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,500
Manila, go. Hurry up!

602
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,041
- I'm opening the gap.
- Rio, Rio.

603
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,583
There's no time.

604
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:26,458
There's no time.

605
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,250
No, don't say that.
And don't smile like that.

606
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,791
I'm just really glad that you're here.

607
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,458
No.

608
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,000
Tokyo.

609
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,125
Do you know what I'm remembering?

610
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:05,291
Our first night in Toledo.

611
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,666
When we danced together.

612
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,416
Now!

613
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,541
Professor, we made it down.

614
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,573
Tokyo, they made it downstairs.

615
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,000
Hold on a little longer, 30 seconds.

616
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,500
Mónica, hey!

617
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:45,500
Mónica!

618
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:48,125
- Fuck!
- Come on! Hurry up!

619
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:50,958
Fire!

620
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:54,583
Tokyo.

621
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,375
Rio.

622
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,666
Don't be so sad.

623
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,208
- Something ends today.
- No, no, no.

624
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,750
But now is
the first day of your next life.

625
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,458
You've gotta live
a lot of lives, my love.

626
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,083
- No.
- So many.

627
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:26,833
Move in!

628
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,416
Now, get going...

629
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:34,041
because it's party time.

630
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,333
No, no, no!

631
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:42,416
Tokyo!

632
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Fire, Arteche!

633
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,500
No!

634
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,041
Canalejas!

635
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,541
Motherfucker!

636
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:01,458
Fire!

637
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,333
<i>Tokyo, jump!</i>

638
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:11,875
Tokyo!

639
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:13,458
Tokyo!

640
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,517
- <i> Tokyo, do you hear me?</i>
- There's no time.

641
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,041
Jump now.

642
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,208
Tokyo!

643
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:27,125
Tokyo, jump now. There's no time.

644
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,458
It's gonna be tough, Professor.
Can you go on without me?

645
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,541
No, Tokyo. I can't. Jump right now!

646
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,208
You've always been my guardian angel.

647
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:37,875
Now's my turn to be yours.

648
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:49,000
No, no!

649
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:24,250
<i>Growing old in a prison cell
isn't for me.</i>

650
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,583
<i>I'd rather be on the run.</i>

651
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,291
<i>And if I can't run with my body,</i>

652
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,500
<i>at least let my soul be free.</i>

653
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,041
Get back!

654
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,291
Tokyo!
