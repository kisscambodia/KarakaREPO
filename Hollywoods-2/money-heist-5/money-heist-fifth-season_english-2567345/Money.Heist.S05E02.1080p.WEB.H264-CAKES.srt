I want your whole team ready.

48
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,833
I want a clean operation!

49
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,833
Priority is those three bitches.
Then worry about the hostages.

50
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,875
I want them here!
I don't care how you do it!

51
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,958
You heard him.
Everyone get ready to go in. Make sure...

52
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,000
- We can't do that, Tamayo.
- She pissed in our faces, Ángel.

53
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,583
I have to take them out,
no matter what the cost.

54
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,541
30 seconds, Suárez!

55
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,166
They're waving a white flag. It's been
a symbol of peace since the Punic Wars.

56
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,416
Even the Nazis respected it.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,916
Are we gonna pretend we didn't see it
in front of the whole world?

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,250
Sir, prepped and ready.

59
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,166
- Colonel, your orders.
- I heard you! I'm trying to think here.

60
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,291
- If we go to talk, we look like shitheads.
- No.

61
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,541
What we have to do is show everyone

62
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,125
who the good guys
and bad guys are in this war.

63
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,416
It's an opportunity for them
but for us as well.

64
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,166
We have to project a positive image.

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,000
No tie. No jacket. No bullet-proof vest.
And roll up your sleeves.

66
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,583
But I'll look like a total bitch.

67
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,458
You'll look solid as a rock, Tamayo.
You gotta be tough, all right?

68
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,666
Give them an ultimatum.
We go in in two minutes.

69
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,541
We need to make sure
they're panicking in there.

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,083
They gotta know they're fucked.

71
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,833
You've given me a hard-on, Angelito.

72
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,458
Get me a security detail so I can go out
and negotiate with those three.

73
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,333
- Go get them.
- Good luck.

74
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,416
Governor.

75
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,500
What's the deal with the military?

76
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,458
This is not
a civil conflict anymore.

77
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,666
Two battalions, strike forces...

78
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,666
They're coming in.

79
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,125
It's about time.

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,875
No, this isn't good.

81
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,166
The police see us as hostages.

82
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,500
But to the army, we're collateral damage.

83
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,896
<i>Leaving security perimeter.</i>

84
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,041
What's that supposed to mean exactly?

85
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,166
That means they'll shoot anyone
wearing a mask.

86
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,375
Their priority is to kill them,

87
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,250
not to rescue any of us.

88
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,875
It looks like
The Three Graces have arrived

89
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,791
to give a gentle touch to the heist.

90
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,708
We're out here without masks
so everyone can see

91
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,875
that I'm not at the National Court,

92
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,833
and I'm not being held in a tent
for questioning or in jail.

93
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,291
- Okay, what the fuck do you want?
- Gandía's injured.

94
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,333
I need to show you this.

95
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,666
Raise your hand.
Let's see if they'll follow your orders.

96
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,583
Palermo.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,666
Showtime, my precious reptile.

98
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,625
Come on, come on.

99
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,250
There's a shard lodged
between cervical vertebrae C3, 4, and 5.

100
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,000
One wrong move
and his arm will stop moving forever.

101
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,291
Or maybe his lungs.
It's a thing called the phrenic nerve.

102
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,041
He needs a neurosurgeon
as soon as possible.

103
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,375
Maybe one from the army.
You've got someone here.

104
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:17,333
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Let's make a run for the tent. Right now!

105
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,808
Nobody's gonna shoot us.
We can't risk going back inside the bank.

106
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,125
- Of course we have to go back.
- Huh?

107
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,958
The other hostages have no idea.

108
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,333
Well, they're gonna find out.

109
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,666
It's every man for himself
over here, Mr. Governor.

110
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,750
We have to. We have a moral obligation.

111
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,000
You came in here to be a hero, didn't you?

112
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,541
Well, now's your moment.

113
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,208
If I send a doctor in, I'll have to wait
three or four hours to send the army,

114
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,583
which is something
you know I'm going to do.

115
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,416
That's why you're pulling
the only card you have. Gandía's injury.

116
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
You're gonna let a man
who's been loyal to you be paralyzed?

117
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,625
Mmm. Let him out. I'll take care of him.

118
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,750
I get nothing out of that, Tamayo.

119
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,250
Yes, you do.

120
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,625
Allow me to explain.

121
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,250
If you don't let him out,
I go in immediately.

122
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,000
But if you do let him out,

123
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:13,166
I could wait for an hour while he tells me
the details of your little shit show.

124
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,250
Your decision.

125
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,750
Give me a minute to discuss this
with the rest of my team.

126
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,833
<i>Of course.</i>

127
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,458
Looks like I'm leaving
before you do, Sandokan.

128
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,916
What the fuck are you doing, Bogotá?

129
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,750
<i>At that moment...</i>

130
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,916
We gotta release Gandía.
We really need that hour.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,750
<i>...Lisbon was the only one
who noticed a small detail...</i>

132
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,666
Lisbon?

133
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,875
<i>...something that would radically change
how we played the game.</i>

134
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,625
They don't have the Professor.

135
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,416
- What?
- What?

136
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,583
He came here to give us an ultimatum
but he didn't even use his best move.

137
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,000
If you had the option to checkmate
in one move and you don't do it...

138
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,416
Then it's because you don't know
that you can.

139
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Exactly.

140
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,208
Sierra's working alone.

141
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,333
I'm beginning to like
that fucking nutcase.

142
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,708
Get Gandía ready.

143
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,750
I'm gonna throw a couple punches
at this piece of shit.

144
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
Bogotá, stop!

145
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,666
Even with these shards in my back,
I'm going to kick your ass.

146
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,291
For fuck's sake, Bogotá!

147
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,416
We're releasing him.
He can't be beat to shit.

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
We're not, we're releasing his corpse.

149
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,000
Go on, the minister's gonna be waiting
for me with a medal.

150
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,375
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

151
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,583
Every time you hit him, you're hitting us.

152
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,750
You're gonna screw us
'cause of your pride.

153
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,250
We're already screwed.

154
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,750
This won't change a thing.
All we have left is our dignity.

155
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,791
You wanna get your revenge.

156
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,500
Revenge is an act of selfishness,
you know that.

157
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,916
It's respect.

158
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,708
It's respect for ourselves.
It's respect for the person he executed.

159
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,666
- That's what it is.
- I'm with him!

160
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,500
Are you all fucking crazy or what?

161
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,625
Lisbon told us she's letting him go.
She's out there buying us time.

162
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,083
I don't know Lisbon,
but I did know Nairobi.

163
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,416
They're about to kill us,
but we're getting rid of him before that.

164
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,708
Oh, now you're killing him? Now, huh?

165
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,458
Now you're the piece of shit
yelling in the back "Kill him"?

166
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,458
When you had the chance, you couldn't.
You didn't have the balls.

167
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,416
You didn't have the balls.
You just stood there, trembling.

168
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,833
Cut the fucking bullshit!

169
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,416
You're gonna
beat each other up now too?

170
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Okay, asshole, now you're accusing me?

171
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,083
The only one to blame here is him.
He pulled the trigger.

172
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,250
That bastard over there did it
because he wanted to.

173
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,750
So leave me the fuck alone.

174
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,708
Do you want me
to take some flowers to the morgue?

175
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,791
I'm sure your little friend
is still nice and warm.

176
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,500
And still plenty tight.

177
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,223
What would you do if he killed Stockholm?

178
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,000
You beat the shit out of Arturo
and he just teased you.

179
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,916
That motherfucker over there killed her.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,541
What, so you get a free pass
but no one else does?

181
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,958
Do whatever the fuck you want.

182
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,875
Is it that important to you?

183
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,833
Palermo,

184
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,666
I have to do it
or I can't look you in the eyes.

185
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,875
He's all yours.

186
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,791
Let's enjoy recess
before the girls come back.

187
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,666
- Let's find out.
- Okay.

188
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,916
We will release Gandía.

189
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,458
Before I do, I need to ask the Professor.

190
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,041
You go ahead and ask
whatever you need to ask.

191
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,750
You've got four minutes.

192
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,000
And what do you propose we do?

193
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
We need to organize an escape.

194
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,666
With 10, 15, or 20 hostages.

195
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,166
We have a deal.

196
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,791
We take them somewhere secure.

197
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,958
You know there's no such thing
as somewhere secure in there.

198
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:15,875
Of course there is.

199
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,416
Come on, come on.

200
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:21,583
For example, any of the four vaults
that only open with my fingerprints.

201
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,083
Hit me.

202
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,541
I said hit me.

203
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,750
Come on, hit me!

204
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,250
You know why I'm gonna kill you?

205
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,416
Because I groped
your girlfriend's nice ass?

206
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,666
No.

207
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,583
Because you're a fascist.

208
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,000
As soon as you lift a gun
to defend your country,

209
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,625
every dumbass
is ready to call you a fascist.

210
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,666
<i>Doors!</i>

211
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,708
Because you called her "mutt."

212
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,291
"Gypsy."

213
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,583
Oh shit!

214
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,750
- Close the doors! Make a line!
- Get back! Come on!

215
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,666
- I said get back!
- "Melon seller!"

216
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,750
- Against the wall! Hands up!
- Stop now!

217
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,875
Because you called Palermo
"one-eyed queer."

218
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,083
Right now!

219
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,375
- Stay out of it!
- Stop it!

220
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,875
And "<i>sudaca</i>!"

221
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,958
- What are you doing?
- You're racist!

222
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,625
We're trying to come up with a miracle
and you start a fight?

223
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,791
You're sexist!

224
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,041
- Make them stop!
- No!

225
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,791
You're a homophobe!

226
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
And this one is for Nairobi.

227
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,791
Bogotá, Bogotá, hey.

228
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,583
Bogotá.

229
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,166
He killed Nairobi.

230
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,833
The police don't have the Professor.

231
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,250
Nairobi wouldn't want this.

232
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,750
Tamayo doesn't know
about the Professor. It's not checkmate.

233
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,125
We still have a chance.

234
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,500
- He killed her.
- Let him go.

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,666
Let him go.

236
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,666
I still make you horny, don't I?

237
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,500
Tokyo...

238
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,291
you missed it.

239
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,416
Boom.

240
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,083
Come on, children. Playtime is over!

241
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
- Stitch him up.
- I'll rip you apart, motherfucker!

242
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,708
She was the one that knocked me down,
fucking Sandokan!

243
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,333
Not you! Not you!

244
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,791
On the ground,
you fucking terrorists!

245
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,000
- Let's go, come on! Hurry!
- Get 'em the hell out of here!

246
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,375
- Denver! Are you okay?
- Denver!

247
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,291
That son of a bitch.

248
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,916
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Stay calm.

250
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:31,708
Let me see the wound.

251
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,541
Don't worry.

252
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,750
It's okay.

253
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,916
There's an exit wound,
I need the surgical kit!

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,833
- Get it now!
- Okay.

255
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,541
Go get the kit. Your gun, come on!

256
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,875
Helsinki, Manila, the hostages escaped.

257
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,583
<i>They hit Denver and some of their own.
They're armed!</i>

258
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,083
Copy that.

259
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,833
Come on!

260
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,708
Matías, you stay here,
don't let anyone move.

261
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
Let's go!

262
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,916
Let me see.

263
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,041
Fucker!

264
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,750
Wait, Denver. Denver.

265
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,958
Take care of Gandía, he's our priority!

266
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,291
Denver!

267
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,750
Shit!

268
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,833
I want a medical unit by the entrance now!

269
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,500
The head of security of the Bank of Spain
is coming out and his prognosis is grave.

270
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,416
Let's go!

271
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,416
After that, I want you to go into action.

272
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,250
- You're in charge of the intervention.
- Mm-hmm. With which team?

273
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,000
Special Forces Unit III.
You know most of them. They're the best.

274
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,166
- Cañizo!
- At your order, sir!

275
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,875
- Get your men ready to go fucking dancing.
- Yes, sir.

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,708
- Anything from the recording?
- Sounds like a gunfight.

277
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,750
I told you I'd go in with my team.

278
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,875
That's who I want.

279
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,625
The guys you demanded
are completely out of the question.

280
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,375
Colonel,

281
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,083
this is going to be a massacre.

282
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,291
I need men
who won't ask who's behind the mask

283
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,125
when they have to pull the trigger.

284
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,125
Special Forces will ask questions
because somewhere in their brains

285
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,791
hides the deep-seated notion
of rescuing hostages.

286
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:10,375
I need people who are gonna get in there
to conquer territory, not to save lives.

287
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,916
How many civilian casualties
are we talking about?

288
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,375
Well, if I were you,
I wouldn't count on more than...

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,458
30% survivors.

290
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,291
Either I go in with my team, or I won't.

291
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,375
Your team?

292
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,375
Mateo Canalejas,

293
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,541
arrested for playing Russian roulette

294
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,083
with his service weapon
in a bar in Tbilisi.

295
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,875
Arantxa Arteche organized
illegal monkey fights in Gibraltar.

296
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,041
For fuck's sake.

297
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,125
Salvador Torrecilla
pretended to be kidnapped by Boko Haram

298
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,666
after spending six days copulating
with the chancellor's daughter in Mali.

299
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,958
Want some more? Because your trusted
bomb expert, Ramiro Vázquez,

300
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,708
is in a mental hospital in Mondragón.

301
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:56,166
I'm informed about every detail.
They're outside if you wanna meet them.

302
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,583
I reached out to them
when the Professor started dropping money.

303
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,375
Should I go get them,

304
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,416
Colonel?

305
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:10,916
Sagasta!

306
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,041
Stop trying to piss me off.

307
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,000
Go to the right!

308
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,666
Palermo! Let's see those balls you've got!

309
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,791
Fuck!

310
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Son of a bitch!

311
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,208
- Shoot their vests, go!
- Move fast!

312
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,436
- Get down.
- Helsinki, they're coming.

313
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,791
On the ground now!

314
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,333
Do you copy, fatty?

315
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,791
Cover me!

316
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,000
Lisbon!

317
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,291
We're trapped!
There's nowhere we can escape.

318
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,708
I can't die!

319
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,083
We're not gonna be able
to make it to the vaults,

320
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,166
but we can get them out
through the loading dock.

321
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,500
- Okay, how?
- It's just through the next door.

322
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,041
Covering fire! Let's go!

323
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,375
- Motherfucker!
- Damn it!

324
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,956
- They're heading to the loading docks.
- Tokyo, Denver, Manila, follow them!

325
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,125
Palermo, with me.
We'll go through the other door.

326
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,541
Helsinki, go to the top floor.

327
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,416
Report any kind of troop movement,
weapons, ammo, men, all of it.

328
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,708
- I wanna know when they're coming.
- Let's go.

329
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,208
Come on.

330
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,583
Matías, take five of the hostages!
Let's go!

331
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,041
Let's go!

332
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,000
Library, now!

333
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,375
Let's go!

334
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,541
Inspector.

335
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,250
We were correct.
It's confirmed, it was a shooting.

336
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Here.

337
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,708
Fuck!

338
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,541
Get down, get down.

339
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,708
Okay, let's go.

340
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,833
Get back!

341
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,250
- Shoot the vests.
- Okay.

342
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,208
Get inside!

343
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,333
Come on!

344
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,125
Damn it.

345
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,541
We're so fucked.

346
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,125
Come on guys, with me.

347
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,500
- They blocked off the exit with steel...
- Shit.

348
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,750
...and with explosives.

349
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,916
No, they're the ones
that are fucked here, Mr. Governor.

350
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,500
It looks like we've got all their arsenal.

351
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,791
<i>My name is Alicia Sierra.</i>

352
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>I'm an inspector for the National Police.
And there's a warrant out for my arrest.</i>

353
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,041
<i>I'm forced to record this video
in case the police or the CNI</i>

354
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,541
<i>try to hide, distort, or misrepresent
the reality of the situation.</i>

355
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,666
<i>That's not gonna bring me down,
because today is a day of celebration.</i>

356
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,541
<i>We are here. Let's see who's here with me.</i>

357
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,583
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

358
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>Right now, we're in the hiding hole
of this smart little animal,</i>

359
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:41,916
<i>the Professor.</i>

360
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,458
Señor Marquina, say "hi" to the camera.

361
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,958
Señor Marquina?

362
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,541
- I don't think it's necessary.
- It is.

363
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,791
Okay, tell us, señor <i>Professor</i>,
who arrested you?

364
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,458
- You did.
- You, who?

365
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,000
I need you to do your part here.

366
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,250
I've been arrested
by Inspector Alicia Sierra.

367
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,166
Exactly right.

368
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,166
<i>I swear on the baby Jesus.</i>

369
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,250
Me, Alicia Sierra,
at 9:50 a.m., April 8th,

370
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,333
located the Professor's
abandoned stormwater tank.

371
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,666
At kilometer 21,
I simply got off the highway...

372
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,916
Can I tell you the truth?

373
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,541
I'd like to tell you the truth.

374
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,708
Absolutely.

375
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,833
As a part of our Plan Paris,
I recruited someone from the police.

376
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,875
And the person we recruited
was Mr. Benito Antoñanzas.

377
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,708
Officer Antoñanzas jumped
into his building's swimming pool

378
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,666
out of one of the windows
of his apartment,

379
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,125
specifically, the bathroom window.

380
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,125
Um... and that
is when he began to work with us.

381
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,500
In his defense,

382
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,375
we made him fear for his life
and that of his family.

383
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:02,250
Shut up for fuck's sake. Really?
What did you have for lunch, a parrot?

384
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,750
Why are you running your mouth?

385
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,791
I'm trying to
get the facts straight and tell the truth.

386
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,541
The truth? What truth?

387
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,333
You weren't even honest with your brother,
you piece of shit.

388
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,208
- What are you doing?
- That's why now's the right moment...

389
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,708
Oh, you bastard.
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

390
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,500
Marseille!

391
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,000
Listen, I'll blow your fucking head off.
Shut your mouth.

392
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,291
Hey, Marseille!
I'm in here, it's a code red!

393
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,916
Marseille and Benjamín!

394
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,416
Marseille, here!

395
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,583
Ah, fuck.

396
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,250
Here we go.

397
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,958
Marseille, it's the police!

398
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,708
Marseille, the police are here!

399
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm not the fucking police, four-eyes.

400
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,750
Marseille...

401
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,166
Marseille...

402
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,541
Mars... Mar...

403
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,958
- You need a tourniquet.
- I'm fine.

404
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:48,000
Amanda, Miguel, rifles. Get the rifles!

405
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,083
Come on, you can do it.

406
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,125
You two, let's go!

407
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,708
The windows.

408
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,041
You two, you two.

409
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,708
Cover the windows.

410
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,583
- Do you even know what you're doing?
- Perfectly well. What has to be done.

411
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,416
I don't think so.

412
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:32,375
The window!

413
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,666
Get back! Cover!

414
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,583
Stop this now.
You got two people injured here.

415
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,625
Yeah, but I saved another four,
and now we have their arsenal.

416
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,708
Look at me!

417
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,916
They're both fathers.
They both have families.

418
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:03,083
It wasn't my fault.
It was that Goddamn recoil.

419
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,958
It's just collateral damage.

420
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:09,000
We're in the middle of a Goddamn war!
Churchill would see it as a victory.

421
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,291
Ammunition?

422
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,250
- Only two clips.
- What?

423
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,041
We can't cover this entire corridor
with two fucking clips.

424
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:23,083
For fuck's sake.
We gotta blow one of the charges.

425
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:27,125
If you blow the arsenal from the inside,
the entire building will collapse.

426
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,583
Not a great idea.

427
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,833
We need some grenades.

428
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,666
Where the fuck do we get grenades?

429
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:37,083
I know where to find grenades.
And a lot more.

430
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:40,666
Palermo, distract them.
Don't let them suspect we're gone. Lisbon...

431
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:44,750
Good luck!

432
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,500
There's been a shooting
inside the building.

433
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,875
Something critical is going on.

434
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,208
I'll tell you what's going on.

435
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:02,791
The Plan Valencia or Beijing.
They're putting on a show.

436
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,375
They're throwing firecrackers
so we change our strategy.

437
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,666
It's battle rifles. Windows have been hit.
There are civilians in there.

438
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,000
- Suárez, please.
- Colonel.

439
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,041
Are you setting up
an intervention behind my back?

440
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,750
- What if I was? Would that be a problem?
- This is a civil conflict.

441
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,583
I demand to be part of any intervention.

442
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:21,500
You demand?
Who the fuck do you think you are?

443
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:25,125
Sir, I'm the inspector in charge
of this country's special operations.

444
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,333
And though you try to diminish us,

445
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,076
let me remind you
we're the team that took down Berlin.

446
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,833
We got him when he had a Browning.

447
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,333
Sagasta!

448
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,791
Sagasta, go in with your men. Right now!

449
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,041
It's okay.

450
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,500
Rio! Come with me.

451
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:06,125
- God damn it!
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

452
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:08,750
You are really
a colossal son of a bitch, Denver.

453
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:09,833
Huh?

454
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,625
The other heist, the good one...
I can't believe you kicked me out of that.

455
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:18,166
Suddenly, you felt like inviting me
to this one, this fucking disaster!

456
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,916
I'm doing this because I'm a good person.

457
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,416
We both know
I should be kicking you in the balls!

458
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,708
Get the fuck away from me!

459
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,250
Denver!

460
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,583
When you left you were bleeding
like a pig. You gotta come back.

461
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:47,250
Okay. Your arm's gonna go a little numb,
but it's nothing, okay?

462
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,958
Come on, go.

463
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,500
- What are you doing with that?
- I'm gonna make them dance.

464
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,583
Didn't you say we needed to be heroes?
That's exactly what I'm gonna do here now.

465
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,708
We have the hostages in the armory<i>,</i>

466
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,250
<i>and we've got two fucking clips left.</i>

467
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,166
I'm not going anywhere.

468
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,333
There's no point in attacking them now.
We have all their weapons.

469
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,916
It's a matter of time
before the army gets here.

470
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,875
Sweetie. Dani, sweetie,
you need to come back here.

471
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,375
I'm fine, okay? I'm honestly fine.

472
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,541
You're not fine.

473
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,416
Our task now is to defend this position
using our intelligence.

474
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,000
Defend? Like the Italians? Huh?

475
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,958
Even though we have
little Messi on our team?

476
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,083
And Neymar?

477
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,333
And Cristiano Ronaldo?

478
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,250
No, Governor.
We're not defending here. God no.

479
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,666
We're playing tiki-taka!

480
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,791
Come on, kids. Take cover.

481
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,250
Your turn.

482
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,666
- Grenade!
- It's a grenade!

483
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:31,958
Are you okay?

484
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,875
How do you feel?

485
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,375
Bad!

486
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,375
Arturo!

487
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,833
I'm going to rip your fucking balls off!

488
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,958
They're right here, come and get 'em!

489
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,375
Why don't you come and see me sometime?

490
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Oh shit.

491
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,500
- Are you okay?
- No!

492
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,916
They've got enough ammo for five wars!

493
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,333
We're fucked!

494
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:32,875
What is this?

495
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,708
What are you doing? That's a flamethrower.

496
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,750
A flamethrower, huh?

497
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,666
Everything in this room
is flammable and explosive!

498
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,041
Don't worry, Mr. Governor.

499
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,625
The barbecue's gonna be outside.

500
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,625
...is for all of you
who see this mask

501
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,666
as a symbol of resistance.

502
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,708
We need you.

503
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,333
The State has declared war on us.

504
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,666
A filthy war.

505
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,208
Professor?

506
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,500
We've decided
to stand up to them.

507
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,208
<i>The police have arrested
one of us in a foreign country.</i>

508
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:30,833
<i>Aníbal Cortés.</i>

509
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,208
<i>It's been more than two months
since his arrest.</i>

510
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,875
<i>And no formal charges have been made.</i>

511
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,208
Professor?

512
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,958
<i>They haven't requested extradition.</i>

513
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,166
Marseille. The toilet.

514
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,125
- <i>They haven't provided a lawyer.</i>
- Go and look.

515
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,875
<i>He's being held captive...</i>

516
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,833
Hello? Anyone in there?

517
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,333
<i>...in some unknown place.</i>

518
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,708
<i>And in all likelihood,</i>

519
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,458
<i>they are torturing him.</i>

520
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,750
<i>So we are demanding</i>

521
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,916
<i>that his illegal detention
be brought to an end right now.</i>

522
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,791
<i>And that he's brought to justice
while respecting legal standards.</i>

523
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:18,208
- <i>The State began this war...</i>
- Benjamín.

524
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,000
<i>...and we're not going to hide.</i>

525
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,166
He's sleeping.

526
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,458
<i>We're going to fight...</i>

527
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,333
<i>...blow</i>

528
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,750
<i>by blow.</i>

529
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:31,666
<i>And this time...</i>

530
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:37,083
<i>...the heist will be even bigger.</i>

531
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,875
You did
a good job, Professor.

532
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,583
Next I'm gonna unload
the entire clip through the door.

533
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,208
I suggest you slide your gun to me
and come out.

534
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,000
Very well.

535
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,000
Three, two,

536
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,041
one.

537
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:06,333
Who the fuck are you?

538
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,875
- Logroño?
- No...

539
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,875
No city name. No...

540
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,583
I don't have one.

541
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,041
Shit! The cylinder's out of oxygen. On it.

542
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,791
Okay, so...

543
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:34,208
It's filling up. It'll take a minute.

544
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,458
You know that I let you break up with me.

545
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,681
You didn't get to hear what I had to say.

546
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,931
You're not leaving this place without me.

547
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,250
You know that, right?

548
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,125
You might have to kidnap me.

549
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,083
That's not a cool way
to restart a relationship.

550
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,416
It'd be kinda fun though.

551
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,166
I just learned
new tricks about kidnapping.

552
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,625
You know, tying people up.

553
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,125
Are you gonna cut the steel
or flirt with me?

554
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,000
I can do two things at the same time.

555
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,708
Hell, maybe even three.

556
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,541
You three, in the front jeep, come on!
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

557
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,125
This is Helsinki.

558
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,625
<i>There's some movement outside.</i>

559
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,541
Looks like Special Forces.

560
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,750
<i>They're going in heavy, lots of guns.</i>

561
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:58,791
<i>A C90 rocket launcher,
grenade launchers, machine guns,</i>

562
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,541
shotguns, rifles.

563
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,500
Come on, let's go!

564
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,958
They're getting in two jeeps.
Shit, they're going in right now.

565
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:12,791
Bogotá, this is Lisbon.
Release Gandía immediately.

566
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,500
If we get him out now, he'll tell them
we're chasing the hostages.

567
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,500
If we don't, they'll just waltz in here!

568
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:22,250
We don't have any weapons.
The hostages took them all.

569
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,208
Hey! Cover me! All of you!

570
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:37,500
Shit!

571
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,583
God!

572
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,375
Fuck!

573
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,041
Denver!

574
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,583
I'm the father of Cincinnati!

575
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,166
Motherfucker.

576
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,708
I got a little present for ya!

577
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:01,291
- Who's the father? I don't get it.
- Shut it or I'll staple your mouth.

578
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,375
Come here!

579
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,642
<i>- Area secured.
- All clear.</i>

580
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:15,041
- <i>Prepare to enter.</i>
- We're clear, Colonel.

581
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,875
<i>Green light. We can proceed.</i>

582
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:17,791
Right now!

583
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,375
Ready.

584
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Come on.

585
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,625
Son of a bitch!

586
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:46,833
Arturito!

587
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:51,666
Do you believe in reincarnation?
If you don't, you should be negotiating.

588
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,291
How long can you hold your breath?

589
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:58,708
I can hold my breath as long as it takes
to fuck the cunt of your whore mother.

590
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:01,458
Let's see if that's sufficient.

591
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,416
Fentanyl.

592
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,583
They're opening the doors.

593
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,416
Let's see if this knocks you out, champ.

594
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:30,083
The hostages! The hostages!

595
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,541
- What the fuck is going on?
- The hostages are...

596
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,833
The hostages...

597
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,625
Abort the intervention!

598
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,625
The hostages are...

599
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,541
Confirmed, Colonel.

600
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,500
<i>It's Gandía.
It's Gandía, Colonel. It's Gandía.</i>

601
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,291
Sagasta, abort the operation
until further notice.

602
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:14,333
The hostages...

603
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,750
<i>Denver.</i>

604
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,500
<i>I know you're listening.</i>

605
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,375
Do you think she loves you?

606
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,333
Denver?

607
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:27,666
No.

608
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,875
<i>You're not man enough for that woman.</i>

609
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,083
<i>She would always say</i>

610
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,791
<i>that I taught her what love is.</i>

611
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,083
<i>Did she ever tell you
something like that? No.</i>

612
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,333
<i>You know why?</i>

613
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,041
'Cause you don't have
half the brains I have.

614
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,833
And you can never get where I got.

615
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:48,916
This is revenge, it's personal.
You're just putting all of us at risk!

616
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Shut it!

617
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,291
I know that kid
like I gave birth to him myself.

618
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:56,666
I know where I have to poke him
so that he loses his cool.

619
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,833
That's what I'm gonna do.

620
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,458
And when he comes out,
I'll turn him into ashes.

621
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,750
With me...

622
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,375
With me she never wondered,
"What am I doing with this guy?"

623
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,041
<i>Never.</i>

624
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,583
<i>And I was married, you know?</i>

625
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,666
<i>And she knew that.</i>

626
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,460
But we couldn't stay apart,
not even for a minute.

627
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,583
<i>You could literally see
the sparks fly, man.</i>

628
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,125
<i>Right there, between us,</i>

629
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,750
<i>every time we met by the coffee machine.</i>

630
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,166
I need you to give me your gun.

631
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,083
We were doing it all the time.

632
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,916
In every single corner.

633
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,291
<i>One year...</i>

634
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,291
and another.

635
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,458
<i>I mean, we made love everywhere, Denver.</i>

636
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,041
<i>It didn't matter where it was.</i>

637
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,833
<i>Under the money-printing machine,</i>

638
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,833
<i>or in the cafeteria restroom,</i>

639
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,416
or in my own office.

640
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,416
<i>Or on top of the coin displays.</i>

641
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,083
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

642
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,541
<i>And every night...</i>

643
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:13,208
Every night, as soon as she got home,

644
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,375
<i>she would send me these beautiful texts,</i>

645
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,208
<i>she would send pictures</i>...

646
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:24,250
...and she would say, she would swear to me

647
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,500
that she never felt like that before
and she couldn't live without me.

648
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,125
<i>Denver,</i>

649
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,833
did she ever say
anything like that about you?

650
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,000
<i>Huh? I know she hasn't.</i>

651
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,958
- Give me the walkie.
- Leave it.

652
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,958
<i>Why didn't you have
another child, huh? Your own child!</i>

653
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:45,083
You stole her from me, you son of a bitch!
You had to fucking kidnap her!

654
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:48,708
And when she came to her senses,
she was in the middle of nowhere,

655
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:52,583
condemned to spend her entire life
with a fucking moron!

656
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:54,958
Are you fucking crazy?

657
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,875
Come on!

658
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,291
- Keep your fucking cool, Denver!
- Fuck!

659
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,625
Tokyo is about to come here
with a grenade.

660
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,625
<i>Calm down.</i>

661
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:18,500
Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

662
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
Weapons!

663
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:23,958
They have more weapons.

664
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,125
Fuck!

665
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,875
Change of plans!

666
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,916
You two, get those shields

667
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,833
and put the Browning
on top of that forklift. Come on!

668
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,083
There's no military logic
in choosing to abandon our position.

669
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,791
We have no chance
of beating them if we leave.

670
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,250
Listen carefully
because I'm not gonna say it twice.

671
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,791
They're counterattacking,
you heard them yourself.

672
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:58,791
They have more weapons.

673
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:05,750
As soon as they bring them here,
this will turn into a rattrap.

674
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,166
We'll be totally fucked!

675
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,833
I already told you, let's act now.

676
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,166
Right now!

677
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,500
Let's do it.

678
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:36,250
They're not covering the windows.
We can't wait any longer.

679
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,250
We have to go in right now, let's go!

680
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,083
- What the fuck is this?
- Take cover!

681
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,583
Open!

682
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,541
Close!

683
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,208
Open!

684
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm on my last clip!

685
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,041
Close!

686
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:33,708
Open!

687
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,000
Shit!

688
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:39,208
I'm out of ammo!

689
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,083
Arturo!

690
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,375
Mónica...

691
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,250
Calm down.

692
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,208
Huh?

693
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,666
Don't move or I'll kill him!

694
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,875
On your knees!

695
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,041
Come on, get down.

696
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,851
Don't do
something stupid you're gonna regret.

697
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,625
Put the gun down, please.

698
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,416
'Cause you're not gonna shoot me,

699
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,083
right?

700
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:37,208
You would never shoot
the father of your child.

701
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,708
Do you know how I know?

702
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,541
I'm the only one who will
be able to be there for your child

703
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,291
when this thing is all over.

704
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,000
- The only one who's not gonna shame him.
- Lie down on the floor!

705
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,708
Don't you understand?

706
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,916
Don't you realize it?

707
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,041
Stop trying to be someone you're not.

708
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,666
You'll never be one of them.

709
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,178
You'll always be a secret...
