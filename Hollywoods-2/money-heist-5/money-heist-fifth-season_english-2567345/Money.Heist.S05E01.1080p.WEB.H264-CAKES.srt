00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,750
MADRID
FIVE DAYS SINCE D-DAY

2
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,916
<i>Oh, Alicia...</i>

3
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,541
<i>Now the only way out
is by taking the blame.</i>

4
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,291
<i>And who's gonna do that?</i>

5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,875
<i>For the CNI, Prieto.</i>

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,083
<i>For the police, you.</i>

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,416
<i>Package delivered, Professor.
I'm out in two minutes.</i>

8
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,666
<i>Shit's gonna hit the fan
in every possible scenario.</i>

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,750
<i>Be strong.</i>

10
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,875
<i>We're with you on this.</i>

11
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,458
<i>Lisbon!</i>

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,041
Welcome to the Bank of Spain.

13
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,458
<i>The government gave the orders.</i>

14
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,291
<i>The National Intelligence Agency,
chief of police,</i>

15
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,916
<i>and Ministry of the Interior.</i>

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,583
<i>All of them,
absolutely all of them knew about it.</i>

17
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,416
Where the fuck is the helicopter going?

18
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,458
<i>The official
magistrate of Madrid</i>

19
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>has initiated proceedings
against Alicia Sierra...</i>

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,333
<i>and put out an order for her arrest.</i>

21
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,791
- <i>Yes!
- Come on!</i>

22
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,250
<i>Professor.
Lisbon, we've got Lisbon!</i>

23
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,833
<i>Listen to me. This war,</i>

24
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,416
we're going to win it.

25
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,625
For Nairobi.

26
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,208
For Nairobi.

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,541
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

28
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,041
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

29
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,666
For Nairobi!

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,666
For Nairobi!

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,958
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

32
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,583
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

33
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,083
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

34
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,916
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

35
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,000
Checkmate, you son of a bitch.

36
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,291
If you move an inch, I'll shoot you.
And trust me, I'd love to see you dead.

37
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,625
I'm the wife of a dead man.

38
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,208
I'm a disgraced police officer.

39
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,791
People who used to love me
think I'm a torturer. All thanks to you.

40
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,000
And the only reason
I'm not emptying my clip into your brain

41
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,833
is because someone's gonna need me
for the next 18 years.

42
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,041
But it's a really fine line.

43
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
And if you make me cross it, I'll do it

44
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,000
with a smile on my face.

45
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,041
This is where you've been.

46
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,083
This is your hideout.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,333
In the most vile pit in all of Madrid,
of course.

48
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,125
This place fits who you are. You're a rat.

49
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,958
What are you going to do to me?

50
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,750
You're gonna tell me
the whole plan

51
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,625
so I can deliver you on a platter.

52
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,750
I'm gonna make sure
that you're charged with terrorism,

53
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,250
sentenced to life in prison,

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,833
so you don't ever see sunlight
for the rest of your life.

55
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,208
Because listen to me.

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,083
Your sentence

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,291
will be our salvation.

67
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,541
- Look at the civility.
- Sure.

68
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,416
The beautiful people.

69
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,458
And here we are together, father and son.
So poetic.

70
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,208
Well, it's not like
our relationship has been ideal, Dad.

71
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,625
- Yes, but I forgive you.
- You forgave me, for what?

72
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,916
For being born.

73
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,458
Your mother and I
had an incredible relationship.

74
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,791
Exceptional woman.

75
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,583
And you stood in the way of our happiness.

76
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,833
I wanted to take her to dinners,
go traveling,

77
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,541
make love to her
in the most beautiful places in the world.

78
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,750
And then you showed up and ruined it all.
You were like a nuclear warhead.

79
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,666
You completely destroyed our dreams.

80
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,791
- I don't know. Lots of people have kids.
- Hmm.

81
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,541
- You could've adapted.
- Look at those lobsters!

82
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,666
Oh, we should go eat here. Maître!

83
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,666
Two Danish aquavits
and the menu, please.

84
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,208
Rafael.

85
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,083
Rafael,

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,541
we're here so we can have
a fresh start, hmm?

87
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,541
We're not here
to dwell on the past or our resentments.

88
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,458
You're right, Dad.

89
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,250
The past is the past,
and it doesn't really make sense to...

90
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,541
keep bringing it up, so, that's it.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,416
I'm really glad that we're here,
the two of us together again.

92
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Really.

93
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,375
Oh, Tatiana.

94
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,958
I'm here for a fresh start
with your girlfriend?

95
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,375
A little family honeymoon,
just the three of us.

96
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,041
I guess I'll go to the bathroom.

97
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,416
Something wrong?

98
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,708
He's just a little fussy.
He didn't know you were coming.

99
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,166
Well, did you tell him
he's here for a heist?

100
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,625
My love,
the things that actually matter in life

101
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,500
always come unexpectedly.

102
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,500
And after that, what?

103
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,166
- After the Plan Paris?
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,833
Then we immediately begin Plan Rome.

105
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,333
No.

106
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,958
- Rome? Seriously?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

107
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,041
- That's wonderful!
- What?

108
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,833
Hey, what's happened to you?
You used to be stone cold.

109
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,125
You're not turning into a romantic,
are you?

110
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,375
Of course not.

111
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,375
And what happens after we go to Rome?
Plan Venice?

112
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:29,208
I meant it as a reference of the burning
of Rome during the reign of Nero.

113
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,875
Nero?

114
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,958
That doesn't sound very sexy. Go ahead.

115
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,458
If we release
the only person they were able to capture

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,833
and get them in the bank
right under everyone's noses,

117
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,625
it'll be so humiliating

118
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,291
that they'll try and destroy us
as soon as possible.

119
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,416
They'll resort to using maximum force.

120
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,708
Military.

121
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,083
Let's prepare to intervene immediately.

122
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,416
- I need to talk to you.
- Leave brainstorming for later.

123
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,375
I need backup.

124
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,208
I need intervention officers
from Catalonia and the Basque Country.

125
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
- I want Urruticoetxea!
- Great idea.

126
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,041
Get them and take them
to Puerta del Sol square.

127
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,625
I hear someone's dressed up
and picking pockets!

128
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,041
Only the army can fix this.

129
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,083
Wait a minute, this is a civil matter.
This is an issue for the police.

130
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,625
It's a matter of our national security.
I'm bringing the military in.

131
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,083
They'll come out victorious
or come out dead.

132
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,083
Martínez, get me Major Sagasta.

133
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,541
One battalion, maybe two. I don't know.

134
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,833
And moreover,
they'll go in thirsty for blood

135
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,500
and the killing of hostages
won't matter that much anymore.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,541
And so then what?

137
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,958
- How's it going downstairs?
- Fifty-nine tons are already melted.

138
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,666
Connect the pump, Palermo.
Let's begin extraction.

139
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,458
But there's 31 tons left.
The plan's to melt it all.

140
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,541
I'm here, so the plan's changed.
The priority now is to get it out.

141
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
Our only chance will be
to extract the gold

142
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,875
we've managed to melt
up until that moment.

143
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,208
Oh.

144
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,916
I can't believe
you got me excited about Rome.

145
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,458
- And how long do we have?
- Three or four hours.

146
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,875
They're close to figuring out our plan.
The helicopter's still in the air.

147
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,125
Where is that helicopter?

148
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,458
It's heading southwest from Guadalajara.
We're 11 minutes behind.

149
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,708
I can send an F18 from the base
in Torrejón and shoot it down.

150
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,875
No. That pilot's useless
to us if he's dead.

151
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,708
That helicopter's gonna land.
The moment it does, we'll be there.

152
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,791
Of course.

153
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:23,333
<i>Bear 21.
Bear 21, this is Bravo 03.</i>

154
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,958
<i>Land at once. I repeat, land at once.</i>

155
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,916
Don't even think about touching me!
The wound is next to the femoral artery.

156
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,916
Stitch him up.
Make sure he shuts up.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,875
Okay, hero.

158
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,833
I'll only be worked on
by a surgeon in a hospital!

159
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,291
What the fuck did you do<i>,</i> Manila?
You came in here under one condition:

160
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,750
You wouldn't reveal your identity.
Just a hostage with hostages.

161
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,833
Did you see the guy holding an M16?

162
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,875
Arturo had the M16 and he's useless.
Arturo with a bazooka is useless!

163
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,666
There was a protocol.

164
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,666
You know I kind of saved your life.

165
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,833
Maybe you could at least thank me for it.

166
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,333
If they caught us,
you'd stay with Cincinnati.

167
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
That was the deal.

168
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,750
You were given your orders,

169
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,250
and you blew it.

170
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,375
And now my son has no plan B.

171
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,333
- Manila did what she had to do.
- No.

172
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,625
We trusted her
with the mission of raising our child,

173
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,208
and she wiped her ass with it.

174
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,458
It's never Arturo's fault.

175
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,916
No matter what he does.
I mean, even if he has an M16,

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,458
or rubs himself against you
with a hard-on,

177
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,741
or abuses hostages...
It's always somebody else's fault!

178
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,541
Look,

179
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,333
if we lose Cincinnati,

180
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,410
we're the only ones to blame.

181
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,666
We came in here because we wanted to,
so cut the shit out.

182
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,750
And get back to work.

183
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,250
Attention, gentlemen!

184
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,625
There's a change of plans.
I repeat, a change of plans.

185
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,875
Get all the ingots that are left
and plug in the extractor pump.

186
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,125
Let's go, right now!

187
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,791
Come on!
Move it, move it. Quit sitting around.

188
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,500
Eight more hours at full blast
and we can melt it all.

189
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,416
The melting is secondary.
Now it's about extraction.

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,166
They said we had to melt 90 tons
so we could get out alive

191
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,375
but now 60's enough?

192
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,000
Lisbon's in the bank now.

193
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,291
That will force them
into an intervention we can't handle.

194
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,208
Either we take the gold out now
or we're done, brother. Understand?

195
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,791
Did you have that information before?

196
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
That Lisbon's rescue
would jeopardize our plan?

197
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,041
- Come on, I didn't know fucking shit!
- Of course not, damn it!

198
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,750
Because we never agreed to that.

199
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,208
If getting someone out of jail
puts the plan at risk,

200
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,125
then they stay in jail, period.

201
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,708
And that goes for everyone.

202
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,166
I'm not the one giving orders.

203
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,166
You were before, damn it.

204
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,583
Now what? You run the errands?

205
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,916
Palermo,

206
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,583
looks like we're starting to improvise,

207
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,916
and that's how people
get killed in a heist.

208
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,000
Lisbon to Professor. Do you copy?

209
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,125
<i>Lisbon to Professor.</i>

210
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,208
<i>Do you copy?</i>

211
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,708
<i>Lisbon to Professor. Do you copy?</i>

212
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,833
How long did they keep you
under interrogation in the tent?

213
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,625
Thirty hours.

214
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,041
Why? Is that too long
to keep your mouth shut?

215
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,208
No, for me, no.

216
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,583
For you, I don't know.

217
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,458
Maybe you saw a badge
and you felt nostalgic.

218
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,208
And after that, you told them
how we're getting out the gold.

219
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,583
At least I didn't shake my ass
at every man with a pulse in Panama.

220
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,375
Professor, this is Lisbon.
I need the response.

221
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,500
What is Raquel doing in there?

222
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,083
He's probably working
with Marseille outside.

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,750
In 20 minutes
we should get a check-up call.

224
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,625
But if we have 20 minutes,
I need to take a shower.

225
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,166
And get me a jumpsuit.

226
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,000
I obey your orders, Mrs. Professor.

227
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,041
How did Raquel get into the bank?

228
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,250
How are your buddies coming out?

229
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,000
How are you getting the gold?

230
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,750
Okay, either you talk...

231
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,166
...or I'll shoot you.

232
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not the first time
someone's threatened to shoot me.

233
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,083
Oh, okay. No threats then.

234
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,375
Jesus, the self-control.

235
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,875
We better talk now,

236
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,375
before I decide to shoot you again. Okay?

237
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,875
You're melting the gold.

238
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,375
What for?

239
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,166
We're going to turn the gold into ingots,

240
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,458
into pellets.

241
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,875
Two millimeters
so we can safely get it out.

242
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,625
I knew it.

243
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,666
How's it coming out?

244
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,291
Through the only way possible.

245
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,416
Through the bank sewage system.

246
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,666
It'll come out broken up,
mixed with the water.

247
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,166
You think I'm a total idiot, don't ya?

248
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,291
The sewers in the underground
are filled with police officers.

249
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,208
Tell me the truth.

250
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,708
It'll pass in front of them,
covered in mud, and they won't see it.

251
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,458
So then,

252
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,166
if you're gonna get it out
through the sewers...

253
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,041
why are you here?

254
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,541
What are you doing here?

255
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Come on!

256
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,791
<i>Sagasta, Tamayo speaking,
in charge of the Bank of Spain operation.</i>

257
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,000
- Is something wrong?
<i>- I want you to lead a group in.</i>

258
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,791
Hmm... Negative. I'm on leave.

259
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:54,083
<i>Sagasta, this is a really,
really bad time to be fucking with me.</i>

260
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,458
- You're familiar with me.
<i>- Yes, that's why I called you.</i>

261
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,416
Afghanistan, Yemen,

262
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,666
the pirates in the Horn of Africa,
Boko Haram...

263
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,125
Do you know
what all those missions have in common?

264
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,291
What? The mosquitoes?

265
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>They're undercover operations.
They happen abroad.</i>

266
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,333
There's no witnesses.

267
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,708
Why would I meddle in a civil matter

268
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,250
with Spanish civilians
and the prosecutor's office watching me?

269
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,208
First, because it's an order.

270
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,625
Second, for your country.
Isn't that enough?

271
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,833
They're attacking the national reserve.
You pledged allegiance to the flag!

272
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,500
Listen. Let me tell you
a couple of things, Colonel.

273
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,791
Actually, three things.

274
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,750
Firstly, I couldn't find
the right moment during this conversation

275
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,750
to tell you that I'm taking a shit.

276
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,833
<i>And it doesn't matter now.</i>

277
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
Secondly, I'll be there in 40 minutes.

278
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,250
And the last thing, I'll go in
with my operational team that I trust.

279
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
<i>The ones from Afghanistan,
Yemen, and Mali.</i>

280
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,458
I want them all.

281
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,750
Tell me what this looks like.

282
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,416
This.

283
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,500
Turn me in to the police.

284
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,166
No.

285
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,083
If I take you to the police,
you'll escape.

286
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,750
If I take you to prison, you'll escape.

287
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,125
Wherever I take you, you've got
a fucking plan and you'll escape.

288
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,916
Tell me. Answer my fucking question.
Where are you taking the gold out?

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,750
If you push, you'll never clear your name.

290
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,000
How are you taking it out?

291
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,958
What will you give them?
A smashed corpse, full of bullets?

292
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,708
- Gold.
- They'll think you're completely insane.

293
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
Fair enough, bombs away.

294
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,166
You get it now?
Do you grasp the situation?

295
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,083
You're the one who doesn't get it.

296
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,291
I'll never

297
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,666
turn my gang in. Do you get it now? Never!

298
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,041
Listen to me. The plan is designed
to survive any setbacks,

299
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,500
including my death.

300
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,208
So just do it.

301
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,625
So just let me fall!

302
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,833
Or even better, shoot me!

303
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,333
Empty the entire clip on me!
Come on, I can't wait! Just do it!

304
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,458
Come on!

305
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,708
I'd love to.

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,166
As soon as they know about Murillo,
and they will,

307
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,375
it'll be like a salad bowl full of shit,
the centerpiece on the table,

308
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,125
and someone will have to eat it.

309
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,083
We can share it. Each of us
would get our own nice little portion.

310
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,625
- Or we can make someone else eat it.
- Who, a cop?

311
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,291
No, Pope Francis. You fucking idiot.

312
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,708
Of course it's a colleague.
A former officer.

313
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,666
A traitor, Sierra. She ran away.
Obviously she's working for the Professor.

314
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,666
- How do we know that?
- I don't know.

315
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,250
It's likely there's a mole here.
It's going to be her.

316
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,666
- We can't assume without proof.
- Proof? What proof?

317
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,500
Proof can be fabricated
when it's for a greater cause.

318
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,791
Are we new to this or what?

319
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,166
Martínez, get a hold
of Sierra's emails, okay?

320
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,875
We need to prove
that she leaked Prieto's conversations

321
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,791
with Osman and the stuff about Algeria.

322
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,375
Create a fake location signal
from her phone, near the National Court.

323
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,166
Irrefutable evidence
of her agreement with Murillo.

324
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,458
I'll need the phone carriers to cooperate.

325
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,958
The phone carriers will do
what CNI tells them to.

326
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,916
Antoñanzas, go to forensics
and stop Nairobi's autopsy.

327
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,125
An army doctor should assume the report.

328
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,458
There should only be
a single bullet wound.

329
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,041
By Gandía.

330
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,541
We'll state that
when Sierra ordered to shoot,

331
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,958
Nairobi was wearing a vest.
Come on, let's set up a farce.

332
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,666
With all that,
I think we're gonna be covered.

333
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,708
Colonel, we're breaking the law.

334
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,000
More than they are.
And I believe in the law.

335
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,750
So I'm leaving.

336
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,833
Where do you think you're going, Calimero?

337
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm leaving. If I stay, I'll report anyone
who takes part in this fraud.

338
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,291
Who are you going to report?

339
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,750
The only one who's a fraud here is you!
You found the Professor's hangar.

340
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,833
You could've stopped
his escape but didn't.

341
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,416
Don't try to play Gandhi now!

342
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,166
You better watch what you say to me.
I was waking up from a damn coma!

343
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,291
I have all of your phone recordings.

344
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,583
You seemed a little drunk.

345
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,416
Your phone calls to Murillo.

346
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,958
After 15 years together,
by your side, like a fucking idiot.

347
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,875
She was arrested under your nose
and you didn't have the balls to cooperate

348
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,833
because all you were was her little bitch.
Yes or no?

349
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,250
Answer me, Angelito.

350
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,750
- I'm not answering anything.
- Then get negotiating.

351
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,958
'Cause if you don't, you'll go to prison
before Rio, Tokyo, and Albuquerque.

352
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,250
Okay, you're promoted.
Inspector negotiator. How does that sound?

353
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,083
If you do good,
you can become commissioner.

354
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,083
If I'm gonna be the negotiator,
we'll do it my way.

355
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm not gonna do anything illegal, Tamayo.

356
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,375
"I'm not gonna
do anything illegal."

357
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,875
You just negotiate.
We'll do all the hard stuff ourselves.

358
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,166
Colonel.

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,750
The helicopter is slowing down.

360
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,375
Ground units will be there
in seven minutes.

361
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,916
Hurry them up.
I wanna block all of the roads.

362
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,833
The air deployment continues.

363
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,541
What's up, Maserati?

364
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,625
Your jumpsuit, the towel, and...

365
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,125
a pair of Helsinki's panties.

366
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,375
It's a fucking joke.

367
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,416
Thank you.

368
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Sorry, I was out of line before.

369
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,125
I just needed to see your reaction.

370
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,416
Mm-hmm. And?

371
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,291
And how did I do?

372
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:33,875
You don't seem tense.

373
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,000
I know they're coming for us.

374
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,250
But I can't help thinking
this situation is also romantic.

375
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,333
Oh yeah?

376
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,250
How?

377
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:54,250
He dug a 12-meter tunnel
to get me out of the National Court.

378
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,125
He took me for a ride
all over Madrid in an attack helicopter.

379
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,625
And then, he got me
into the reserve of the Bank of Spain

380
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,666
while 3,000 cops watched.

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,166
That's really nice.

382
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,916
Yeah.

383
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,583
In heists, love can get multiplied.

384
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,833
Is that so?

385
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,333
What do you mean?

386
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:22,916
Well,

387
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,625
'cause every moment
could be your last one.

388
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,958
And all that adrenaline
makes you really feel alive.

389
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,666
You don't wanna leave anything for later.

390
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,791
It does feel a tad more romantic
than going shopping on a Friday.

391
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:45,541
I've known that ever since the first time
I was kissed in the moment before a heist.

392
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,750
<i>Your heart pounds.</i>

393
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,000
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

394
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,083
<i>You walk in...</i>

395
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,375
Nobody move, motherfuckers!

396
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,138
- Come on, wallets out!
- Fucking hands up!

397
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,041
- Come on, goddamn it! Do it!
- Hands up!

398
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,000
Wallets!

399
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,166
- Hands up!
- Come on!

400
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,708
...and you spread chaos.

401
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,625
Fucking goddess!

402
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,125
Open the fucking cash register!
Come on. Now, now, now!

403
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,875
Get out. Get out of here! Now!

404
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,666
And in the middle of the turmoil...

405
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,416
Come on, come on, come on! Move!

406
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,291
<i>...you look at him in the eyes
and realize you're so fucking happy.</i>

407
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:23,625
Wallets out!

408
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:26,708
Come on, come on, come on!
Faster, faster, faster!

409
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,166
Come on, come on, come on!

410
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,416
Yeah!

411
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:36,041
Leaving with a backpack full of cash,
screaming on the motorcycle.

412
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:39,666
<i>Feeling...</i>

413
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,666
...indestructible.

414
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,541
<i>And holding him
while driving at 180 kilometers per hour.</i>

415
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,125
<i>You cross the border
and you're in Portugal.</i>

416
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,416
And you stop anywhere,

417
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:09,166
because you want him so bad
you can't resist it any longer.

418
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,791
You just want to devour time
before it slips away.

419
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,583
And that

420
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,500
<i>makes every moment become so magical.</i>

421
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,791
You're not talking about Rio, are you?

422
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,250
Before him.

423
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,875
He was killed during a heist.

424
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,750
I was there.

425
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,583
After that, I knew
I'd never find a love like that again.

426
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,416
Because he was the love of my life.

427
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,041
Mozart's your favorite composer?

428
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,541
Well, I have to go with,
um, because I'm a massive fan,

429
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,833
uh, Robert Schumann.

430
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,041
Wait until you hear me play Schubert.

431
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:08,041
Well, I'll have to see that.
I mean, listen to that.

432
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,958
Why didn't you tell me
your son loves Schumann?

433
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,666
He's so cute.

434
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,041
I'm going to the restroom.
Get me more champagne?

435
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,541
Of course, my love.

436
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,333
Were you just checking out my wife?

437
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:27,791
What?

438
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:31,541
You think I'm that stupid? You've been
making passes at her all afternoon.

439
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,458
- I'm just being polite to her.
- You're coming onto her.

440
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:37,750
- Maybe you misunderstood something I did...
- Look me in the eyes.

441
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,708
Do you think she's attractive?

442
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,500
- That's not the point.
- Yes or no, Rafael?

443
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,750
Well, I think she's very... pretty.

444
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,375
Would you make love to my wife?

445
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,875
I'm your father.
I'll know if you're lying.

446
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,916
If the situation wasn't,
uh, like it is right now

447
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,125
and you didn't have a formal,
um, relationship with her, then...

448
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,208
It's flattering that a young man like you

449
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,958
would want to polish
my wife's beautiful thighs.

450
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:07,833
Would you look at that?

451
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,583
See how confusing life can get sometimes?

452
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,666
Paradoxical.

453
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,583
For example,

454
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,958
I could seem like a good parent
if I wanted to work with my son, but...

455
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,875
if that job were a robbery,

456
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,250
probably some prude asshole
would object to it.

457
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,666
I'll never steal with you
in my life, okay?

458
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,666
- I'm an engineer.
- I know.

459
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,125
Electronics, huh?

460
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:36,000
With a post degree in cybersecurity.

461
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,208
MIT, Massachusetts.

462
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:41,916
I paid.

463
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,416
Why do you think I did it?

464
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,875
You...

465
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,125
You are just...

466
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,250
absolutely disgusting

467
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,250
and selfish.

468
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,750
You want a boring life
with schedules, meetings, emails,

469
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:08,250
with those endless shifts
that will completely exhaust your energy?

470
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,750
Then give you a month-long holiday
so you can get a glimpse of some freedom?

471
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,708
You're gonna want a glimpse of freedom
when you go to prison!

472
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,208
In my job,
you don't get killed or go to jail.

473
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,291
Death is simply just a word, a priori.

474
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,750
It comprises everything
that doesn't exist.

475
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:29,125
On the other hand, once you're dead,
you won't remember you were alive.

476
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,083
So that's why you wanted to meet, right?

477
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,166
That's why you wanted to see me again?

478
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,958
You say you love me
but don't care if I get killed.

479
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,041
What I don't want is for you to die
before you've even lived.

480
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,041
What I'm offering you right now

481
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,500
is a guaranteed path to liberty.

482
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,000
With me, you'll find authentic liberation.

483
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,833
And if we ever have to pay a price for it,

484
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,583
then we pay it.

485
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,041
Madrid is not the Bermuda Triangle.

486
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,708
We can't make
an 11-ton helicopter simply disappear.

487
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,166
And Marseille will be watched
by all their radars, their satellites,

488
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,041
even NATO's ballistic missiles.

489
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,291
So as soon as Marseille drops off Lisbon...

490
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:31,875
he'll have nowhere to go.

491
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,666
The helicopter's descending.

492
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,790
- Where is it?
- It's in the countryside.

493
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,791
Near Guadalajara.
It looks like a cattle farm.

494
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,583
- Helicopter's landing!
- Transferring coordinates.

495
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,666
The coordinates, hurry up.

496
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,541
Forty degrees,
33 minutes, 47 seconds, north.

497
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,333
Three degrees,
12 minutes, 34 seconds, due west.

498
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,833
You'll be getting your wife out of trouble
but putting Marseille in a tight spot.

499
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,708
That would be the case, Benjamín,

500
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:42,250
if it wasn't for the continuation
of our astonishing illusionist act.

501
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,333
Police!

502
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,208
Get to the helicopter!

503
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,875
On the ground!

504
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,116
- I'm the owner of the farm.
- On the ground!

505
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,666
- On the ground! Hands on your head!
- Get on the ground!

506
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,416
Clear!

507
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:07,375
- Clear!
- Clear!

508
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:13,541
A guilty person
would never claim damages and losses

509
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,916
in such an indignant, obsessive...

510
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,333
- They've killed my lambs.
- Shut your mouth!

511
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,250
...irritating way.

512
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,208
On your feet!

513
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,541
Your colleague killed my lamb.
Who's gonna pay for it? Huh? Who?

514
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,767
<i>I don't know who did this.
Just stay quiet!</i>

515
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:30,250
- Who the fuck is that?
- Someone who lost a lamb.

516
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,291
<i>He landed on my flock
at a crazy speed. He's nuts!</i>

517
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,500
He was alone?

518
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:37,333
In the helicopter? Yes, he was alone.

519
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:38,958
In the car...

520
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,625
Boris, in the car, how many were there?
Two, right?

521
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:46,208
No, just one. They both left,
but there was only one guy in the car.

522
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,791
The vehicle model?

523
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,375
It was like, uh, a funeral car.

524
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,083
<i>In that moment,
they'll have only one lead, the red Volvo.</i>

525
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:59,958
The cameras back at the National Court
will record it when we get Lisbon out.

526
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,333
And that will be
the exact information you'll give them.

527
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,000
Ask him if it was
a Volvo from the '90s. A red one.

528
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:09,916
Was it a Volvo?

529
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,625
A red station wagon.
The make? I don't know.

530
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,916
Volvo, yeah, Volvo.
It left towards Albolleque.

531
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,333
That will be the climax
of our act of illusionism,

532
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,916
because from that moment on...

533
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,250
...everything will change.

534
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,208
We've got them. It's them.

535
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:34,833
All units, the suspect's in
a Volvo Polar 240, plate number 15318 VCM.

536
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,958
- Captain.
- I'm listening, Colonel.

537
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,416
- Get on the same route and stay on them.
- Copy that.

538
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,166
Miranda, you stay here.
Everyone, we're leaving. Go!

539
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,250
Open communication.

540
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,416
Squad, update me on the situation.

541
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,625
- <i>It's two kilometers away.</i>
- We have to stop that car.

542
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,708
Attention, suspect vehicle
approaching at 1,500 meters.

543
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,166
Come on, come on!

544
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,416
Suspect vehicle approaching
at 1,000 meters.

545
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,458
Careful, everyone. This is the Professor.

546
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,541
He could have a smoke bomb
or God knows what. He's fucking Houdini.

547
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,500
Vehicle approaching
at 500 meters. Increasing speed.

548
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:55,208
We have visual. Ready to fire.

549
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:01,458
Stop the vehicle!
Stop the car, you son of a bitch!

550
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,833
- Shoot the wheels off the fucking car!
- Fire!

551
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,083
<i>Exit the vehicle!</i>

552
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,250
Get out, now!

553
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,500
Out of the fucking car!

554
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,125
Get out of the car!

555
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,166
Explosives!

556
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,500
On the ground!

557
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,000
What's going on?

558
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,708
They've got my wife!

559
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,125
- Is it the Professor?
- We were kidnapped.

560
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,166
We were coming out of the salon.

561
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,875
A woman was kidnapped
on her way out of the salon.

562
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:42,208
We should make a report
or else no one will pay for my lamb.

563
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,916
Just shut the fuck up
and go back to doing your work.

564
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,583
After, while you're pretending

565
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,041
that you're going back
to your work on the farm...

566
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,583
Come on, we should go feed the cattle now.

567
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,625
...we'll leave.

568
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,666
Looks like
we've been tricked again, Colonel.

569
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,916
<i>♪ The night seems to fade ♪</i>

570
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,958
<i>♪ But the moonlight lingers on ♪</i>

571
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:39,541
<i>♪ There are wonders for everyone ♪</i>

572
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,708
MUSEUM OF GOLD

573
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:52,250
What about all this gold,
are we not gonna melt it too?

574
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,583
This gold was stolen once.
It can't be stolen again.

575
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,750
It belongs to the Quimbayas,
the Incas, the Quechuas...

576
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:05,250
If anything, we should give it back,
don't you think? It's a treasure.

577
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,791
Well, treasure is treasure.

578
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,833
My son could have made one of these,
and he's two.

579
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,750
- Think about it.
- Come on, Denver.

580
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:24,833
Lisbon to Professor.

581
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,708
Hurry up.

582
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:30,166
- Hurry up. They'll be worried.
<i>- Professor, check-up call.</i>

583
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,250
<i>I'm here.</i>

584
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:47,916
Hi, Sergio.

585
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,833
<i>Plan Paris was a success.</i>

586
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,375
We're launching Plan Rome.

587
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,833
In an hour, we'll start the extraction.

588
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,208
There will be no extraction.

589
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,750
It's possible this is the last time
I'll speak to all of you.

590
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,208
The stormwater tank has been discovered.

591
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,875
What happens
if someone finds the stormwater tank?

592
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,083
It's the finale.

593
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,458
<i>Hi, Lisbon.</i>

594
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,791
<i>Hey, Tokyo, Helsinki...</i>

595
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:31,333
Well, hello to every single one
of those cities you're named after

596
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,166
but will never have the chance to visit.

597
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,291
Who's that?

598
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,500
It's Inspector Sierra.

599
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,916
- She's in charge of the investigation.
- Something like that. What's up, Raquel?

600
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,583
I guess you're in the middle
of an emotional roller coaster, right?

601
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:46,375
<i>Earlier... you were arrested in the tent.</i>

602
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:49,375
Then you were flying around
like a little bird, right? Free.

603
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,125
And suddenly it hits you, bang!

604
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,041
<i>Everything's over.</i>

605
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,666
But we both knew all of this had a price.

606
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,375
<i>Well,</i>

607
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,958
the time has come to pay it.

608
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:04,208
The price could be really high, Dad.

609
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,958
Because when it's time to pay,
you're not here,

610
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,916
in a luxury restaurant,
eating a lobster, no.

611
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,291
You're in a police van.

612
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,083
And your life,
everything you've built, just...

613
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,750
disappears.

614
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,750
Or worse, you're covered in blood, dead...

615
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,791
like your father, remember?

616
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,708
The things that are really important
in life, Rafael, have a high price.

617
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,583
Rebellion.

618
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,125
Liberty.

619
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,166
Ideals.

620
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,208
Do you have any last words, Professor?

621
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,750
I'm sorry, Raquel.

622
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,083
I'm really sorry, Rio.

623
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,250
I'm so sorry, Palermo.

624
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,250
I'm really sorry, Helsinki.

625
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:29,916
I'm sorry, Manila.

626
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,791
I'm sorry, Bogotá.

627
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,958
I'm really sorry, Stockholm.

628
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,750
<i>I'm sorry, Denver.</i>

629
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,666
I'm really sorry, Tokyo.

630
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,041
- I'm really so sorry.
- Enough.

631
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,583
Hey. That's enough.

632
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,208
Professor,

633
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,000
don't feel so bad, hmm?

634
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,333
There are no big battles
without big opponents.

635
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:15,458
And I mean, you guys,
I could talk for hours.

636
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:17,833
<i>We could do a group therapy session</i>

637
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:20,208
<i>or we could talk about
all your clever tactics,</i>

638
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,041
<i>like the ferret through the sewers.</i>

639
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,875
Hilarious.

640
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,583
But the thing is,
we have a lot to discuss over here.

641
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,041
Okay? Over and out, my cute gangsters.

642
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:52,666
There's got to be a plan B.
The Professor always has plan B.

643
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,000
Not this time.

644
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,250
There's no plan B.

645
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,541
He's so arrogant he doesn't have a plan B?

646
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,208
He has one for everything,
but not in case <i>he</i> fails?

647
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,375
I don't think he's that stupid.

648
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:05,666
What would you suggest?
There's only one way to get the gold out.

649
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,500
There's no plan B
because only plan A can work.

650
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,791
We're up against the ropes.

651
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:23,000
But we're not gonna end up in the morgue.

652
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,458
The army!

653
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,458
The military.

654
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,083
A lot of soldiers.

655
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:44,916
<i>In that moment,
it felt as if we were hitting a wall</i>

656
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,166
<i>at 150 kilometers per hour.</i>

657
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,750
<i>The end of the road.</i>

658
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,666
<i>We all experience that
at some point in our lives.</i>

659
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:09,708
<i>One day your brother
is diagnosed with a terminal illness.</i>

660
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:20,208
<i>One day you realize
you won't ever see your child again.</i>

661
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,250
<i>That you won't see your friends again.</i>

662
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,250
<i>Or your unrequited love.</i>

663
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:37,625
Papa.

664
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,541
<i>Or that you'll never hug
your father again.</i>

665
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,583
René!

666
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:48,666
René!

667
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:52,166
<i>Other days,
you're leaving a bank with your boyfriend</i>

668
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,166
<i>and a bullet takes him away from you.</i>

669
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,125
No!

670
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:57,708
<i>Your family...</i>

671
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:01,000
<i>won't ever see each other again.</i>

672
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:05,416
<i>Everything we experienced
while dressed in red</i>

673
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,750
<i>was coming to a close.</i>

674
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,541
<i>This was the end of our journey together.</i>
