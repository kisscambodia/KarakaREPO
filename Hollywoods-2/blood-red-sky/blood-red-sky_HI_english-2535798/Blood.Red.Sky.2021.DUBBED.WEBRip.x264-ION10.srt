00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,760
we've vacated the runway
for landing for you.

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,520
You are on line one, four, zero, four.

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,080
Keep a low angle.

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,640
Seventeen-degree approach is fine.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,280
Now extend the landing gear.

Welcome to our airbase, sir.
Everything is cleared.

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,800
The plane is approaching.
We assume captain and copilot are dead.

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,160
Thank you. Keep your men back.
We'll take it from here.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,600
-Alan, together again. What's the status?
-We checked the passenger manifest.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
At least one passenger on board
is on the German terrorist watch list.

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,240
The sniper team is already in position.

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,360
One there, one around the back.
I'll let you two crack on.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,760
Leave the autopilot on.
I'll give you step-by-step instructions.

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,280
-Watch your approach angle.
-As you were.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,720
-There it is.
-Turn off the autopilot now.

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Just make sure the nose on the altitude
indicator doesn't sink below the horizon.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,200
Watch your approach angle. Not so steep!

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,920
[pilot] It'll bump a little on landing,
but don't worry.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,960
As soon as you touch down,
keep both feet on the brakes.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,640
Step on the brakes!

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,400

-He's talking about an explosive device.

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
[man on plane]
Don't trigger until we are safe.

51
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,600
-[woman] He wants to ignite when safe.
-Explosives on board.

52
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,920
I repeat, explosives on board.
Take all appropriate safety measures.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560

Don't shoot.

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600

Do not move.
We will open fire at the first movement.

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,680
I repeat. If you move, we will open fire.

Hands on your head.

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,840
Now slowly climb into the pilot seat.

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
Put the headset on.
And very, very slowly, show me your hands.

70
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,480
Let me get out.
I'll explain everything to you.

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,600
No, you'll do what I tell you to.

72
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,280
You have to believe me. I'm no terrorist.

I will help you
when you let the passengers off the plane.

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,840
How many terrorists are there?
How are they armed? Is anyone hurt?

77
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,480
I need to know as much as possible
before I send my men in there.

[TV reporter] The Dow Jones in the USA.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,760
Worldwide, the markets are showing
an eight percent surge in only one week,

92
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,120
driven mainly
by the airline stock numbers.

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
Analysts predict
a strong course correction,

94
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,560
which means the market might face
some instability for some time.

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
So in spite of the market's current high,

96
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,960
it's still a risky moment
in terms of investment opportunity.

97
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,640
That volatility is also confirmed by

98
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,440
the fact that gold
is at a new seven-year high.

99
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,240

innovation for businesses and malls.

Okay, look, we're here.

160
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,400
It's night here.
And New York is over there, to the west.

It's day there now.
And we're flying this way,

but the earth turns this way.

He can kill off her bad blood

[grunts]

537
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,800
[Karl] Move it.

538
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,400
Sit down. Sit your ass down.

539
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
Hey! Where-- where are you going? Stop!

540
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
Hey! Stop, I said!

541
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
[Elias weeping]

542
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,520

[panting]

548
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,880
[squelching, crackling]

549
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,080
Already?

550
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
[eerie music playing]

551
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,680
[whimpering]

552
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,400
[hijacker 2] Jurij, come in.

553
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,240
Is the jump prepped?

554
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,040
Jurij, come in. Do you read me?

555
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,360
Ten minutes to jump.
What's the status of the charge?

556
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,800
Jurij, you Czech bastard. Do you hear me?

557
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,320
Where the hell are you?

558
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,760
[dog barking]

559
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,760
[growls]

560
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,760
[barking]

561
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,720
[sucking]

562
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,960
[dogs barking]

563
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,720
[gasps, spits]

[growls]

566
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,560
[barking]

567
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,240
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time
for us to say goodbye to you now.

568
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,160
For our own safety and protection,
we booby-trapped this plane.

569
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,120
If anyone should rush forward
or try to follow us,

570
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,840
a toxic nerve gas will be released.

571
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,960
In that case, please use your gas masks.

572
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,680
Just put it slightly over your nose
and breathe normal.

573
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,680
Oh, sorry, that's right.
You don't have any gas masks.

574
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,240
[laughing]

575
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,480
So, please observe the fasten
seat belt signs above your heads,

576
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,280
and remain seated
for the rest of the flight.

577
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,040
We realize that you have
a choice of airlines

578
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,240
and would like to thank you
for flying with Transatlantic tonight.

579
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,600
Good night. Sleep tight.

580
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,760
Nice flight.

581
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,800
-Hair spray cans?
-[hijacker 2 laughs]

582
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,480
Nice try.

583
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,680
[Hightower] Fake it 'til you make it.

584
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,560
-Put your mask on.
-[Karl] There's no need for it.

585
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
[speaking indistinctly]

586
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
Jurij!

587
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,360
Where the fuck are you?

588
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,080
Oh whoa.

589
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,000
Oh wow.

590
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,280
What the hell happened to you?

591
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,600
[whining]

592
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,360
[door closes]

593
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,920
[panting]

594
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,640
Elias! Elias!

595
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,320
Mama. Mama. Mama.

596
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,320
You can't do that. You can't do that.

597
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,480
Go back to your seats!

598
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,040
Okay.

599
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,040
-I thought you were dead.
-Everything is fine, honey.

600
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,600
We have to turn the plane around,
then everything will be fine.

601
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,880
Go, go.

602
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,200
Don't… Don't look over there.

603
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,000
Don't look.

604
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,960
Fuck.

605
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
[bleeping]

606
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,080
Forty-three miles to target area.

607
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,560
[mom] Where is the pilot?

608
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,880
The pilot, where is he?

609
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,720
[speaking indistinctly]

610
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,160
The pilot is dead.

611
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,720
[passengers gasping]

612
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,280
[speaking indistinctly]

613
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,200
[mom] Okay.

614
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,080
Does anyone… Does anyone on board
know how to fly a plane?

615
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,240
[shouting]
Is there anyone here who knows how to fly?

616
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,640
Answer me!

617
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,040
Is there anyone who knows
how to fly a fucking plane?

618
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,080
-[Rainer] What are you doing?
-I'm an aerospace engineering student.

619
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,960
Sit down! They'll kill all of us.

620
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,800
We're gonna die anyway.

621
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,160
[woman] What? What are you talking about?

622
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,640
An Arab student with flight experience
fits the profile perfectly.

623
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,360
Brother, why New York?

624
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,240
-I'm going to a convention.
-Move.

625
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,880
-[Farid] Me too.
-Come on. Come on.

626
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,200
They set us up.
They made us read a statement

627
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,760
saying we wanted
to crash the airplane in London.

628
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,640
Either we die
or the British shoot us down.

629
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,520
-Nonsense. They're not terrorists.
-Oh yeah?

630
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,080
Why? Because they don't have beards
and pray towards Mecca?

631
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
They want to influence the stock market.

632
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,560
The market's overheated.

633
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,040
When another 9/11 happens,
prices will tank.

634
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,840
You could make billions from shorting.

635
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
He thinks
they wanna crash the stock market.

636
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,880
Like that bombing a few years ago.
The soccer club.

637
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,720
They want to change
the outcome of the election.

638
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,440
Whatever. If we don't do anything,
we're gonna die. That's for sure.

639
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,240
We have to do something now.

640
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,400
Just before the election.
Remember Madrid 2004?

641
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,000
[suspenseful music playing]

642
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,760
I've spent a few hours
on a flight simulator, but I…

643
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,840
Hey…

644
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,160
T-minus ten minutes to drop zone,
awaiting go.

645
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,040
-[man] We're on position.
-Got it.

646
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,520
[Karl] Who are those guys down there?

647
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,000
-I don't want to end up as shark bait.
-Make sure you have your GPS on.

648
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,880
[Karl] Who's going to get his mil?

649
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,440
[mom] It'll be all right. I promise.

650
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,440
Hey.

651
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,360
[Elias] Did you drink blood?

652
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,840
You have to take your medicine.

653
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,560
Hey, everything okay in there?

654
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,040
That wasn't me.

655
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,360
[rattling]

656
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,560
They've got the autopilot on.

657
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,760
[mom] Don't.

658
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,200
Let them jump first.

659
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,960
She's alive.

660
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
[passengers speaking indistinctly]

661
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,960
[hijacker 2] Where is she?

662
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,160
They're in the cockpit.

663
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,320
No, wait!

664
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,040
-[Hightower] Get the fuck back to economy.
-Shit.

665
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,600
Shit.

666
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,520
Open the door!

667
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,600
-Turn the plane around.
-[student] What?

668
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,400
I said turn the plane around!

669
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,880
[student] We're closer
to Europe right now.

670
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,760
[beeping]

671
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,640
Shit!

672
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,880
[grunts]

673
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,040
Open the door!

674
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,760
[Mom growls]

675
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,960
[growling] Turn around! Now!

676
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,400
[breathing heavily]

677
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,600
They're turning.

678
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,200
-One!
-No, please don't!

679
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,600
-Please don't!
-Two!

680
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,200
Three!

681
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,320
[firing]

682
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,080
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

683
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,120
[weeps]

684
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,840
[hijacker 2] We got 200 more passengers
on this plane.

685
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,680
We can play this game all night long.

686
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,840
Give me another one.

687
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,200
What the fuck you looking at? Go!

688
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,560
[gasps] No! Please, don't. Please, don't.

689
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,520
-I'm begging you, please.
-No!

690
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,840
[crying]

691
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,160
[Karl] Stop it, you psycho!
What the fuck are you doing?

692
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,680
Put the fucking knife away,
or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head.

693
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,400
[hijacker 2] Why is this taking so long?
Get me another passenger.

694
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,160
Sit down. Sit back. Put your hands up.

695
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,720
[wailing] No!

696
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,120
-[Karl] Put your hands up!
-[woman] No!

697
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,720
What?

698
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,960
[woman] No!

-[man] Where the fuck are you?
-Delayed. Will transmit new coordinates.

701
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,880
Fuck!

702
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,680
All these deaths,

703
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,520
they're on your hands.

704
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,640
[girl crying]

705
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,240
Sweetheart.

706
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,040
It's okay.

707
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,600
Do you wanna see
who drives the plane? Come on.

708
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,800
[girl continues crying]

709
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,200

1083
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,480
Quick!

1084
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,000

[snarls]

1086
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,680
[Elias] Help me!

1087
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,200
We need heavy people
to weigh down the hatch!

1088
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,680
What did he say?

1089
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,080
What do you want?

1090
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,280
[growls]

1091
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,320
Help me! Help!

1092
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,720
[screaming]

1093
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,760

1094
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,920

[strains]

1097
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,120
Help! help! Fuck!

1098
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:28,960
[Elias] No!

1099
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,640
Stop! Don't bite him!

1100
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,680
Stop! Go away! Don't drink his blood!

1101
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,160
What the fuck?

1102
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,320
[Nadja] Elias.

1103
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,040
Elias, get back. He's dangerous.

1104
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,320
He wants to be healed, just like you!

1105
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,760
[growls]

1106
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,240
-Don't!
-Keep calm, Elias!

1107
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,920
Right here.

1108
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,440
[roaring]

1109
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,480
[Farid moans]

1110
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,560
My hand got caught in the cargo hold door.

1111
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,800
And your mom helped me.

1112
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,120
Come.

1113
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,640
Elias. Let's go.

1114
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,320
We need a doctor.

1115
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,760
We need a doctor!

1116
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,240
I'm a doctor!

1117
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,480
[clamoring]

1118
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,040
No, it's not about me.
There's a guy in the rear who's worse off.

1119
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,320
[passengers shouting]

1120
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,520
[Farid] Don't worry. She's on our side!

1121
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,600
[passengers screaming]

1122
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,720
We got everything under control!
Don't worry!

[grunts]

1124
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,280
[Nadja] Turn the plane around.

1125
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,200
-Do it!
-I have to check our course.

1126
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,120
-We're below cruising altitude.
-Mom.

1127
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,040
-Mom.
-What's going on?

1128
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,120
She wants us to fly to New York.
But we're too low and short on fuel.

1129
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,120
We have to divert to the nearest airport,
or we'll crash into the ocean.

1130
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,320
-Turn the plane!
-Hey, we can't make it to New York.

1131
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,400
Do you understand?

1132
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,440
You got to help me.

1133
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,240
Please, help me. I'll pay you.

1134
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,840
Don't worry. I'll help you.

[groans in pain]

1136
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,920
[Elias] It's dark down there.

1137
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,120
Come on. Let's go.

1138
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,400
[Bastian] This is Transatlantic 473.

1139
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,160
Do you read me?

1140
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,720
Transatlantic 473.

1141
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,000
Anybody read me?

1142
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,560
They wanted to blow down the door.

1143
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,880
Watch out, it's on!

1144
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,560
Not anymore.

1145
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,560
It's gonna be fine. We'll wait until dark
and catch the next plane to New York.

1146
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,640
Mom, look how far we've come.

1147
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,440
Mom!

1148
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,480
Please, we can do it.

1149
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,720

1151
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:31,760
Thank you.

1152
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,960
Thank you, guys.

1153
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,400
If the pain gets worse,
take two more pills.

1154
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,240
-Okay, thank you.
-Okay. I take care of the broker.

1155
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,160
How is he?

1156
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,520
He has massive interior bleeding.

1157
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,400
[controller] This is Lossiemouth tower.

1158
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,000
You've left your assigned course.
Please identify yourself immediately.

1159
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,560
[hijacker 3] This airplane is now
under our control.

1160
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,080
We are faithful soldiers of the Caliphate,

1161
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,280
who have abandoned this life to stri--

1162
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:11,160
This is Transatlantic 473.
Transatlantic 473.

1163
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,160
I am the second officer.
My name is Bastian Buchner.

1164
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,040
We have been hijacked.
The captain is dead.

1165
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,480
[controller]
Transatlantic 473, please repeat.

1166
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,040
I said we have been hijacked.
The captain is dead.

1167
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:23,920
[controller] Are you in danger?

1168
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,960
Negative. We overpowered the hijackers,
and we locked them in the cargo hold.

1169
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,840
I'm so cold.

1170
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,560
You've got a kidney rupture.
I can't stop the bleeding.

1171
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,120
What does this mean?

1172
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,000
-I'll get you something for the pain.
-Stay here.

1173
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,760
You've got to help me.

1174
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,960
I'll pay you.

1175
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,400
A million dollars.

1176
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,560
Your money isn't going
to help you now either.

1177
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,680
I'm sorry.

1178
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,680
She'll be right back.

1179
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,240

1183

Don't worry. He's not going to get up.

1192
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,160
Bite me.

1193
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,840
Please.

1194
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,040

1198
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,120
Perfect. I'll give you the address
as soon as we land.

1199
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,320
Goodbye.

1200
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,240
Dr. Brown will make sure
to get the Cytarabine.

1201
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,720
That way we'll have enough time
to plan the next flight.

1202

Fuck!

01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,800
-What's wrong?
-[Farid] I don't know. Something's wrong.

-Bastian!
-[Elias] What's wrong?

1209
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,080
Go down. Go.

1210
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,000
Wait, I'll help you.

1211
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,120
Hey, what are you doing?

1212
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,760
We can help them!
We can hide them down there!

1213
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,360
If we open the door,
then we'll never get it shut again.

1214
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,320
Fuck!

1215
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,480
[clamoring]

1216
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,200
Let us in! Please, let us in!

-Please.
-[straining]

1218
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,000
[Julia] Please, we're gonna die out here!
Please let us in!

1219
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,920
We can't land.

1220
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,360
What do you mean it shouldn't land?
You wanna crash the plane or what?

1221
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,440
They'll hide in the cargo bay
till it's dark, then get out, all of them.

1222
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,240
We have to inform the authorities.

1223
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,920
What? And tell them what?
We have vampires on board?

1224
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,600
No, no, no, we have to--

1225
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,880
We have to land and then jump.

1226
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,960
Here. If we attach this to the fuel tank,

1227
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,000
it'll be enough
to blow up the whole plane.

1228
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,160
How do we get there?

1229
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,160
-That's the fuel tank.
-[Farid] Fuck. Shit.

1230
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,720
What?

1231
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,600
The detonator doesn't have a timer.
Do you have a remote?

1232
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:03,680
-[Bastian] Yeah. Curtiz had it.
-[Farid] Where is it?

1233
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,240
-Where is that asshole? Fuck.
-[Bastian] In the rear cargo hold.

1234
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,080
Okay.

1235
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,920
-Does this lead to the back?
-[Bastian] Yeah.

1236
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,400
Man!

1237
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,880
Shit, it's way too narrow.

1238
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,520
Is there another way to detonate it?

1239
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,640
Yeah, but then we'll blow up too.

1240
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,120
You land the plane.

1241
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,600
And as soon as you're out,

1242
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,720
I'll blow it up.

1243
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,840
No, Mama!

1244
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,640
-Yes, Elias.
-We can get you out of here.

1245
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:43,200
-You can hide in here.
-Elias, we have no other choice.

1246
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,120
Okay?

1247
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,120
-I can fit there. I can get the remote.
-Elias, it's over!

1248
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,520
You hear me?

1249
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,480
-Forgive me, please.
-I can get past them with this.

1250
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,320
Give me-- [screams]

1251
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,320
Stay here, Elias! Shit!

1252
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,760

1259

He'll make it. Look, he'll make it.

1260
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,120
Look.

1263
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,480
That's the remote control.

1264
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,400
Elias, can you hear me?

1265
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,760
The cell phone is the remote control.

1266
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,840
Be careful. Don't press the big button.

1267
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,480
Elias, come back.
Elias, you hear me? Come back.

1268
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,960

1274
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
How hard is it to land the plane?

1275
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,800
What? Why? We'll make it.

1276
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,360
I entered the coordinates. We'll fly
to the destination automatically.

1277
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,120
And the landing?

1278
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,760
You have to stay in the air corridor
then put on the brakes.

1279
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,080
The rest is no problem.

1280
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,400
-Can you handle it?
-What?

1281
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,960
[Bastian] Anyone can do this

even with one hand.

1283
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,520
You have to look after my son.

1284
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,080
What do you mean?

1285
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,160

The police have him under control.

What are your orders, Commander?

1374
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,480

Don't you understand?

1381
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,280
You have to let me get out of here.

1382
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,800
Now!

1383
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,440
Or it will be too late.

That is one tough bastard.
