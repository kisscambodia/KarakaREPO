1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,125
<i>Well, after graduation,</i>

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:24,541
<i>Noah, Lee, Rachel and I decided
to take one week and go on a road trip,</i>

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,125
<i>just the four of us.</i>

4
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,791
<i>And while I was busy putting off
the inevitable decision</i>

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,791
<i>between the two colleges
where I got accepted...</i>

6
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,166
So, what about you?

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,000
I... I got wait-listed.

8
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,666
Both Berkeley and Harvard.

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,666
<i>I was fully focused on making sure
we all had as much fun as possible.</i>

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,458
<i>And that's exactly what we did.</i>

11
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,458
<i>Let me run you through the highlights.</i>

12
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>On our way up to Northern California,
we camped in the woods.</i>

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,708
- Hey!
<i>- Went fishing on a lake.</i>

14
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,791
<i>Fed some wildlife,
caught some waves at Big Sur.</i>

15
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,958
<i>Watched Noah becoming friends with Rachel.</i>

16
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,541
<i>Watched Lee watch Noah
becoming friends with Rachel.</i>

17
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,583
<i>Watched a shooting star
with someone special.</i>

18
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,666
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>Saw the fish at the aquarium in Monterey.</i>

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,666
<i>Saw a sunset with colors
I had never seen before.</i>

21
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,250
<i>And got a reminder
about rule number 19.</i>

22
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,416
<i>Decided to think about it later.</i>

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,083
<i>Drove to San Francisco.</i>

24
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,583
<i>Went to Fisherman's Wharf.</i>

25
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,083
<i>Ate clam chowder out of a bread bowl.</i>

26
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,434
<i>Watched the sea lions on Pier 39.</i>

27
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,875
<i>Watched our naughty video
from chemistry lab.</i>

28
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,226
<i>Destroyed our naughty video
from chemistry lab.</i>

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,625
<i>Rode tandem bikes in Golden Gate Park.</i>

30
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,208
<i>Rode a speedboat in the bay.</i>

31
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,958
<i>Caught a movie.</i>

32
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,333
<i>Caught a concert.</i>

33
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,375
<i>Even caught a baseball
in a kayak outside Oracle Park...</i>

34
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,541
Whoa, whoa!

35
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,208
- It's coming!
- I got it!

36
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,333
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

37
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,166
Oh, my God!

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,875
Oh, my God!

39
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,958
<i>But the absolute best
was watching the Bay Lights</i>

40
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,708
<i>with my favorite two guys in the world.</i>

41
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,125
<i>But when you decide to escape reality,</i>

42
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,750
<i>you know that eventually
you're gonna have to come back to it.</i>

43
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,666
<i>So, when we got back home,</i>

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,666
<i>I got a job so I could make some money
for college,</i>

45
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,541
<i>whichever one I wind up going to.</i>

46
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,458
Oh, hey, guys...

47
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,708
<i>But as hard as that was for me to decide,</i>

48
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,458
<i>a few days later</i>,
<i>things got even more complicated</i>

49
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,208
<i>when Noah asked
a very unexpected question...</i>

50
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,125
Mmm!

51
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,208
So, anyway, I was thinking, uh...

52
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,611
when you get off the wait-list
for Harvard, maybe you and I

53
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,625
could go off-campus
and get an apartment together.

54
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,416
Wait. You mean, like...
like, get our own place?

55
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,750
Yeah, look.

56
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,958
I've been online all day.
There's some pretty cool places.

57
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,791
What?

58
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,458
- You wanna live with me?
- No.

59
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,125
Yes, of course I wanna live
with you. I wanna do everything with you.

60
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,208
- Really?
- Yes, really.

61
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,166
- How long do we have till Lee gets back?
- I don't know.

62
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,166
Geronimo!

63
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,166
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, shit!

64
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,791
- Hey, guys. Look what I got.
- Ooh!

65
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

66
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,125
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

67
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,208
Is everything okay?

68
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,083
Yeah, fine.

69
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,000
- Um, in fact...
- Hmm.

70
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,684
- Yes, I would like that very much.
- Yeah, I thought you might.

71
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,500
- See you.
- Where are you two going?

72
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,458
Hmm. Noah wants to read me poetry
and tell me all about his feelings.

73
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,684
Really? Is that what you wanna go with?

74
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,875
Smooth move!

75
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,125
Oh, I wanted to show this to you.

76
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,291
What is it?

77
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,708
I have painstakingly coordinated
my Berkeley schedule

78
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,333
with your Rhode Island School of Design
schedule.

79
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,267
- Aww.
- First up, we've got Labor Day.

80
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,166
I know it's early in the semester,
but it's a long weekend,

81
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,708
and I'm pretty damn sure
I'm gonna be having my Rachel withdrawals.

82
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,208
That could work.

83
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,083
Of course it'll work. We'll make it work.

84
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,541
Okay.

85
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,916
This place is so nice.
Thank you for bringing us here.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,541
Well, we wanted
to finally take you somewhere special

87
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,500
to help celebrate your graduation.

88
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,333
So, any big plans for the summer?

89
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,250
Well, actually, now that you mention it,

90
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,333
we were all talking about heading over
to the beach house this weekend,

91
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,708
if that's cool.

92
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
Is everything okay?

93
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,583
Yeah, everything's fine.
Um, we just have some news for you.

94
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,000
We are planning to sell the beach house.

95
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,833
What?!

96
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,208
It doesn't make sense
to hold on to it anymore.

97
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,541
Now that you kids
are going off to college.

98
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,791
You know, the upkeep
on the place is hardly worth it

99
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,500
since we're not even gonna be there.

100
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,166
Truth is
the whole area is being redeveloped.

101
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,083
You know what you sound like, Mom?
You sound like a realtor.

102
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,041
That's because I <i>am</i> a realtor.

103
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,625
Wait, so where are we gonna watch
the fireworks on the Fourth of July?

104
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,308
No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.
You guys are not selling.

105
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,625
I gotta go with Lee on this one.

106
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,250
This house has been in our family
for, like, 80 years.

107
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,416
You can't just get rid of it like that.

108
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,541
Is this a vote? Because I vote "no."

109
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,125
I'm sorry, guys.

110
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,875
It's been decided.

111
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,875
I'll be right back.

112
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,416
Hello?

113
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,041
<i>Miss Evans, this is Don Washington
from UC Berkeley's admissions.</i>

114
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,916
<i>I'm following up
on your decision regarding Berkeley.</i>

115
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,875
Uh, yes. Hi.

116
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:31,166
Um, is there any way
I could just get another small extension?

117
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,958
<i>I'm very sorry, Miss Evans,</i>

118
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,041
<i>but we need your decision
by end of business day tomorrow.</i>

119
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,250
<i>I knew that I couldn't hide
from it any longer.</i>

120
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,875
Uh, okay. I understand.

121
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,291
- Thank you.
<i>- All right.</i>

122
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,250
<i>The next day,
I had to pick a school</i>

123
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,916
<i>and make one
of my two favorite people very unhappy.</i>

124
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,916
I'ma hit you with a "draw four,"
"draw two." Uno, Uno out.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,458
- Oh, no!
- What? Gosh!

126
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,958
Let's go.

127
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,625
- Did he cheat?
- Unh-unh.

128
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,291
Aww. I miss this.

129
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,208
I feel like I barely see you guys anymore.

130
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,625
Yeah, I know.

131
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,875
- They're keeping you busy at work.
- Very busy.

132
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,291
But don't worry,
I'm still good to babysit tomorrow.

133
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:11,750
Do you think you're gonna be working
a lot of weekends with this new job?

134
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,875
Uh, yeah, looks that way.

135
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,833
Uh, but I'm not working tomorrow night.

136
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,208
I got a date.

137
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,916
<i>A date?</i>

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,916
- Really?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,416
Um, how many dates have you been on
with this mystery person?

140
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,041
A few. Her name is Linda.

141
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,000
Interesting.

142
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,500
Well, obviously, we,

143
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:38,208
Brad, are gonna have
to give you a curfew, young man.

144
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay. Understood, ma'am.

145
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,750
<i>The next day,
we all drove down to the beach house</i>

146
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,708
<i>to do something
I never thought I'd have to do.</i>

147
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,375
<i>Help the Flynns get ready to sell it.</i>

148
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,875
<i>I had spent literally every summer
of my childhood</i>

149
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,458
<i>hanging out here with Lee and Noah.</i>

150
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,541
<i>And the idea this would be
our last summer here together</i>

151
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,500
<i>was just hitting me.</i>

152
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,958
<i>I was really
gonna miss this old place</i>

153
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,791
<i>in ways I hadn't even realized yet.</i>

154
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,375
<i>♪...things I've never done ♪</i>

155
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:34,541
<i>♪ Welcome home ♪</i>

156
00:07:53,791 --> 00:08:00,666

157
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,708
Oh.

158
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:04,791
Oh.

159
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,851
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, don't worry about it.

160
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,955
It's always been like that.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,083
- Oh.
- Oh, man.

162
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,125
This is funny. Elle and I,
we used to pretend this was a diamond.

163
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,375
And we would, like, pretend to steal it.

164
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,250
It was like this big jewel heist.

165
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,375
<i>♪ I don't need them anymore ♪</i>

166
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:30,041

167
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,166
Look how young we all were.

168
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,250
What's weird is it doesn't feel like
all that long ago to me.

169
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,583
You should keep that one.
Mom would like that.

170
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,625
Maybe I will.

171
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,708
Hey, we were thinking
about ordering a pizza.

172
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,333
- Does that sound good?
- Yes, absolutely.

173
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:09,208
In the meantime, could you get started
packing up the rumpus room?

174
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,041
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

175
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,791
- Yes.
- Yeah, all right.

176
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,666
Come on.

177
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,916
Whoa!

178
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,625
Okey dokey.
Here's what we should do.

179
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,333
We need to make one pile
for the stuff we wanna keep

180
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,791
and then another pile for things
we wanna put in bags and donate.

181
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,833
<i>♪ It's time to work... ♪</i>

182
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,356
I wanna keep that one. Yep.

183
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,500
Yep.

184
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,500
That is your hand.

185
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,041
- Nope.
- Yep.

186
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,875
- Oh, you cheater!
- Oh!

187
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,083
Well, that was productive.

188
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,966
Wait. Oh, my God!
I just remembered something.

189
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,500
- Oh, my God. It's still here!
- Our Mario Kart lunch box!

190
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,708
What?! Oh, my...

191
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,375
No!

192
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,416
Wait. Is that what I think it is?

193
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,166
- It's our beach bucket list!
- What?

194
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,083
Oh, my God!

195
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,166
<i>A long time ago,</i>

196
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,125
<i>Lee and I put together a list of all
the crazy things we wanted to do together</i>

197
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,833
<i>before going to college.</i>

198
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,333
<i>It was all of our childhood
summertime dreams and fantasies</i>

199
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,541
<i>listed out
on one very important piece of paper.</i>

200
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,375
- Damn. We put together a solid list.
<i>- </i>Yeah, we did.

201
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,541
We could get arrested for that one.

202
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,125
- Uh, yeah, no, uh, we actually could.
- Wow!

203
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,500
So, how long does it usually take
to sell a house out here?

204
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,458
Well, we have to put it on the market,

205
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,625
but, you know, maybe two or three months.

206
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,666
That's gonna be a real hassle
running out here all the time, though.

207
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,791
What do you mean?

208
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,416
Well, we have to meet with the appraisers,

209
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,125
surveyors, contractors
and the people looking to buy the place.

210
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,500
Well, gee,
that does sound like a real hassle.

211
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,916
Yeah, especially, you know,
with all the road work that's coming up.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,750
I mean that traffic on the freeway,
back and forth and back and forth

213
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,541
and back and forth.

214
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,225
Not to mention all that cleaning.

215
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,541
And constantly driving up
to check on the work that's being done.

216
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,583
Okay, what are you kids getting at?

217
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,625
I am so glad that you asked,
dear parent of mine.

218
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,500
Since this is our last summer here
at the beach house,

219
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,708
and since, like you said,

220
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,208
you're gonna need someone here,
help coordinating some stuff.

221
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,583
We would be more than happy
to stay here for you.

222
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,041
But we would take
amazing care of the place.

223
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,750
So, what do you say?

224
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,208
- We'll talk about it.
- That's a yes! Ha ha ha!

225
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,958
Wait. Not so fast, man.
Not so fast. Deal isn't closed yet.

226
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,500
Guys.

227
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,000
Um...

228
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,083
Come on.

229
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,791
- Okay.
- Yes! Yes!

230
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,083
But this place needs
to be absolutely spotless.

231
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,541
- I mean it.
- Well, yeah, yeah. Of course.

232
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,916
It shall be done.
Your wish is our command.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,517
- Okay.
- I love you.

234
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,767
- Have I told you told that recently?
- I'll be right back.

235
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,416
Not a worry in the world.
We got you, Ma. You're the best.

236
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,246
<i>Admissions. Berkeley.</i>

237
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,916
Hi. Uh, this is Elle Evans. I'm...

238
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

239
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,833
Yeah, I'm just calling to let you know
that I've... I've made a decision.

240
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,041
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

241
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,166
- Yeah.
- Okay.

242
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,083
What's going on?

243
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,416
I got off the wait-list.

244
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,583
Harvard.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,166
- What? Ha ha!
- Ooh!

246
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,666
Wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
Put me down. Put me down.

247
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,041
Oh, shit.

248
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,333
Crap.

249
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,458
Hang on.

250
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,250
Lee!

251
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,375
Lee!

252
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,875
Lee, can we please talk?

253
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,375
What's there to talk about? You know,
this is just the way things go, right?

254
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,708
No, what... what do you mean?

255
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,791
It's just the way the world works,
you know. Friends leave. They grow apart.

256
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,166
We are...
we're gonna talk every single day,

257
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,041
and I will see you on holidays.

258
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,458
No, because I'm gonna...
gonna be with Rachel on holidays.

259
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,458
Okay, yeah, that's... that's fine.

260
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,250
But like you told her,
we're gonna make it work too.

261
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,833
And come on, dude. We just...
we landed a beach house, right?

262
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,958
We can make this summer a blast.

263
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,375
- I promise.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,750
Kind of like you promised
about rule number 19?

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,208
That is not fair.

266
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,875
I can't just
not be upset about this, Elle.

267
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,250
Okay, you're leaving me.

268
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,166
<i>I felt horrible
about hiding all this from Lee.</i>

269
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,625
<i>But the truth was I was leaving him,</i>

270
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,875
<i>no matter how much I wanted
to be at Berkeley with him too.</i>

271
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,541
<i>And it was killing me to see him so upset.</i>

272
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,833
<i>All I wanted to do</i>

273
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,250
<i>was show him how much he meant to me.</i>

274
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,625
Lee,

275
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,875
I don't know what's gonna happen.

276
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,541
But what I do know
is that no matter where we are,

277
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,375
you're always gonna be my best friend.

278
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,166
And I just happen

279
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,208
to be holding some list

280
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:59,208
that says
we could make this our best summer yet.

281
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,541
So, you're saying...

282
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,875
that we do this whole list this summer.

283
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,500
Our best summer we've ever had.

284
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,125
The best summer <i>ever</i>. Period.

285
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,083
I promise.

286
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,166
I mean, rule number 18.

287
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,708
Yeah.

288
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,416
You got into Harvard.

289
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,750
I got into freaking Harvard.

290
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,500
Congratulations.

291
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,333
<i>It was our last summer together...</i>

292
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,125
<i>And I was gonna make it count.</i>

293
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,583
The whole summer?

294
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,500
I promise I can still be here
whenever you need me to babysit,

295
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,875
so you could hang out
with, you know, uh, what's-her-name.

296
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,833
- Linda.
<i>- </i>Right. Linda.

297
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,833
But seriously, Dad,
I'll take care of everything, okay?

298
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,333
Things will be handled, all right?

299
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,583
Milk will be bought,
soccer will be played.

300
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,666
All chores will be done. I swear.

301
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,083
Brad has to be picked up
from soccer on Thursdays.

302

303

00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,166

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,541
- Absolutely. Fire away, man.
- Yes! Sick.

344
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,416
<i>Seems like a nice new friend.</i>

345
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,583
<i>Actually, it was nice
to know that Lee would have a friend</i>

346
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,666
<i>when he got to Berkeley.</i>

347
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,666
And I take it you're a Spider-Man fan too.

348
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
I don't know. Does driving 600 miles

349
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,458
to find a copy of <i>Amazing Spider-Man #3</i>
make me a fan?

350
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,375
That's another thing.
Oh, man. This is crazy.

351
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,958
<i>But I have to say,</i>

352
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:46,166
<i>it felt a little weird when I realized
that friend wasn't gonna be me.</i>

353
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,208
Oh!

354
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,166
You know what? I got... I got an idea.

355
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,083
To the, uh,
last summer at the beach house.

356
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,541
And the best summer ever! Period!

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,541
<i>Like I said,</i>

358
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,166
<i>gonna make it count.</i>

359
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,625
Good morning. It is one o'clock
in the afternoon, sunshine.

360
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,583
Sports drink and aspirin to your left.

361
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, yes, please.

362
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,750
Well, come on.
Aren't you gonna ask me why I woke you up?

363
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,875
- Why the hell did you wake me up?
- Oh, my God. I thought you'd never ask.

364
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,833
Well, Lee Flynn,

365
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,416
as promised, our bucket list.

366
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,291

and <i>very</i> intricately scheduled each item

Lee.

407
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,291
- Hey, May.
- You don't work here. Stop sweeping.

408
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,875
- But there's sand everywhere.
- Oh, sweet boy.

409
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,000
- Hey, Elle.
- Yeah.

410
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,875
So I have you working a double today.

411
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,333
And then I put you down
for those extra shifts you wanted.

412
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,625
- Extra shifts?
- Mm-hmm.

Uh, okay.

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,250
Is there a problem?

415
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,875
No, no, it's no problem. Thanks, May.

416
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,583
- Thank you.
- Okay.

417
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,541
<i>Yeah. No problem at all.</i>

418
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,666
Hey, that's my job.

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,333
Shh!

420
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,500
- Dude!
- Are you kidding? I just wanna help.

421
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,916
You know, we're not gonna be able
to do all of our bucket list items.

422
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,041
<i>Bucket list item number 22.</i>

423
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,000
<i>Live together at Berkeley.</i>

424
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,000
<i>This one was gonna be tricky.</i>

425
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,083
Hey, um...

426
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,916
I've been thinking.
And what if I just went up with you now?

427
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,583
Yeah, we go up to Berkeley.
We'll find an apartment, get set up.

428
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,208
It'll be like we're moving in together

429
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,208
without the actual,
you know, moving in part.

430
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,833
Hmm.

431
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,541
- I accept your offer.
- Ooh, yay!

432
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,458
Hi, guys. Sorry about the wait. I...

433
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,000
- Elle?
- Oh, my God.

434
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,000
Uh, hi.

435
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,875
How are you?

436
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,434
- Oh, my God. It's so good to see you.
- Elle, nice to see you.

437
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,666
- Hey.
- Hi.

438
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,166
Um, I haven't seen you since graduation.

439
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,916
W-what are you doing here?

440
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,958
Well, we were hungry.

441
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,500
That makes sense.
You are here, and you are hungry.

442
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,625
Um, of course.
What can I get you? Do you wanna go first?

443
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,208
I've got some recommendations for you.

444
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,041
- Hey.
- Hey.

445
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,250
Sorry for the weirdness earlier.

446
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,513
Oh, gosh. Don't worry about it.

447
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,583
I hope things can be cool for us,

448
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,666
since we'll probably run into each other
around here.

449
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,208
Of course it can. Yeah.

450
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,708
Um, are you hanging out
at the beach this summer?

451
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,083
Yeah, I just got a job lifeguarding
at the water park.

452
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,833
Oh, cool. Wait, wait, wait. Is that
the one with the giant go-kart track?

453
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,208
That is the one.

454
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,458
Interesting.

455
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,625
Um, question...

456
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,166
Hey.

457
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,583
Hey, loser. What you up to?

458
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,416
Uh, just doing some apartment hunting.

459
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,250
Good. Your last place smelled
like weird old cheese.

460
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,166
<i>Okay, so listen.</i>

461
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,500
The fam are gonna be
in LA earlier than I thought.

462
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,083
Oh, that's great.
You should come by our place for a bit.

463
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,351
- <i>Come crash if you want.</i>
- Are you sure Elle won't mind?

464
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,666
Maybe you should ask her first.

465
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,250
No, it's okay.
We're in a pretty good place right now.

466
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,333
<i>I think it'll be good.</i>

467
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,000
Cool, cool, cool. You think
you can pick me up when I get in?

468
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,083
- Yeah, of course.
- <i>Perfect. I'll text you the address.</i>

469
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,541
Okay, bye.

470
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,500
That's why it's so funny.

471
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,125
Actually, um, you rushed out of the house
so... so quickly this afternoon.

472
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,142
I didn't...
I didn't get a chance to ask you. I...

473
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,250
I'm sorry.
I've had, like, a million things going on.

474
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,708
But, um, ask me what?

475
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,125
Well, Chloe's actually gonna be in town,

476
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:30,500
and I told her it would maybe be cool if
she wanted to stay at our place for a bit.

477
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,833
Is that okay with you?

478
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,583
Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, absolutely.

479
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,458
As far as I'm concerned,
that is... that's ancient history.

480
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,833
And she can come
with us to the... the water park.

481
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,416
What's the water park?

482
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,958
Okay, so, totally random.

483
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,267
I ran into Marco and his family
eating at the restaurant,

484
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,208
and he actually has a job
at the water park.

485
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,750
So he's gonna help us
with this cool bucket list thingy.

486
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,666
Oh, cool. Marco.

487
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,750
Wait, that's...

488
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:02,083
That's kind of a double standard.
I was totally fine with Chloe.

489
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,416
Well, I didn't kiss Chloe.

490
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,618
I didn't mean for that
to come out the way that it did.

491
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,041
I'm... I'm really sorry.

492
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,083
It's okay.

493
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,583
Let's just drop it, okay?

494
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,458
Okay, it's dropped.

495
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,541
Okay.

496
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,375
I'm bored.

497
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,708
So you'll... you'll come to the water park?

498
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,916
- Yeah, yeah, I'll come.
- Okay.

499
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,041
And since you're going,

500
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,750
you can help Lee and I
with a bucket list item.

501
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:52,041
Oh, God. What... what is it?

502
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,750
What is the bucket list item?

503
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,250
- It's amazing.
- No.

504
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,000
- I'll let Lee fill you in.
- No.

505
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,208
And that's our epic plan for race day.

506
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,458
So, will you help us?

507
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,583
Absolutely not.

508
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,166
- Why the hell not?
- Look, Lee, I'm not gonna wear a costume.

509
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,416
I'll go, be there for Elle...

510
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,267
and whatever this, uh,
little mission is that you got going,

511
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,625
but, uh, that is it.

512
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,416
You know, if you spent less time
worrying about your bucket list,

513
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
you might be able
to get that taillight fixed.

514
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,166
I like it busted! And screw you!

515
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,625
What?

516
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,500
Did you really expect him to do it?

517
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,503
Well, yeah, I thought that, you know,
maybe this time he would actually...

518
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,375
No, no, not really.

519
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:39,958
Well, hey, anyway,

520
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,250
I just wanna let you know how much fun
it is having you here while I'm working.

521
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,053
- But I do have one question.
- What's that?

522
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:48,666
What does a girl gotta do
to get water on table 17?

523
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,541
- Chop, chop!
- Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.

524
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,000
Hey, Lee.

525
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:52,958
Hey!

526
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,541
- You ready to go?
- Definitely.

527
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,916
Ready to go where?

528
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,083
I, uh, invited Ashton
to go to the, uh, the comic book show.

529
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,250
Cool.

530
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,253
You didn't wanna go to that, did you?
I could stay here if you need me to.

531
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,291
No, no. Gosh, no. I... I gotta...

532
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,458
Gotta work, so...

533
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:10,375
- I catch you later?
- Catch you later!

534
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,041
<i>Was I a total hypocrite or what?</i>

535
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,458
Bye. Have fun.

536

<i>This was my fault, after all.</i>

537
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,541
<i>I was the one leaving Lee.</i>

538
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,750
<i>But even though I wanted
to be with Noah so badly,</i>

539
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,583
<i>I couldn't help wondering
if I should've chosen Berkeley</i>

540
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,125
<i>with Lee instead.</i>

541
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,041
- Hey! What are you doing here?
- Hey!

542
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,101
Wanted to stop by and say I got everything
set up for you at the water park.

543
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,208
No way! Oh, my God! Thank you so much.

544
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,333
No worries.

545
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,458
Is Noah helping out too?

546
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,125
You know, typical Noah.

547
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,958
We couldn't get him to wear the costume,
but he'll be there.

548
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:48,416
Is he gonna have any problem
with me being there?

549
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,958
No, no, no.
It'll be totally fine. Don't worry.

Okay, listen. The problem is
my dad actually thinks he can drive it.

570
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,750
What do you think
about coming down to the beach house

571
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,666
and spending the night with us?

572
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,892
You can bring <i>Mario Kart</i>.
I'll teach you the ramp jump.

573
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:12,000
- I think I'll go get my stuff.
- Great!

574
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,791
Awesome.
Do you want some nachos before we go?

575
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,000
- No, Linda already made me some.
- Linda?

576
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,791
Oh!

577
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,791
- So sorry.
- That's okay.

578
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,500
Here, here. Let me fix that.

579

- Oh.

580
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,666
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,666
Well, uh, wine disaster aside,
I'm really glad to meet you.

582
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,541
Uh, yeah. You too.

583
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,875
I'm really glad you're here.

584
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,791
Your dad and I were wondering
if you could have dinner with us soon.

585
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,875
Um, you know, I would love to,

586
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,875
but the restaurant has
me working such crazy hours lately.

587
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,291
Um, I... I think
I'm gonna have to pass on that.

588
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:48,958
Okay.

589
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,583
Well, your mom was an old friend of mine.

590
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:55,166
It'd be nice to talk about her with you,
but maybe we could do something else.

591
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,125
Yeah, maybe. Um, I... I...

592
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,666
But I'm... I'm kind of in a rush,
so I gotta get going.

593
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,916
It was nice to meet you.

594
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,625
No, you too.

595
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,000
Uh, Brad, I'll be in the car.

596
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,500
- Bye.
- Bye.

597
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,373
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Chloe!

598
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,500
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

599
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,791
- This is ridiculous. No, no, no, no!
- I'm in.

600
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:25,375
- Aww. No!
- I'm sorry.

601
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,666
Wow!

602
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,666
- Well, remind me never to play you again.
- Oh!

603
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,750
Maybe you
should have skipped this college thing.

604
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:33,875
You know, go pro.

605
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,666
Oh, my gosh.
I'm not that good, but thank you.

606
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,500
Oh, my God. Your brother is adorable.

607
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,041
Yeah, he's pretty cool.

608
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,541
Yeah, just, um, babysitting,
'cause my dad is on a date...

609
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,458
Okay.

610
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:56,250
...with his new, uh, girlfriend or whatever
he's calling her. I don't know.

611
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,875
I just met her. She's kind of annoying.

612
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:01,166
- No.
- Yeah.

613
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,541
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

614
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,583
all my friends hate
their dad's girlfriends.

615
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,739
Oh, well, I don't really, like...
I don't really hate her.

616
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:13,166
Don't worry about it, okay?
I promise you, it's pretty standard.

617
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,476
Everybody was wishing
they were dressed up like us.

618
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,083
What's great was all the looks
were out of pure jealousy.

619
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,416
- They wished they looked as cool as us.
- Yeah, yeah.

620
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,750
Where have you been?

621
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,633
When was the last time
you checked your phone?

622
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,250
Why? Didn't you go
to the... the comic book thingy?

623
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,541
She called it a thingy.

624
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:31,625
- I got this.
- All right.

625
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,291
So, yeah, we did end up going
to the comic book <i>show.</i>

626
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:37,750
But then after that,
we went up to meet with our friend Elle

627
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,875

630

- Yes! And it was spectacular.
- Out of this world.

631
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,625
- And Ashton got three holes in one.
- That's cool.

632
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,541
No. I... I just...

633
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,958
Anyway, I'm really sorry, Lee.

634
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,125

635
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,875
No, as long
as we're still good for tomorrow.

636
00:32:56,958 --> 00:33:01,083
- Yeah, come on. Prepped and ready to go.
- Cool. Also, Ashton's gonna come too.

It's so stupid.
I told her I'm not doing it.

647

00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,666
- Yahoo! Mario is number one.
- I'm coming for you, Evans.

682
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,250
Hope you're hungry.

683
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,916
Oh!

684
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,458
Aww!

685
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,375
Bloody hell!

686
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,833
- Sorry, Viv!
- Oh, this is great.

687
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,625
<i>Nice lap, Elle.</i>

688
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,125
<i>Watch your back, Chloe!</i>

689
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,605
<i>- Can a lady get through here?
- You got this, princess.</i>

690
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,958
- <i>I'm on it!
- Out of my way, Chloe!</i>

691
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,750
<i>Oh, here we go!</i>

692
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,250
Oh!

693
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,250
No!

694
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,500
Gonna have to try harder than that.

695
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,791
- Hey, Melvin. How we looking?
- Uh, mostly clear, Elle.

696
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,195
But Noah's trying to get through.

697
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,833
<i>Keep in formation, ladies.</i>

698
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,291
- <i>Let him have it.
- Your turn, Luigi.</i>

699
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,791
<i>Whoa! Good throw, man!</i>

700
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,125
Whoa!

701
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,625
Oh, my God!

702
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,958
<i>Marco's out of the race.</i>

703
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,583
Whoa!

704
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,000
<i>And now he's back!</i>

705
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,666
Go, Marco. Go!

706
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,125
Whoa!

707
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,250
Whoo!

708
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,500
- I got you, Evans.
- I don't think so.

709
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,166
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

710
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,458
She slimed me! I can't see!

711
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,958
- Gotcha!
- That was amazing!

712
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,708
Oh, Elle!

713
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,083
Oh, no.

714
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,708
- No!
- There can only be one!

715
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,416
You got me!

716
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,625
<i>Okay, guys,
coming up on your final lap.</i>

717
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:31,291
- Hey, pretty boy. What are you doing?
<i>- </i>Winning.

718
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,625
<i>You are dead meat.</i>

719
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,125
- <i>Lee!
- Sorry, Rach.</i>

720
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,958
<i>Rachel's out! And now there's an opening.</i>

721
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,892
- Whoa!
<i>- Marco and Noah are through.</i>

722
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,708
<i>Melvin, what's going on?</i>

723
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,916
Marco and Noah
are going at it pretty hard.

724
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,916
Uh, Noah.

725
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,208
<i>Noah, can you hear me?</i>

726
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,458
<i>Whoa!</i>

727
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,541
Noah!

728
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,750
<i>Noah is pulling ahead.</i>

729
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:03,208
<i>Now, it's Marco. They're neck-and-neck.</i>

730
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,833
Yeah!

731
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,750
<i>Marco wins!</i>

732
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:11,625
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

733
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,250
That was incredible.

734
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:21,708
What? Oh, it's glorious.

735
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:25,375
- That was insane!
- Oh, my God, guys, that was insane!

736
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,125
Hey, can you hold this for a sec?

737
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,208
Yeah.

738
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,625
Close one.

739
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,458
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's okay.

740
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,250
Come on.

741
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:57,041
- Don't be mad just 'cause you lost.
- You know what I keep thinking about?

742
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,625
Why the guy that you kissed
in front of the whole world

743
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,666
is wearing the costume
that you asked me to wear.

744
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,500
- Noah! You blow things out of proportion.
- Why's he wearing it?

745
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,458
It's very clear
that he's still after you...

746
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,726
He's not. There's nothing
going on between Marco and me.

747
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,430
If you think that he's not
still after you, then you're being naive.

748
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,583
It's embarrassing.

749
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,083
It's embarrassing.

750
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,250
God. I'll see you at the house.

751
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:28,541
Hey, thank you so much again for today.
It was amazing.

752
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,208
Of course. Any time.

753
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,583
You're the best.

754
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,625
Sounds like Noah was pretty upset.

755
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,708
You know what?

756
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:43,083
I don't even care.
What we just did was legendary.

757
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,708
I don't know.
I sort of think he might have a point.

758
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,291
What?

759
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,215
Listen, I just don't think
I would be too happy

760
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:54,875
if Rachel started hanging out
with an ex of hers all the time, you know?

761
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,916
Okay. First off, he's not my ex, Lee.

762
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,166
And second,
it takes two people to do something.

763
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,416
Which means Noah doesn't trust me.

764
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,500
It's him that I don't trust.

765
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,333
I mean,
he clearly still has feelings for her. So...

766
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:12,125
Look, if you trust her, then you gotta
believe what she says and nothing less.

767
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,041
Is everything okay?

768
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,666
Uh, yeah. It's just...
just stuff with my parents.

769
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,625
What's going on?

770
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,375
It's nothing.

771
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:32,708
My dad just told me that him and my mom
are getting a divorce,

772
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,751
and now they won't stop calling
to check up on me.

773
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,500
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, please.

774
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:39,250
Just don't make a big deal about it, okay?

775
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,291
Eight ball, corner pocket.

776
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,708
- Third time's the charm.
- Third time.

777
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,591
It's always the third time.
What's that about?

778
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,708
What is that?

779
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:03,958
What? Wait a minute.

780
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,125
What?

781
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:07,791
No way.

782
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,583
I cannot believe
they're getting rid of our <i>DDM </i>machine.

783
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:15,125
Wait. The <i>DDM </i>machine.

784
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,541
What are you doing?

785
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:21,500
I'm adding a final item to our list.

786
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,458
The last <i>DDM </i>dance on our machine.

787
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,083
July 5th. You'll be there, right?

788
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,416
<i>I don't know
if it was the fight with Noah</i>

789
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,083
<i>or that everyone seemed
to be coming at me at once,</i>

790
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:34,083
<i>but I was starting to feel overwhelmed.</i>

791
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,041
- What? You don't wanna do it?
- Of course I wanna do it.

792
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,708
But we literally have one month left
to finish the entire bucket list,

793
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,583
and then we leave for school.

794
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:45,625
Yeah.

795
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,416
I get it.

796
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,041
You got your hands full. It's okay.

797
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,101
<i>But just like Lee...</i>

798
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,583
Lee, hold on please.

799
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,333
I'll be there<i>.</i>

800
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:58,875
<i>...I wasn't ready to let go yet either.</i>

801
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,250
Okay. Thanks.

802
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:05,184
And we're still on for tonight?
All right, we put a lot of work in it.

803
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:08,416
- So we can't be late.
- Yeah, no, don't worry. I won't be late.

00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,625
I wanted to make up for yesterday.

808
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,208
This looks amazing.

You deserve it.

You're actually gonna go?
I mean, I made you dinner.

816
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,934
- I did this for you, and you're leaving?
- No, it's not like I wanna go.

I'm leaving him all alone.

Me asking you to come to Boston

820
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,875
isn't some, like, evil plot
to make you leave Lee behind.

821
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:20,250
No, I... I'm not...
That's not what I'm saying at all.

00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:58,291
<i>But every step closer we got
to finishing the list...</i>

852
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,208
Noah?

853
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:02,583
<i>...made me feel
like I was one step further away from him.</i>

854
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,125
You awake?

855
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:24,500
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

856
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,916
I'm painting the trim.

857
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,250
Okay, well, you can paint everything else
in this house, just not this doorway.

858
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,958
Well, Mom told me to do it, so...

859
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,708
I don't care what Mom said.
You're not painting this doorway.

860
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,791
- Stop being a jerk, man. Just move.
- I'm not moving!

861
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,750
Fine.

862
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,166
You're gonna have to sleep at some point.

863
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Brad!

864
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:13,125
Brad!

865
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,333
Brad!

866
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,708
- Brad?
- Yeah.

867
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:22,791
Thank God.

868
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,583
Where were you, dude?
I couldn't find you anywhere.

869
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:26,583
I'm right here.

870
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,625
Well, yeah,
but I was supposed to come get you.

871
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:31,875
Hey, Elle. I wasn't expecting you.
Can I get you a plate?

872
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,000
What?

873
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:37,041
No, no, I'm here because I was supposed
to get Brad, and I couldn't find him.

874
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,458
Oh, Elle, I'm so sorry.

875
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:41,791
Your dad told me how busy you were,
and I offered to pick up Brad.

876
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,250
Oh, didn't he text you?

877
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:46,750
No, he didn't.

878
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:50,208
What I would like, though,
is for you to contact me directly

879
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,666
if plans change.

880
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,125
I really am sorry.

881
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,458
But with you working
and grocery shopping and watching Brad,

882
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,708
I just felt like you might need a hand.

883
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:00,916
Well, you were wrong.

884
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,208
We've been taking care of ourselves
quite fine for a while now.

885
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,291
<i>Milk was bought.</i>

886
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:09,625
Are you okay?

887
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:11,958
<i>Just not this week.</i>

888
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,583
- Can I do anything?
- Mnh-mnh.

889
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,250
Nope. I got it covered.

890
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,041
How much longer on table 25?

891
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,291
Just hold your horses.

892
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,791
Whoa!

893
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:32,625
Son of a bitch!

894
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,416
Hey, you are working.

895
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,583
You... you doing okay?

896
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,166
Not really.

897
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:53,541
I still don't understand
why you guys ended up fighting.

898
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:57,416
I guess once we moved in together,
everything kind of fell apart.

899
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,083
Wait. So what, you're just gonna give up?

900
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:01,750
I'm not giving up.

901
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,083
I'm just tired of fighting.

902
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, then do something about it.

903
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:09,833
Like talk to her or fight for her.
Anything. God!

904
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,541
Between my family and the job,

905
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:16,333
and just trying to make it up to Lee
after lying about Berkeley,

906
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:19,416
I just feel like
I'm running around like a crazy person.

907
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,666
As far as living
with Noah in Boston goes...

908
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:26,166
Oh, gosh. How much time you got?

909
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,958
As much time as you need.

910
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,625
You're really sweet.

911
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,291
Hey, what's wrong?

912
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,250
Just go away.

913
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,875
No, I'm not going anywhere.
What's going on?

914
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:43,208
It's my parents. They just...

915
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:45,750
They don't even wanna try
and patch things up.

916
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,041
They just want out.

917
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,041
You know,

918
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,875
you see all the problems,
and you hear all the fights,

919
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:58,291
but you still think
they're gonna find a way to figure it out.

920
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,458
Listen, why don't I come back
at the end of your shift?

921
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:06,416
We can keep talking.

922
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,666
- Really?
- Sure.

923
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,916
Okay, yeah.

924
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,416
That'd be kinda nice.

925
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,583
Look at me.

926
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:19,083
I'm a 23-year-old woman, and I'm crying
because Mommy and Daddy are breaking up.

927
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,583
Stop.

928
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:23,250
God, I feel
so pathetic right now.

929
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,541
You don't have to do that.

930
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:27,583
Not with me.

931
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:31,875
Oh, gosh.

932
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:34,125
Should probably
get back to work.

933
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:37,083

Hey, dude. Could you, like, not mess up
that room? I just cleaned it.

972
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:28,041
Your mom has buyers coming
in, like, 30 minutes.

973
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,583
What have you been doing all morning?

974
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,791
You're doing it wrong. Here, gimme.

975
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:37,875
I do not understand
why you're helping her sell the house.

976
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:40,916
I'm not. I'm just taking care of it
like we promised.

977
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,291
- Boom! There you go.
- Whatever.

978
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:44,375
Traitor.

979
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:49,208
So what time do you wanna leave
for, uh, Berkeley next week?

980
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,625
- Oh. Oh, man.
- Elle...

981
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:55,125
I know. I know.
I know. I know, but listen.

982
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,848
Noah and I, like, literally just made up.

983
00:53:56,875 --> 00:54:00,458
And things have been kinda off lately,
so...

984
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,041
I feel like I should stick around.

985
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:03,375
Sure.

986
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:06,041
- It's fine.
- Thank you.

00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,416
- Hi.
<i>- Hey, Marco, um...</i>

990
00:54:57,708 --> 00:55:00,208
I just wanted to call, and... and, um...

991
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,666
say sorry about last night.

992
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,750
Uh, Noah came by,
and we, uh, sorted things out.

993
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,375
Oh.

994
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,083
Okay.

995
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,125
Uh, that's... that's great.

996
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:14,833
Yeah.

997
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,250
Um...

998
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,291
But thank you so much
for being there for me.

999
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,750
I mean, that really meant a lot.

1000
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,125
Yeah, of course.

1001
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:30,416
And if you ever wanna talk
or need anything,

1002
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,166
you know, just call me.

1003
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,250
<i>Okay?</i>

1004
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,916
<i>Day or night. I mean it.</i>

1005
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,583
Thank you.

1006
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,541
Um, I'll let you get back to work.

1007
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,833
Uh, take care.

1008
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,041
All right, bye.

1009
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:03,625
Hey, Tuppen. What's up, dude?

1010
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,166
Great.

1011
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,833
So what are you doing
for the Fourth of July?

1012
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:23,208
So I was cleaning out our room,
and then it just fell out of her bag.

1013
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,291
So what did you find?

1014
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:27,166
She had an acceptance letter to Berkeley.

1015
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,750
Which means that she was never
on the wait-list.

1016
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,750
- Wow!
- I guess she found out, like, in May.

1017
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:37,708
Well, I guess that that does show how much
she wants to be with you in Boston.

1018
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,458
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

1019
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,458
So, look what I got us.

1020
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:48,333
Oh, my God! Lee, how did you get these?

1021
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:49,916
Wait.

1022
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,250
These are for the concert on the 22nd.

1023
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:54,708
We're both in college orientation then.

1024
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:58,125
Yeah, I figure we could skip orientation
so that we could spend more time together.

1025
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,875
- Oh, hi, Ellen!
- Ellen, how are you?

1026
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,934
- Happy Fourth of July, Ellen!
- How are you?

1027
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:07,750
Welcome to the party.

1028
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:09,333
Hey!

1029
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:11,875
Oh, Randy! Okay, bye, Elle.

1030
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:13,458
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

1031
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:14,958
Hello, Randy!

1032
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:18,416
- Hey, I hope it's okay I'm here.
- Um...

1033
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,625
Tuppen was, like,
pushing me hard to tag along.

1034
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:24,125
Yeah, yeah, of course. Hi.

1035
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,791
- There's, you know, food and drinks...
- I can't believe that Marco showed up.

1036
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,583
I know.

1037
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:31,541
- So, have fun.
- Cool.

1038
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,458
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1039
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,666
Whoa! One to one.

1040
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,791
Let's go!

1041
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,000
All right. Whoo!

1042
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,791
- Oh!
- Whoo!

1043
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,416
- Ha ha!
- Come on!

1044
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,416
Whoo!

1045
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,000
MVP, baby!

1046
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,875
- Let's go!
- Match point. All tied up.

1047
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,541
Oh! Oh!

1048
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:18,458
- Good game, dude.
- Good game.

1049
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:21,083
- That's great.
- Yeah!

1050
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,333
Hey, close one.

1051
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,916
Yeah. Nice shot, asshole.

1052
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,375
You know, you shouldn't be a sore loser.

1053
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,625
And I'd appreciate it
if you watched your mouth.

1054
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:41,083
Yeah, I'm just trying to have a good time.
You're the one trying to hurt somebody.

1055
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,916
Hmm. And what are you trying to do?

1056
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:47,083
Look, this little innocent friend thing
you got going on,

1057
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:48,458
nobody's buying it.

1058
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:51,625
- It's very clear what you're here for.
- Really? What is that?

1059
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,208
You still want Elle.

1060
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:57,333
- You shut up.
- Guys, can you please stop this?

1061
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:01,416
You still want Elle,
and everybody here knows that.

1062
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,541
Yo, I said shut up.

1063
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:05,184
The sooner you get that through
your thick skull, the sooner you...

1064
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,416
Noah!

1065
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,541
I'm not doing this.

1066
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,333
You okay?

1067
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:36,416
Noah!

1068
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:41,250
Noah! Noah!

1069
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:43,666
Noah, please...

1070
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,083
Will you please say something?

1071
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:54,000
I asked you
not to let him back in our lives.

1072
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,000
Wait, Noah!

1073
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,083
Noah, wait.

1074
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,041
Elle! I am so sorry.

1075
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:18,708
- I cannot believe that you just did that.
- He... he was pushing me.

1076
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,666
- I didn't know what to do.
- I don't care!

1077
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,000
You just... you seriously...
you need to not be here right now.

1078
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,375
You just need to go.

1079
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:26,916
Look, Noah was right.

1080
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,291
And you know he was.

1081
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:38,208
Look, I know I've messed up a lot,

1082
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:41,333
but it doesn't change
how I feel about you.

1083
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,291
And I know you're not meant
to be with that guy.

1084
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:46,833
- No.
- Please just give me a chance and I'll...

1085
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:48,458
Stop it. Stop it! Stop!

1086
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,708
You need to go. Please.

1087

1088
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,708

1089
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:09,916
Yeah!

1090
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,958
- The game...
- ...is on!

1091
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,625
Okay. Brad, you do the honors.

1092
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,791
Is that your favorite game, Brad?

1093
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:21,375
- It is my favorite.
- Oh, wow! Yes!

1094
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:24,583
- I'm gonna set up these pieces.
- This one's for you.

1095
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,541
He's very particular.

1096
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,500
Oh, and I call the race car.

1097
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:31,101
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hang on.
We have to roll to pick our pieces.

1098
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,934
- Play by the rules!
- Okay.

1099
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:34,083
She's serious.

1100
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:37,208
All right, I got this. I got this.

1101
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:39,666
- Yes!
- Oh!

1102
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,625
I get to choose. Whoo!

1103
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:44,458
And I will choose the doggy.

1104
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:48,166
Oh, no, no, actually... sorry.
I'm... I'm always the Scottie.

1105
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,125
Come on, Elle. I rolled first.

1106
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:53,583
- Come on, Elle. Come on.
- I get the doggy. Right is right.

1107
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:55,500
It doesn't matter.

1108
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,916
Come on, Elle. Give her the piece.

1109
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:06,708
Sure. I'm just... yeah. I wasn't...
didn't really wanna play, anyway.

1110
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:10,375
Oh, no, hang on. You have it.
I want you to have it. Here.

1111
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,125
I don't really care what you want.

1112
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,958
- Elle!
- What?

1113
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:22,250
Well, I'm sorry, Dad. I'm...

1114
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:25,666
She can't just, like, walk into our lives
and be all part of it

1115
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,000
like she's just been here the whole time.

1116
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,583
Linda, you don't belong here.

1117
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,708
No matter how hard you're trying to.

1118
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:46,583
Elle!

1119
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:50,083
What was all that?

1120
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,750
I'm sorry, but I cannot stand her.

1121
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:55,875
The way that she's trying
to force herself into our lives.

1122
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:58,291
- What are you talking about?
- She's not Mom.

1123
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,000
She never will be.

1124
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,958
And I just think it's selfish of you
to even be doing it.

1125
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:06,041
- Selfish?
- Yes.

1126
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:08,666
I've spent the last six years of my life

1127
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,000
making sure
that you and Brad are my only priority.

1128
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,916
I put that part of my life on hold.

1129
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,500
I even took a job that I hate

1130
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,875
to earn more money
to help you with school.

1131
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,558
You stand there and you call me selfish?

1132
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:23,541
- Dad, I didn't realize... Dad, I had no...
- No, Elle. No.

1133
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,666
Do you really think
that you are the only person

1134
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,958
who needs love in their life?

1135
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:34,833
You have no idea
how disappointed in you I am right now.

1136
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:16,916
So...

1137
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:20,916
my mom told me a little secret
that I think I'll let you in on.

1138
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,833
There's, uh, two things in life
that are worth spending a little extra on.

1139
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,625
First one is, uh, quality trash bags.

1140
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,750
What's the other one?

1141
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,375
Bacon. Obviously.

1142
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,708
I really messed up yesterday.

1143
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:44,833
Your dad will forgive you.

1144
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:48,375
And Noah will come back.

1145
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,458
He always does.

1146
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:51,791
Yeah.

1147
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:55,041
- Thanks for helping me clean up.
- Of course.

1148
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,291
Rule number three.

1149
01:04:58,333 --> 01:05:01,083
<i>Rule number three is a good one.</i>

Um, are we still good

1152
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:11,458
Yeah.

1153
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,708
I'm glad you remembered.

1154
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:17,041
Of course. I wouldn't miss it.

1160
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:46,833
Hi.

1161
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:48,875
Hi.

1162
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,166
Um...

1163
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,541
you were right about Marco.

1164
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:01,375
And I'm really sorry.
I didn't handle that well at all.

1165
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,125
Yeah, I guess maybe
we both could've handled it differently.

1166
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:07,083
Yeah.

1167
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:09,833
We've been fighting a lot lately.

1168
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:11,291
I mean, I guess.

1169
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:14,500
But you know, I've...
I've just had so much pressure on me, and...

1170
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,500
we really haven't had
any alone time together.

1171
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:20,416
I think maybe it's more than that.

1172
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:33,458
Elle, you and I have been trying so hard.

1173
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:36,416
I know.

1174
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,583
Let's say we keep trying.

1175
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:44,083
But this and then in a year's time,
it doesn't work out

1176
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,500
and, you know,
you've moved across the country.

1177
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,500
You've given up
everything you wanted for me.

1178
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,500
Yeah,
but that's for me to decide.

1179
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:53,916
I... I think... I mean, I would think
that I would know what's best for me.

1180
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,250
No, you do. You... you do. You definitely
know what's best for you, but...

1181
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:03,041
I don't wanna be one of the people
who makes you put yourself last.

1182
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,250
What does that mean?

1183
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:09,291
Look, Elle, I don't wanna be responsible
for a decision you make

1184
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:10,375
that you're gonna regret.

1185
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:13,333
Listen, now, you can reapply at Berkeley.

1186
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:15,376
No, you can go to school with Lee
like you wanted.

1187
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,978
I just don't wanna be the one
that kept you from being with him.

1188
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:20,708
- It's my decision to go to Boston!
- I can't be respon...

1189
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,934
Why do you think you get
to decide these things for me?

1190
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:24,750
I'm not trying to decide anything...

1191
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:31,833
Look, I know better than trying
to stop you going to Boston.

1192
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:35,833
But if you do decide to go...

1193
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:40,583
...it's not gonna be with me.

1194
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:44,625
So, that's it?

1195
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:48,833
The fact that we love each other
means nothing?

1196
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:49,916
I do love you,

1197
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,541
but maybe sometimes loving each other
just isn't enough.

1198
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,208
Are you sure this is what you want?

1199
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:08,958
Yeah.

1200
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:22,833
<i>♪ Is all your love fading ♪</i>

1201
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:26,500

1204
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,000
No, no.

1205
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:51,958
Shit!

1206
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,125
Shit.

1207
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:57,958

1208
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:03,125

1210
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:21,208
Lee...

1211
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,833
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:09:24,416 --> 01:09:26,041
Somehow I'll make this up to you.

1213
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:29,625
That is what this entire summer was about.

1214
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,583
Making it up to me.

1215
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:33,458
Well, forget it.

1216
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,083
I don't need it.

1217
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:36,541
Please don't do this.

1218
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,541
Elle, I have nothing more
to say to you right now.

1219
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,458
You know that I wanted to be there.

1220
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,250
It's just this...
this thing happened with Noah.

1221
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:58,583
You seriously cannot be this upset.
It is just a game, Lee.

1222
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,958
Is that really
what you think this is about?

1223
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,916
The game? What, do you think I'm five?

1224
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,208
It's not just about the damn game, Elle.

1225
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,375
It's about you fighting
for our friendship.

1226
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:11,500
Lee, I know you're upset, but this is...

1227
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,333
And I don't matter to you, really.

1228
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:16,458
Not compared to him. I never have!

1229
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,791
You know what?

1230
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,166
God. It's like you are five.

1231
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,083
You have never had
to worry about anything.

1232
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:29,875
You've had everything handed
to you your whole life.

1233
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:33,458
And now,
you accuse me of not caring about you?

1234
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:36,583
You know, everything that I've done
this summer, everything,

1235
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:39,833
for you and for everybody,
just probably proves that I care too much.

1236
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:44,083
This was supposed
to be our best summer ever.

1237
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:46,500
But it was never gonna be

1238
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:50,708
because all of those things that just made
our summer so great before, that's gone,

1239
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:53,166
and we're never gonna get that back.

1240
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,166
But you know what? Maybe that's the point.

1241
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,958
Maybe we're not supposed to.

1242
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,958
At least those of us who have
to grow up at some point.

1243
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:04,041
Oh. Oh, and... and new rule.

1244
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:06,833
Yeah, all of our rules are done.

1245
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,125
<i>♪ If I can make your heart... ♪</i>

1246
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:24,291
<i>You can't hold on to someone.</i>

1247
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:27,541
<i>The tighter you hold on,
the more they wanna slip away.</i>

1248
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:30,083
<i>I should have taken my own advice.</i>

1249
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,083
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1250
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:41,708
<i>♪ For you to feel always loved ♪</i>

1251
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,583
<i>At some point in everyone's life,</i>

1252
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:50,333
<i>there will be a moment when you feel</i>

1253
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:54,541
<i>there isn't a single place on earth
where you actually belong.</i>

1254
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,916
<i>This was that moment for me.</i>

1255
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,083
Morning.

1256
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:08,958
Hey.

1257
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:11,333
I'm gonna head out,
so I just wanted to say goodbye.

1258
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,083
How are you?

1259
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:16,833
- I don't know if you heard, but...
- Noah called me.

1260
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,916
I'm really, really sorry.

1261
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,583
Things definitely didn't turn out
how I expected.

1262
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:25,916
No, for him either.

1263
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,833
But there is one thing I know,

1264
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:33,333
and that is that whether he was ready
for this relationship or not,

1265
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:36,125
he really does love you.

1266
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,708
Guess loving each other
isn't always enough.

1267
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:42,208
Maybe not.

1268
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:45,625
Sometimes the timing just isn't right.

1269
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:49,000
You take care of yourself.

1270
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,083
You too.

1271
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,666
For whatever it's worth...

1272
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,625
I want you to know

1273
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:08,375
that I think
you are an absolutely brilliant woman.

1274
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,791
Thank you, Chloe.

1275
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:29,333
Lee. Noah.

1276
01:13:29,416 --> 01:13:30,291
No, it's just me.

1277
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:32,291
- Oh, hey, uh...
- Hey.

1278
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:33,815
I didn't know you were coming today.

1279
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:35,666
I could've taken care
of whatever you needed.

1280
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,750
No, no, no, it's fine.

1281
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,541
I have to meet
with the environmental engineers anyway.

1282
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,291
They have to approve
any shoreline demolition.

1283
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:47,250
Wait. They're tearing the house down?

1284
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:49,416
Putting in condos.

1285
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,750
This day
is just getting worse and worse.

1286
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:56,500
Lee told me everything last night.

1287
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:58,791
Yeah.

1288
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:04,166
And, um, Noah and I
are pretty much done too.

1289
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:09,875
Elle, can I talk to you about something?

1290
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:11,583
Yeah.

1291
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,708
Other than Noah,

1292
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,500
why did you wanna go to Harvard?

1293
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,416
- What do you mean? It's Harvard.
- Yeah.

1294
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,833
- Why wouldn't I wanna go there?
- True.

1295
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,333
It's just that the whole time
I've heard you talking

1296
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:27,625
about where you
were going to go to school,

1297
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,333
I never once heard you talk

1298
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:32,208
about what you actually wanted
to study once you got there.

1299
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:36,333
Yeah, I mean, like, lots of people
figure out what they wanna study

1300
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:38,096
once they start
going to a college, though.

1301
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:39,166
I know.

1302
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:44,291
But did you ever stop
to think that maybe your choice of school

1303
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:46,875
had more to do
with what other people wanted for you

1304
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:48,833
rather than what you wanted for yourself?

1305
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:52,875
Maybe it's time that you think
about what it is that <i>you</i> want to do.

1306
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:56,458
Figure out what your dream is,
what you're passionate about

1307
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,958
and then choose a school based on that.

1308
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:04,333
And not let anyone
or anything change that.

1309
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,125
Thank you.

1310
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:09,666
Come here.

1311
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:15,333
Now you just have to figure out
what you're passionate about.

1312
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:18,666
Is that all?

1313
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:25,375
Hey.

1314
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,875
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

1315
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:31,291
Uh, what do you think
about this idea I'm working on?

1316
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:33,125
It's beautiful.

1317
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,333
Thank you.

1318
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:41,666
Hey, Lee, can we talk?

1319
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,750
Uh, yeah, what's up?

1320
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,541
Elle and Noah broke up.

1321
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:53,166
What?

1322
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,500
- You talked to her?
- Yeah.

1323
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,166
You should really call her.

1324
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:03,333
She doesn't wanna hear from me.

1325
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:05,625
Not after what I said to her.

1326
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,958
Well, everything that's happened
with Elle and Noah

1327
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:12,833
got me thinking about us.

1328
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,041
You know, I've watched them trying

1329
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,291
to keep up
their long-distance relationship,

1330
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:20,333
and I saw how hard it was.

1331
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:23,083
Rachel.

1332
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:29,291
- If I did something, I swear I can fix it.
- Lee, no, no. It's not you.

1333
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:35,291
School is gonna be really tough
for both of us.

1334
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,833
And I just don't think
that we should make it harder

1335
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:41,333
by trying to make a relationship work
from so far apart.

1336
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:44,750
So you're breaking up with me?

1337
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:48,416
You mean so much to me,

1338
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,958
and I just don't want
to see us end up like they did.

1339
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:57,416
And who knows? Maybe...
maybe if we're meant to be together,

1340
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:01,208
we'll find our way back to each other.

1341
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:04,333
But I love you.

1342
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:07,958
I love you too.

1343
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:31,291
I don't mean to, but...

1344
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:36,708
...I screw up a lot.

1345
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,458
And you've done so much for me.

1346
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:42,916
I would never want you to be unhappy.

1347
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:48,000
And I had no right
to stand in the way of you and Linda.

1348
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,958
I don't want you to be disappointed in me.

1349
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,875
I'm not disappointed in you, Elle.

1350
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,333
We all make mistakes.

1351
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:14,791
It's what you do after
that shows who you are.

1352
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:26,208
- Hey.
- Hi, Linda.

1353
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:28,208
What are you doing here?

1354
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:29,916
Linda...

1355
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:36,750
...I really just wanted to apologize
for my behavior the other night.

1356
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:39,750
The Scottie dog piece,

1357
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:43,458
it means a lot to me because that
was the piece that my mom always picked

1358
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:45,750
when we would play <i>Monopoly </i>together.

1359
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:47,333
And it was...

1360
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:50,184
Yeah, I know that sounds stupid.
It just... that's...

1361
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,416
No, it doesn't sound stupid at all.

1362
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,000

1363
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:56,458

Elle...

1365
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:07,041
...I would never dream
of trying to replace your mother,

1366
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:11,625
but I did care about her a lot,
and I have some stories that I'd love

1367
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:14,291
to share with you
if you wanna hear them.

1368
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:18,833
I would love that.

1369
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,458
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1370
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:24,583

Looking for someone?

1400
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:34,041
I have a feeling it's not me.

1401
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,666
But like you said...

1402
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:39,791
...I'm not the one.

1403
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:46,041
Well, apparently, neither is Noah. So...

1404
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:48,875
I'm sorry.

1405
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:52,583
But I'm glad we got a chance
to say goodbye before I go.

1406
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:55,000
- Finally pick a school?
- No.

1407
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,708
Gap year. I'm going to New York.

1408
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,666
I wanna try to work as a musician there.

1409
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,416
Wait, really?

1410
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,666
You never told me you wanted
to go to New York.

1411
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,291
I've always wanted to go.

1412
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:09,416
But besides my family, there was
only one thing keeping me in LA, and...

1413
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,208
and that's all over now.

1414
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,041
Well, good luck. You're gonna kill it.

1415
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:18,708
Thanks.

1416
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:22,583
It's my new moonshot.

1417
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:29,750
Well, goodbye, Elle Evans.

1418
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,875

Yeah.

1443
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:16,625
Why are you showing me this now?

1444
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:19,500
Because that's what I should have done
in the first place.

1445
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:21,416
You were right.

1446
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,666
You should've told me.

1447
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,250
And you would've been okay with that?

1448
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:30,166
No, probably not.

1449

See? This is what I mean. I...

1450
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,416
It took me hurting both of you

1451
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:41,000
to finally realize what the problem was.

1452
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:44,000
I just... I care about you both so much

1453
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:45,708
that I've spent my life,

1454
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:48,626
you know,
doing what's best for our relationships,

1455
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:51,791
but I haven't really gotten
to spend much time figuring out

1456
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:53,291
what would make me happy.

1457
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:55,833
What are you saying,
that I don't care about your happiness?

1458
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:59,291
No, no! It's not... it's not really
about anything that you did.

1459
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:04,375
It's holding something back
so that I wouldn't hurt you,

1460
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,625
even if it hurt me.

1461
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,250
You know?

1462
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:11,000
I just really have to stop doing that.

1463
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:18,666
I, uh, I heard about you and Noah.

1464
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,750
Yeah.

1465
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:23,791
So then come to Berkeley with me.
It's worth a shot.

1466
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:26,000
This is what I'm talking about, though.

1467
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:30,458
I chose Boston to be with Noah
and Berkeley to be with you.

1468
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,666
But I gotta figure out who I am.

1469
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:35,625
On my own.

1470
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:40,125
Come here.

1471
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,458
I'm really sorry
about what I said at the arcade.

1472
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:48,833
I didn't mean it.

1473
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:51,708
Yeah, you did.

1474
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,208
That's okay.

1475
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:58,791
A lot of it was true.

1476
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:03,791
Then I am sorry we didn't make this
our most memorable summer ever.

1477
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:07,500
I don't know.
That may be exactly what we did.

1478
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,041
So, um, you know where you wanna go?

1479
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,458
I think so.

1480
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:26,875
Come in.

1481
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:29,833
Hi, um...

1482
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,208
- I...
- Miss Evans.

1483
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:33,083
What a surprise.

1484
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:34,875
You remember me?

1485
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:38,375
You won the only dance competition
I have ever judged.

1486
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:41,416
So safe to say, "Yeah, I remember you."

1487
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,208
What can I do for you?

1488
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:50,166
Hey.

1489
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,208
Mom said you were taking off.

1490
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:54,041
Yeah, that's the plan.

1491
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:59,541
You knew she got accepted into Berkeley,
didn't you?

1492
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:01,583
What are you talking about?

1493
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:04,184
You ended things with Elle,
so that she wouldn't miss the chance

1494
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:06,375
of going to college with me
like we'd always planned.

1495
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,791
You know, there were a lot of reasons
Elle and I broke up.

1496
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:12,208
I didn't want her
to make a decision she was gonna regret.

1497
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,960
You know,
but just 'cause we're not dating anymore

1498
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:17,166
doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop protecting her.

1499
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:26,250
So, is she gonna go to Berkeley, or...

1500
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:34,541
No, actually.
She, uh, she's applying to USC.

1501
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,166
She wants to do video game design.

1502
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,250
All right.

1503
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,291
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1504
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,083
Yeah.

1505
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Hey.

1506
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,458
I'm not sure if it's my place
to say this or not,

1507
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:54,625
but that thing you said earlier
about always needing to protect Elle.

1508
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:56,416
It's not true.

1509
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,416
She's always been able
to take care of herself.

1510
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:03,291
The only thing she ever really needed
from you was...

1511
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,458
was for you to love her.

1512
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,500
Anyway...

1513
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,666

1554
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:17,500
<i>Your warmth, guidance and kindness</i>

1555
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:20,125
<i>have been some
of the best parts of my life.</i>

1556
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:23,833
<i>And I can't begin

1557
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,875
<i>Instead, I'm enclosing a small gift</i>

1558
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:30,666
<i>and sending it with all my love.</i>

1559
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:32,291
<i>Elle.</i>

1560
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:48,375
Hey.

1561
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:52,416
You didn't think I'd let you get away
without saying goodbye, did you?

1562
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,416
I was gonna stop
by your place on the way out.

1563
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,666
- Hey, you fixed your taillight.
- No, I didn't.

1564
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,208
- Noah.
- Yeah.

1565
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:07,291
- Um...
- I guess this is it.

1566
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:10,583
It feels so weird
to be leaving without you.

1567
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:19,166
I added a new one.

1568
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:24,458
"Rule number 35."

1569
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:27,750
"Always call your bestie
every time you miss them."

1570
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:31,083

1587
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:52,041
So, Mrs. Flynn,
I believe you'll find the paperwork

1588
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,250
for the sale of the properties in order.

1589
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:57,708
We only need this last signature
to finalize the deal.

1590
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:03,833
<i>And I can't begin to say
how thankful I am for it.</i>

1591
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,875
<i>Instead, I'm enclosing a small gift</i>

1592
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:10,875
<i>and sending it with all my love.</i>

1593
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,500
<i>Elle.</i>

1594
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:18,750
Is there a problem?

1595
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,166
Mrs. Flynn?

1596
01:34:22,791 --> 01:34:23,791
No.

1597
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,708
No problem at all.

1598
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:28,250
I'm just not selling this house.

1599
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:30,958
You'd be walking away from millions.

1600
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,375
All of these old homes
are being taken down.

1601
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:39,791
Just not this one.

1602
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,375
Good day, gentlemen.

1603
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,958
<i>Oh, that's a great one.</i>

1604
01:34:57,041 --> 01:35:00,375
- That one's so... the light is perfect.
- You think? I mean, I don't know.

1605
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:02,875
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Yeah, cool.

1606
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:04,500
Do you think that maybe I should...

1607
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,583
So you're going to USC?

1608
01:35:15,791 --> 01:35:18,083
Uh, I...

1609
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:21,333
Yeah, I have an interview
for their spring term next week.

1610
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:25,750
It's a really competitive program,
so I probably won't even get in.

1611
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,166
Are you kidding me?

1612
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:30,750
You put your mind to something, you do it.

1613
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,125
I don't know. We'll see.

1614
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:44,166
Hey, I'm sorry
that things didn't work out between us.

1615
01:35:45,541 --> 01:35:47,125
It is what it is, Noah.

1616
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,250
Me too.

1617
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:08,833
Don't forget me, okay?

1618
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:20,958
Goodbye, Noah.

1619
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:44,500
<i>Elle,
take care of our game while I'm away.</i>

1620
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,416
<i>Until our next dance.</i>

1621
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,125
<i>Your best friend, Lee.</i>

1622
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:54,083
Yeah. Classic Lee.

1623
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:59,666
One of the things that we do here,
at the video games department

1624
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:03,500
is we pitch and develop our own ideas
into finished products.

1625
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:06,958
We were hoping
that you might pitch any ideas you have

1626
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:09,958
for possible games or gaming products.

1627
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:13,833
Yeah, of course, totally, definitely.

1628
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:18,541
Oh, you mean, like, right now?

1629
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:22,583
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that
I was supposed to prepare that for today.

1630
01:37:23,166 --> 01:37:26,875
It doesn't have to be anything formal.
Just a sharing of concepts.

1631
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:28,916
Right, of course. Um...

1632
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:32,083
Um...

1633
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:33,666
I...

1634
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:36,375
Oh, my God. Um, I'm so sorry. There's...

1635
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:40,208
Nothing's coming to my mind.
I just... I don't know what to say.

1636
01:37:40,291 --> 01:37:42,166
Look, it's not a problem, Elle.

1637
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:45,625
Uh, actually,
I... I think we have everything we need.

1638
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:48,333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1639
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:50,041
Yeah, thank you.

1640
01:37:58,125 --> 01:37:59,333
I... I did have one idea.

1641
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:03,208
But it's... I mean,
it's really just more of a basic concept.

1642
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:05,916
Go ahead, Elle.

1643
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:08,875
Um...

1644
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:17,000
You know how in fantasy sports,
people draft real-world sports athletes,

1645
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:20,541
and the players' performances are used
to determine the success of...

1646
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:23,833
I think we're all aware
of how fantasy football works, Miss Evans.

1647
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:25,291
Cool, yeah, sorry.

1648
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:27,041
Um, of course.

1649
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:31,791
What if we were to apply that
to a large e-sports platform?

1650
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:34,601
Players could get together
at the beginning of the season

1651
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:38,583
and take turns drafting
their favorite pro players.

1652
01:38:38,666 --> 01:38:41,083
And you could even call it
"Fantas-E Sports."

1653
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:45,416
And fantasy football's, like,
a multimillion-dollar industry, right?

1654
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,166
It's $7 billion actually.

1655
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,458
See? There you go.

1656
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:54,791
And how much
is the e-sports industry raking in?

1657
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:57,375
Uh, two billion.

1658
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:01,500
So, I mean, it kind of seems
like that might be worth something.

1659
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:06,708
Oh, and I also have this other idea...

1660
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,125
Hey, what's up?

1661
01:39:12,791 --> 01:39:13,916
I think I got in!

1662
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Yes!

1663
01:39:15,041 --> 01:39:16,583
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1664
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:22,166
Okay, you have to tell me. What happened?

1665
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,833
Okay, so I got in there,
and I was so nervous...

1666
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:38,375
<i>♪ Be together, be together... ♪</i>

1667
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:50,208
<i>♪ Shake, shake my soul ♪</i>

01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:53,375

1671
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:15,250
<i>So Lee and Rachel did end up
getting back together again.</i>

1672
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:16,833
<i>It turns out that sometimes</i>

1673
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:19,250
<i>people do find their way back
to each other.</i>

1674
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,625
<i>Lee and I stayed connected
all through college.</i>

1675
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:25,666
<i>And after graduation,
Lee moved back to Los Angeles.</i>

1676
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:28,666
<i>And for us,
it was like no time had passed at all.</i>

1677
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:33,166
<i>We had both changed a lot,
but our friendship hadn't.</i>

1678
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,791
<i>And in the fall of that year,</i>

1679
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:38,458
<i>we all found our way back
to a very familiar place.</i>

1680
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:39,750
Oh, my God!

1681
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:42,000
No way!

1682
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,041
<i>And suddenly, there it was.</i>

1683
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:45,166
Lee!

1684
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:47,666
- They're still doing this?
- They're still doing this.

1685
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,625
Oh, my God!

1686
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,625
Aw!

1687
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:57,625
<i>The kids at school
were still using the Kissing Booth.</i>

1688
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,333
<i>And for just a second,</i>

1689
01:41:01,041 --> 01:41:04,000
<i>I felt the same thrill and rush</i>

1690
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:07,916
<i>that I felt the night I had my first kiss.</i>

1691
01:41:11,958 --> 01:41:13,375
<i>And then I saw him.</i>

1692
01:41:14,166 --> 01:41:15,166
<i>Again.</i>

1693
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,333
Hey, Shelly.

1694
01:41:20,791 --> 01:41:21,791
Hi, Noah.

1695
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,017
Noah!

1696
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:25,541
- Hey!
- Hey! Fancy seeing you here.

1697
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:28,101
- It's good to see you, brother.
- Ah, it's good to see you, bro.

1698
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:29,976
- Aww! Good to see you, guys.
- You too.

1699
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,059
- Congratulations again.
- Thank you.

1700
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:36,041
- When's the wedding? Have a date?
- Yeah, we're thinking, like, late May.

1701
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:38,875
Okay, late May. Can't wait.

1702
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,601
Well, we were talking about
maybe going and getting some churros.

1703
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:46,208
- Okay, churros.
- Were you now?

1704
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:48,226
So we'll catch up with you guys later?

1705
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:49,833
Yeah, it's good to see you, bro.

1706
01:41:49,916 --> 01:41:51,416
- You too.
- Bye.

1707
01:41:52,958 --> 01:41:55,083
- Wow.
- Can you believe this?

1708
01:41:55,166 --> 01:41:58,791
No, I don't wanna look at you.

1709
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:01,416
It's been a long time.

1710
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:02,500
Yeah.

1711
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:05,041
You look so business-y.

1712
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:08,500
Uh, I mean, don't let the suit fool you.
You know, I'm still a rebel.

1713
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:11,250
- Oh!
- Last Friday, left work 20 minutes early.

1714
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:12,708
Whoa!

1715
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:14,708
- I know. I don't like to talk about it.
- Okay.

1716
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:16,791
- Your secret's safe with me.
- Don't tell anyone.

1717
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:18,791
Oh, okay.

1718
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:22,625
Uh, so Lee told me about your job offers.

1719
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:25,666
There's a law firm in New York
and one in LA.

1720
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,416
I don't know which one
I'm gonna choose right now.

1721
01:42:29,916 --> 01:42:31,875
Congratulations. That's amazing.

1722
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:34,791
And Lee told me
that you're developing video games now.

1723
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:36,458
- Your own game?
- Yeah, yeah.

1724
01:42:36,541 --> 01:42:38,416
I'm designing games. It's great.

1725
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,958
I work at a really small company.

1726
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:41,791
- But there's great opportunity.
- Okay.

1727
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:46,291
And I have a lot of creative freedom,
so I really love it.

1728
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:48,000
Well, I'm glad.

1729
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:53,625
- What?
- I don't know, you just...

1730
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:55,958
You seem so grown up.

1731
01:42:58,208 --> 01:43:00,541
I was gonna say the same thing about you.

1732
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:06,583
You know, it feels like yesterday

1733
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:09,791
you were just crashing your scooter
down the driveway.

1734
01:43:10,458 --> 01:43:12,666
- Well, I'm a much better driver now.
- Oh.

1735
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,166
I even have my own motorcycle.

1736
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:15,250
Really?

1737
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:20,250
Okay, well, um,
I mean, when I'm in town again,

1738
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:22,291
we should go for a ride together.

1739
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:26,666
I mean, if you'd like that.

1740
01:43:27,833 --> 01:43:29,916
I would like that. That sounds fun.

1741
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:31,875
Great.

1742
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,041
Well, I've gotta...
I gotta go see some friends,

1743
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:38,416
and then I've got an early flight, so...

1744
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,851
- No, of course. No worries.
- But, no, I'll call you, okay?

1745
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:42,666
Sure. Yeah, if you've got time.

1746
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:45,083
I've got time.

1747
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:51,916
- I'm gonna go. Okay.
- Okay, all right.

1748
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,541
I'll see...

1749
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:54,958
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1750
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:56,708
- See you. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1751
01:43:56,791 --> 01:43:58,250
